> is there a path to 1.0 so there you know there sort of is like we have one internally but it's not something that we want to say publicly or anything like that yet because even if you know we've tried this in the past and and you know we'll I think it's important for us to still put information out if even if it's information that can sort of fluctuate a little bit to some degree, but generally even if I can sit there and be like this is just a plan maybe it'll change who knows people will still only hear that it's june one or I pulled that date out of my ass right you know now you're oh god I just I actually put 1.0 out there oh no please don't fire me, you know like people will still just hear that as a confirmation of a date, or even if they think that, sure it's just a plan and we but we end up not hitting that date they'll feel a little bit of disappointment or something you know and and and that there's that one element there's that external element right what will people think what are people gonna say but there's also the internal element of like giving us the the freedom and space to like make more time when we need it will put the team under less stress so that they can just focus on working and getting things done, that's true and so that's just again like at the end of the day we want to put like a good product out and we have to and stressing out the people who are making it it's not one way to get a good game
