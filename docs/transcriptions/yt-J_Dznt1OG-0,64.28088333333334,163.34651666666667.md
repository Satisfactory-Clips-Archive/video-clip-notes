> on with it conveyor belts let's do the thing I've created a little scenario here of some buildings that I've just kind of put down for myself and what we're going to try and do is the goal for this scenario is to create reinforced iron plates and these are available in the assembler here and so what we need fill reinforced iron plates are plates and screws iron plates and screws so that's what we need to make and so before we can make anything we need resources and this is a miner sitting on top of some iron ore and if we open that up it's not doing anything because has no power of course so let's make some power go down to power a biomass burner and we'll put that out here like this okay cool we have it we have a look in here it has no fuel so of course we need some fuel so I'm gonna run around and just pick up some leaves this isn't the only waited the only thing you can put into a by mass burner but it is what huh but it is what I'm gonna be putting in there for now and that's probably what you're gonna be doing in a bidding begining of the game just grabbing leaves and then putting them into the biomass burner so let's put some in here I'll use cheats to make my fuel lasts for you know like ever so here we go let's plug the and you can see that's like a green light on here now because it's working and that one has a red light so we plug the power line into the minor and we could see the light is gone green and the animations have started and it's gonna start digging out some
