> yo we didn't look at the satisfactory bingo submissions that people submitted i forgot about that yeah i have seen a couple of bingo submissions, i was even considering like making a bot command or something for that, so people could like shout out bingo and stuff like that when they do get it i've been i've been thinking of creating just like a little html5 app or something yeah that like like we can give it like a list a big list of bingo options and then it like randomly like when you load the page it randomly creates a bingo sheet for you and you can mark it so each person can go to that page and they'll like everyone will have a different bingo sheet and some people will win some people this yeah if anyone has been doing the bingo thing and and please let us know if you got bingo and i saw that bright bright shiny objects said that, that they've made one but yeah if anyone has used them and got bingo let us know you win a free car actually you don't i think maybe that's illegal for me to say that and please share, on twitter or whatever your bingo card so we can take a look yeah they've been pretty funny to watch i've seen once they're like oh snoot wearing a shirt where it's obvious that his camera is inverted and like jay's saying he wants to live there right yeah they've they've been so so so much fun yeah vominos is a classic bisexual lighting billy eilish which one the one that lied to about golf rip people who get that you could no one's been lied to it level spaghetti i think that was one of the cards i saw where like they had the middle one that was like them moving the goalpost about the golf post like that never happened guys jace says 100 more votes yeah no this never happened we talked about
