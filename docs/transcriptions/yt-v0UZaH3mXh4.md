> is it better during a multiplayer session to not destroy as many plants as possible or to destroy them as all for making the game run better as it was saying earlier right it doesn't make a difference during the game but if when starting the game yeah when you're when you're like starting in and you're loading in like everything the more plantation that's been destroyed the more network we need to replicate and in the beginning in the beginning exactly and, right now foliage is like one of the most expensive things over network apart from the conveyor belts so when you're booting in you can run into like issues where it takes forever to load in sometimes you can even like get stuck but we are working on those type of things we are looking into ways to improve, network bandwidth and general optimization we're working on pretty big overhaul of how like the save system works to kind of get around to be able to like work on those type of things, so like once once like we have the new save system in place we can start working on like a better way to segment the network stuff
