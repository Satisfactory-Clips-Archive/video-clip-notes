> what's my I've seen this question what's my favorite thing in update four it's at the hoverback 100 1000 the helper pack when we're, I should probably not say this but I'm going to do it anyway when when we're working in editor and we're like making trailer stuff and and building things for the trailer we're using hella sheets okay because we need to save time okay you have like we're not going to play the game like like regular when we're making scenes for for stuff like for instance let me show you this actually a little bit of a little bit of behind the scenes stuff here but let me see if I can boot up the, the patch nose video there you are what shut up all right let's see if I can find it all right so wait where's obs does switching right yeah so this scene took eight hours I don't know seven hours I think to to build using cheats and this scene is like six seconds in the patch notes video there's no way we're building that like the way you play the game so we have hella sheets cheats when we when we build stuff for trailers specifically and one of those cheats is being able to fly around it's really good, it makes bringing things really fast and it it's just like when you when you use that cheat in the game I mean I know people there's a mod for this as well right when people fly around and it's and it's just hella good I love it I can't I it's it's borderline- I need to like get used to, isn't that from josh no no no I built this this is me this is all me this is this is making super computers that's it, but, I was gonna say yeah so the flying mod is awesome and I it's almost like you kind of need to get used to vanilla after you use that for a while because you feel like I just want to fly around but the hover pack totally saves that for me the hover pack is like I think the hover pack is a little too slow but it totally makes it so that I like it's like using that g, can you give the hover pack way sooner that's that's what I think too that's what I want we should get mark on stream so we can harass him about that, yeah hover back makes you hate walking around exactly so like it's- I love that feature it's really nice so so I think that's my favorite, if anything if anything I think it should be like a resource, research thing maybe so you can like unlock it way sooner I don't know just stack it on the contarium, what's it called like herein surgery was already has like a ton of good stuff throw it in quartz what's what's what's in quartz what are you unlocking quartz I can't remember
