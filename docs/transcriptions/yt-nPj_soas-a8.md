### Transcript

> okay experimental saves be moved over to early access without issue or do we need to stay on experimental so you can make those the you can uh copy them over or whatever for early access um when the two versions match okay so when we release um update five on early access on you know the plan is tuesday next week when we do that then the early access version of the game and the experimental version of the game will match and at that point you can switch to early access and play back up your save files whenever you do make this switch just back them up anyway sometimes like cloud save get sort of back them up whenever you switch um and then yeah then you can play from early access but the the rule of thumb here is that um saves older saves can be loaded in newer versions of the game but newer versions of the game cannot be loaded in older versions of the game and more often than not experimental is newer than early access um yeah yes that's that's the best like rule of thumb really yeah
