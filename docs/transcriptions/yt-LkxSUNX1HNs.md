> do you ever play factorial I've, I've only played factorial one time I've actually been I've actually been watching someone play Factory recently, not really for the factorial content but for like kind of just the person that I like to watch, and I'm not gonna lie I'm like you know I kind of want to give this a another shot but I get the feeling I oh man I get the feeling if I if it bites me it's it's all over you know if the if the bug the factorial bug gets me it's all over I don't want to no no I have to stay true to my save file I had no I can't go down I can't put energy into a factory game because that those games Factory games take all my energy and all my time and if I'm gonna do it I can't cheat on my say my satisfactory save file like that I also have a Dyson Sphere program installed and I've been meaning to play that a bunch too and I'm like no no I need to if I'm gonna if I'm gonna sit down and apply myself to, Factory stuff- I need to do it with satisfactory and my save file do a Dyson stick yeah I want to I want to give it a try it looks really good yeah I think you guys are really spoiled for factory game content right it's pretty good we've got like the, effectora which I feel like is like I feel like that's the OG right like that's the OG Factory game and then you guys have satisfactory you got Dyson Sphere and I feel like they're really different too right like factorio satisfactory and dice you're like you would think oh it's all the same genre the same game but I feel like they're really not I feel like they're all like really different I don't know it's my opinion yeah same genre but they're very different which is really good because like I feel like you would think you know maybe I don't know 10 years ago something if you think like fact or five years ago Factory game genre it's kind of like you would just you would just have one thing one idea of what it would be but yeah hydrogen air is also in the same Corner as soon as you get into automation it has a lot of good stuff if you like this kind of stuff there's a lot of stuff there have you guys played Infinity Factory Infinity Factory is not really a factory game even though it has Factory in the game the the title and it it's it's sort of a factory there's like conveyor belts and stuff but it's more like a puzzle game oh infinite Factory is so good holy cow I streamed that into Oblivion yeah that game is really good I recommended fan Factory too super super fun game but it's not like a factory game like factorio and satisfactory where you make resources and stuff it's just like a bunch like a bunch of puzzles but it's really fun yeah when you say like that factory game genre sounds like work Factory genre is work my industry another good way I've heard of this I'm gonna write this down and check it out later, to be honest satisfactory is not a factory game I'm designing oh wait checking is moving, more buildings than my factors it depends some people are like designers and artists when it comes to satisfactory some people are you know number crunching efficiency chasing people I love how modded Minecraft often becomes modded Minecraft often becomes a factory I'm gonna play cool Minecraft is a really good game you know I always think about it guys tell me what you think about this all right here's a here's a you guys want an opinion on the internet do you guys want an opinion on the internet I'll give you one I'll give you an opinion on the internet are you guys ready all right get ready here here it is all right I think the best game ever made to this stage at this point hear me out is Minecraft I actually think so I actually do it is so good on some and I didn't really even play it I don't even I don't even play Minecraft right but like on every front like the gameplay is tight technically speaking it is tight it looks good you've got like all the Shader packs you can do it looks so good there's so much content mods so good I would say they're Community work as well fantastic and you would think oh company run by Microsoft it would be like kind of weird big company kind of weird Vibes I don't think so I think they've got really really good vibes with their Community stuff honestly mojango Minecraft wow actually so good I actually think it's the best game like and I don't think Minecraft is like a game for everyone necessarily you know maybe you don't like Minecraft that's fine all right- I don't I don't really mind play Minecraft personally but like if you take everything into account it's like holy crap Minecraft does like everything it's trying to do so well wow it's really impressive it's really impressive yeah you know it's it's really good yeah Minecraft is so so good can Minecraft do yes a cab yes I can unbelievable that no viable Minecraft competitors come out it is kind of interesting right because like voxel games are pretty popular there's a lot of voxel games but like nothing comes close to Minecraft it's it's just so good wow
