> there's a gold date that you guys want the game finished yeah i mean we have a goal date but i don't really want to say it because uh it is one of those things where like why would we why would we say the date now lock ourselves into that thing and then maybe we find that we can't make it in time but now we've said that it's going to be this date and everyone expects it to be this date and then we have to start delaying which is fine it's i think it's perfectly fine for developers to delay their games but why would why would we give you that date when like i don't see how we could be that confident you know like if if just like rent like pulling a date out of my ass right but if if it was like december next year how how could we know how could we plan one and a half years of content into the game and and deliver it you know what i mean and have it working well and not crunch and destroy the developers you know what i mean like yeah like like why would we why would we give a date you know i mean we haven't even given a date for update five yet because it's like we we have a date we sort of know when we think it's gonna be but are we gonna hit it maybe maybe not we actually you know we actually were pretty much on time for the last two updates i believe no wait uh update four and three point five i think we were pretty much on time four yeah so maybe we'll be on time with update five who knows the date is uh live on update uh five.satisfactory.com actually true
