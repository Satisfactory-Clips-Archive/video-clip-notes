### Transcript

> customizer wars that's so funny though so we get the color gun back oh man it would justify the color gun at least paintball is the new golf no damn it no it's not it grabs the paint gun from the trash and puts the paintball sticker on it color gun more like color gone splatoon factory that's pretty good actually yo isn't it possible like can I make a mini game in satisfactory where you do that thing or I guess I guess it only works with the color gun really because like it's too easy to use a customizer now you could have like if it's like 2v2 you can have like one person running around the customizer and like the other person is is they're supposed to protect that one and then you're supposed to hit the other person in the team right so, you constantly have to make that that decision like do I want to like go and kill the other person on the other team using the customizer or do I want to pretend my friend on my team, that's kind of you know what that's kind of a good mini game not gonna lie I just came up with that myself I didn't have any health chat at all yeah could be an interesting game mode
