### Transcript

> solar power is not gonna happen in the game uh there's there's clips flowing around where mark gives a really good uh explanation of this but i actually watched that clip recently so i think i have a pretty good way of like retelling it so the way the reason why we won't add solar power in the game specifically is because it's sort of like a infinite resource uh that you you can just like you can just build a ton of solar panels and you're in getting infinite power essentially there's nothing stopping you there essentially and we don't like that we don't like the fact that you can't you're not making like decisions surrounding power because there are power is supposed to be a little bit of a pain in your butt you're supposed to solve problems with power um and uh solar powers we just don't like even if we add like you know that oh the the night it doesn't collect any power or whatever like it's still pretty much you know the days are 45 minutes long the nights are like five minutes long so it's uh we don't we don't like solar power uh and the same thing with wind power we feel the same way like it's it's it's free power we've had that in the past in the early versions of satisfactory and we just didn't like it we didn't feel like there were any interesting decisions made with power um so we scrapped that the the one the only exception that mark kind of finds interesting but i don't know if that means that it's gonna be added is water power because then at least you're kind of limited to where you can place that you like you have to find like you know dams and build that and and um and you're kind of limited by the map in that sense that's the the only exceptions is something that we might be interested in but that's not something that we have set our minds to making um so don't know if that's gonna happen
