> is it planned to rework the train popping I don't know if we have plans for that do we, no plans at the moment no I know that we've been wanting to look into, making it so that trains can, do the siding thing or whatever yeah be a bit more clever with their path thing so like if if a train if a train is like occupying a block and another train like finds another way around then it should take that route sort of, yeah I know we sort of talked about that but I don't know I don't know what yeah what's actually happening with that actually because there's like we we recognize that there could be a need for that or a use for that right yeah but we don't know if we're actually doing it or not yeah we always have to weigh everything when it comes to these kind of things like against what we're doing else and like who is working on it and the person who's working on that who worked on the train path thing is very busy with a lot of other stuff that I think you guys will be very excited about in the future so, we always like weigh those things against each other, but maybe maybe we'll get around to it I don't know we'll see
