> is there a community guide on how to make factories that don't have a big performance in the game i'm willing to get into that niche i don't know if there is actually a community guide that sounds like a great page on the wiki or something if someone wanted to make it, but for the most part folks don't need to worry about that so much right but if you know like you're saying if you just want to get into that niche and you want to just build with, you know an efficient performance-wise, builds like you know of course you can go for that and it would be pretty good if like there was like a collection of information, hint now judge community wiki people i remember that in kibbet's, first video for update 4 when he started working on this new factory i remember he summarized pretty well like a lot of things that are currently issues in the game that we're gonna fix but things that like he was gonna build differently to be able to have like that humongous base which is like maybe one percent of our player base are ever going to have that big of a base but he he mentioned a bunch of stuff that like you want to build spread out and like build a few objects like there's a bunch of things that you can do but but like jace mentioned like you shouldn't really need to focus too much about that like we are optimizing the game for a reason that you're supposed to be able to build, and the thing is most people don't play to that point like even a lot of hardcore people still don't even reach that kind of level yeah like there's there's so much for instance the object limit that a lot of people talk about like not many people actually run into it like you have to really you have to you have to really try to get there
