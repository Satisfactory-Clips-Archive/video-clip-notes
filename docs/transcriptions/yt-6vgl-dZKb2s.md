> we should mention it here on the stream did we not mention it well maybe we talked about it last week oh sorry the video came out it was after this yeah never mind i'm just trying it was i'm trying to like rationalize like what happened last week like why did we not talk about it last week if it was because i have an app yeah yeah we must have learned about it on the wednesday or something like that like literally the day after let me uh let me have a look lego let's talk about that while i find the link here lego constructor yeah so a lot of folks may have seen it uh yeah link in the description there perfect oh yo yo yo so so let me just before we say anything else is this gonna be the new golf thing or like upvote the lego thing on our lego site guys uh but yeah it's so um somewhere in community nerdy legoists uh put together there's this website on lego where you can submit pretty much anything you want um and then community can vote on that and if it gets enough votes then it will be reviewed by like lego designers and it becomes like it's it's sort of like can potentially kick off the process of actually making a lego product so somebody put together uh a constructor on their lego site uh the yeah the constructor and it's super detailed it's really cool looking um i believe they have some how do you there's like a gif or something here maybe not um but yeah it's a constructor and it's like you can switch out that what it's producing uh i believe it's like 1600 pieces which is insane oh 1530 yeah it's pretty pretty juicy um and if you if you think this is cool you can help us upload it and uh maybe someone from lego will see it and be like that looks satisfactory that sounds hella dumb reject classic yeah no but it's really it's really clever um and uh made a little lego command that's true i think there we are yeah so there's uh there's the link for the uh the lego if you guys want to go there and support the project you know we did come together uh i think someone sort of mentioned this earlier make it like golf right we did come together and we we did a lot of up votes on the qa side for golf right um maybe maybe we could harness that energy for this and maybe this will actually happen yeah because this is something that we kind of do want to happen yeah yeah yeah true would css license it like i mean i i i don't i don't think we have thought through it much beyond this looks really cool yeah let's see what happens yeah exactly um and i don't know maybe maybe we're supposed to think about it a little bit more than that but we i don't know we just think it's we just think that having lego or some kind of brick version of um you know our buildings or whatever is is a great idea so we'll just see what people do with this yeah um and in the meantime hit that support button if that's something you think is cool looking yeah you need to get up to like 10k or something for it to be yeah exactly i think we need to get to 10k to get to the next phase guys and we're over halfway there i'm pretty sure we can do it yeah i believe i believe i believe yeah uh okay space elevator lego if if a constructor is 1500 pieces like i don't even want to imagine how much of a hassle it is to put together the space elevator how many pieces is that like millennium falcon that everybody minion falcon lego how many pieces is that because like i think that's one of the oh geez that's so easy wow jesus 900 yeah uh it's 7 000 pieces for the millennium falcon which is like a really intricate one and it's i mean i'm i don't think i'm a big enough fan of harry potter to investigate that's true um so yeah i'll put that on the q a side sorry uh the the lego site whatever close enough all right i saw i saw ready for the comment someone was like do you have to rename your twitch channel to coffee stain studios dave's now this is yeah sure coffee says studios days very good very good coffee stain studio dave nice yeah so bam we got a lot of like secret agenda topics typical star trek fan hang on i'm not a star trek fan i've never even read the anime no that's true it is a good manga though oh yeah have you watched the manga yeah it's really good yeah yeah yeah i only read anime um
