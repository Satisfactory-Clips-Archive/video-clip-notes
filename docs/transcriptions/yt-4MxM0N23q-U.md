> any tips on how to increase fps on large factories best tip I have really is not built everything in the same place if you spread it the more you spread it out the better but, you know this is not an infinite builder you're gonna run into limitations that's at one point or another so we are trying to optimize as much as we can and, we're gonna we always do that we've been doing that since day one, you know half the if you like some factors couldn't even run in older versions of the game and but the thing is like the here the more we optimize the more we push the boundary and people are always going to ask like can't you make it so I can have more factories like there's always gonna be a limit, so, we can never probably reach the point where like you know you can have perfect performance in a huge factory you know it's probably not possible yeah andrew is a good example of, people going a bit bit nuts and I don't like you know I think we can make things better all the time but you know it's always going to anders is always going to be able to push it everyone else is making a very mega factor is always going to be able to push it to the limit there's always going to be a limit
