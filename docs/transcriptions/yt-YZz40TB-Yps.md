### Transcript

> um for those yeah let's just do a real quick recap of a little bit of state of dev just if people are joining late or you just join us what's going on right now because we are kind of an active season of uh of the game now that update 5 is out on experimental we're working really hard on fixing all the bugs and we're pushing our patches left and right not so much left we last week because our patch system broke down on us but uh we got that sorted out now and we pushed a patch today no yesterday actually to fix some of the crashes and stuff like that and there are a few issues left but we're we're gonna roll out a few patches soon to address that as well um and uh yeah the release of update five will be available on early access branch um next week on november 23rd um that's when you can expect this plan guys so it's gonna be good to get the folks who play on early access you know um up to speed and and having uh all the the cool new features available to them yes it's gonna be it's gonna be good i think so too and uh just to reiterate to when it comes to dedicated servers um even though like we're gonna push um update five to early access version and there might be a like one or two patches after that because we make sure that it's stable and all that stuff but our dedicated servers we're gonna keep working on those uh sort of in parallel with update five coming out because you know the data gated servers are still kind of like early early sort of they're not like done per se there's still a couple of features we want to implement um so dedicated servers will you'll still see like updates to the dedicated servers once we rolled it out uh same with translations i believe i believe translations are also like happening continuously yeah um there might be something as well like with the dedicated servers because if we're on i can't remember what we were doing because if we're pushing to early access next week yeah and there will have to be different branches for the dedicated servers yeah something right yeah exactly so i think we're gonna because right now the way that is right now is that the default branch for sir dedicated servers are experimental so like they're they're we have an experimental branch for dedicated servers as well because you need to play on the same version like if you're playing an experimental the dedicated server also need needs to be experimental version right so they have to match um so once we push you know the dedicated servers out they we're going to match those two so like if you want to play on early access then you just need the early access branch for dedicated servers and vice versa if you want to play on experimental then you can use the experimental branch for dedicated servers on steam yeah and i'm pretty sure it's going to work the same way on epic once we get that out as well yeah i can't remember what the status is of that right now but i think it's we're working we're still working on getting it out on epic and i also know that like i still think that not everyone can get the dedicated servers on steam only people who own the game can get the dedicated servers on steam that's not what was intended at all and we still don't know how to fix that and we've talked to like valve and they've checked everything and they're like no it's all set correctly but yeah okay it's not working so uh so we don't really know what's happening there but hopefully um you know when they come out on epic as well then folks who own the game on epic will be able to get it through epic and we still intend on getting docker hub images up as well yeah so um yeah we're we're working on it we're working on it we're getting that juice down yeah you can you can use steam command to download it uh and even if you don't log into steam command i think you can still access them so like they are accessible for everyone anonymously they just don't show up for some people in their library even though they've said it um yeah yeah it's kind of weird yeah it's still accessible via steam command anyone can still get it by that but like that's a little tricky for some folks true story true story
