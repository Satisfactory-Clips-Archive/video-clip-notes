> have you read my latest crash report yo of course we have unless you're using mods then that crash report just gets tossed out it's funny we we get, we we like the crash reports when you if the game crashes you get that little window like oh your game crashed and it gives you like the call stack and it shows like oh do you want to send the report sending that report is automatically collected and then it creates like a report for us in the back end so we don't really we don't really see the reports, we only see like the collection of them and then if we're diving into a specific crash then sometimes we can collect all the like comments that you guys give us, and they're really neat when we do look for that, and here's the thing when you have mods installed we made it together with modders so that it like adds a flag to that crash and i believe around 80 of our crashes are from mods so, like there's no way for us when we get a crash report to know whether or not it was the mod that cost it or if it was our game that caused it so like we can't really work with that so we just like if we get a crash report that's from a modded game we just like ignore pretty much
