> it's a little different in that case, someone has also asked about what what about the engine upgrade we made a video on the engine upgrade two weeks ago, that was supposed to be out like last week it got delayed it's delayed again this the the state of it that I know right now is that there's a crash on startup so we're yeah we're off to a good start yeah so there's like it's it's, it's done it just kind of the game needs to start first yeah and then it's gonna be okay there's something with the, the audio implementation that apparently that's been, because we're using we're using using simon we use simon as audio called simon yeah yeah problem with it, we're working on that and also the christmas there was also like a mismatch of, of release schedule because we wanted the engine upgrade to be in the fixmas update but then we had merch issues as well to top it all off so we right we decided to release the fixmas update last week instead and prioritize that and fix all the stuff with the fixmas update before we start rolling into the engine upgrade, but hopefully we will see that this year at least the engine upgrade we don't have a lot of weeks left before our vacation hits but we're we're fingers crossed yeah if we're crashing on startup how are we off to a good start it's like you know if your car runs out of battery but then you like you jump start the car then you're good it's the same thing yep that's the exact same thing as in what's happening
