> found an annoying bug that was reported two years ago already do i make a new post no you uploaded it in in that case so if you wanna if you do know of a bug on if you find a bug on the q a side then make sure to upload that make sure to search the the keyway site make sure that like the thing that you're about to report maybe it's already been reported but honestly it doesn't matter too much like it's great if you do but like you don't have to like we won't miss because of that you know a lot of people always think that like if, if many people report the same bug and it doesn't get uploaded enough that like we don't know about it but that's not true we we read every single day what goes up on the q a side so like we kind of keep track of that, it's obviously easier for us to keep track of it if people upload one single thing on the qa site but we won't we don't miss anything like if any anyone knows about the issues with our game it's us for sure believe me
