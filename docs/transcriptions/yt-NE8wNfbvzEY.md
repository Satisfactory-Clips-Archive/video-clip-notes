> do you share the same oh stop moving stop shut stop stop trying to chat while i read this once you share this thing oh god damn it i need to pause this, did you have the same office building with programmers designers etc i learned that some developers have their cm working in a different building so our office is kind of big right now, we try to, yeah the way we space it out is like people within the sort of the same discipline sit together because the people that kind of like need to interact a lot with with each other sit together so it's more it's it's it's less about like what disciplines et cetera sit where it's more like which people interact with which people right so for instance our producers are always talking with our programmers so like recently our producers moved down to the off to the programming floor because it didn't make sense to like have the producers so far away from them, but but to a certain degree yes we have like people are sitting you know in their parts of the office and sometimes you know they're on different floors and stuff like that but it's not like we're sitting in a different building, we're all in the same building well except except that we literally are at the moment because we work from home so we live we we are in different buildings but when we work on site we're not in not only different buildings
