### Transcript

> We love what y'all have done with your
factories, with what little you've had. But what if you had more? Well, in Update 5,
we're adding more cosmetic build pieces. With the update
comes everything from slanted walls, more windows, new frame types, corner
walls, smaller pillars- -and BEAMS! Yeah, I was going to get to that. We've also updated
the look of the walkways, added walkway stairs,
and one of the most requested features: ramp railings! (laugh) Wow.
