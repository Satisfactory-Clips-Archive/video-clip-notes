> how much room for improvement do you think you guys still having performance is a little boost or potentially significant improvement to come so okay that question is really hard to answer and it's a question that we get all the time, it's hard to answer because we are you know we're always working on improvements to the game there's never been in patch where there hasn't been like some well maybe there's been a few but for the most part most of our patches have had some form of optimization going into it the thing is like optimizing the game at this point there are no like low hanging fruit there's nothing like oh if you just change this to this that will save so much rendering time right or cpu cycles or you know it's it's right now there's so many different things, so we're shaving off like really small incremental improvements here and there and we're doing that constantly so if you go back to like update three and play the game and like play big factors then, you will notice like there are significant improvements to performance, so so it's really hard for like individual updates to be able to say like now is when the improvement came for optimization it's it's there constantly right so I do believe that there are a bunch of really I think we're going to be able to see from today and like 1.0 I think there's going to be a significant optimization improvement but I don't think in between updates you won't probably want people to see that and it's kind of frustrating too because I think people also sort of get used to, how the game runs and we're also playing it and adding more to it which makes the game also like the more you build obviously the slower the game gets in a sense because it's a limited amount of resources your computer has so that feeling of like that we constantly need to do more that's always gonna be there so it's it's really hard to optimize for games like this, but I do think there's gonna be a I think yeah if you look from today and like for when we release 1.0 I think there's going to be a significant improvement in how the game runs but we'll be able to see it while it's happening I don't know you
