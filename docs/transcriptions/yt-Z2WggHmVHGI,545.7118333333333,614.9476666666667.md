> using mods but my game is crashing can you help so we get a lot of people asking for help with crashes etc um and they're but they're using modded games or that they had used mods before on that save file uh and then remove the mods but the mod still had some sort of like lingering crash effect or something we've had that happen in the past as well and unfortunately we cannot help folks out with that uh it's just it's too time consuming it doesn't always end up that we can actually even help anybody anyway we don't know how the mods work we don't know how the mods interact you know we don't officially even support these mods so we can't really help people out so if you have any issues with mods please consider going to the modding discord talk to people there see if anyone can give you some insight unfortunately us coffee stain can't really help you out with mods at the moment you're using the mods at your own risk if you do choose to use them that's just one thing that i need to throw out there actually one thing i will say real quick is that if you do use the satisfactory mod manager to install mods please be sure to use that to uninstall the mods when you want to uninstall them we've found that people have uh lingering crashes etc if they try and uninstall a mod manually so make sure
