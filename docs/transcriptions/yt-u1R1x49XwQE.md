> but I love the the I don't know how many came here from the tweet parade, brigade but I love all the update four questions, I regret making that tweet now, but yeah so so so again update four is like rough estimate, end of the year or next year early next year, and if you know us by now you know that when we say end of year we meet next year okay, so yeah so march next year I don't think march I think march is is a bit late because that's like honestly so so the thing here is that like why is this so much time between update 3 and update 4. honestly this steam release was so much bigger than we thought it would be, there was so much work that we needed to do for like the the interplay and like the the build system that we need to set up I don't think we anticipated to be that much work, and I don't think anybody expecting it expected it to be that much work because whatever just ported to steam and like it's the same game right, a lot of work that went into the steam version did go into like stuff like dedicated servers and and a bit of work that went into like fixing up the three related stuff, so like- I think we didn't anticipate the steam release taking so much time, and the steam release didn't really isn't really like you know a new update release it's like it's it's a big release for us because we released on on steam, and it's drawn in a lot of new players from steam which we're really happy about, but yeah I don't think we expected it to be that much work, and I think it affected it a little bit also covid kind also affected us a lot I believe, so I'm just making up excuses at this point, , so yeah that's but but like it feels pretty good coming back from vacation now when we're having our programming meetings, and like we're also having a bit of like what's the word kind of like we're we we're looking at our internal processes as well how we make games and how we work together we're also doing a lot of changes, regarding to that, I believe and it feels pretty good, so yeah I think I think I like I'm very optimistic for update4 to be honest like I think there's a lot of good stuff happening in the future, and I'm excited like it's hard for me to like kind of like envision like oh what's this what's it gonna be, because there are so many ideas that are floating around exactly what update four will be look like you know with update three we kind of like when we said pipes we're like oh we have these ideas I'm like we knew like oh pipes is gonna change all this stuff whereas, we update four like there's so many things flying around in the air and and- I like I don't have a good grasp on it our game director does like our producer do, too bad I'm not them so hopefully we'll bring them on stream and maybe they can talk a bit more about that, and maybe a leak a little bit but but yeah that's just the way the cooker crumbles right now
