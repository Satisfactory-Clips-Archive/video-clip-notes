> arachnophilia mode everyone plays everything with spiders nah nice ah [ __ ] I kind of I guess we could mark everything as spiders and then put images of spiders I like with this one or that wouldn't work that wouldn't work out this is a halloween like traumatization like trauma halloween mod yeah yeah and every time you play it's rng whether it turns on oh my god calm down satan yeah I'll be able to upload a picture of jason's face to replace the spiders I think there's a mod there's a mod for that there's already a mod yeah it's all we did I like that you implemented reconfigure mode even though I love spiders I have problems with the accessibility thing because wouldn't it be annoying developers to have to think of all these things, you can't think of any everything and I think people who don't like can say that they don't like accessibility things, and then say well if we do one thing we got to do everything- I hate that argument because you're completely wrong, you don't have to do everything at all but there are some things that are quite big and you can choose to do them or not and spiders are actually the most, in terms of like arachnophobia is the most prevalent phobia with within animals and we have spiders that quite frankly don't need to be spiders, and so so it's absolutely an accessibility thing that we could do which makes perfect sense we did a really quick and dirty solution helps a lot of people it's like why not, the other reason there's a person with arachnophobia in the office so they couldn't work on the game without without it so, yeah so I know- I hate that thing when everyone's like if you do one thing you go do everything no you don't you just do what as much as you can or as much as you want or don't do any if you really don't want to it's up to you as far as you justify like yeah we have other accessibility options so and like the more the better it's like it's just the same as doing colorblind yeah stuff for colorblind well if you get a you know, account for colorblind why not account for everything yes like oh okay sure dude if we think we would just try and get as far as we can if we could we would I mean we're never we would never do it that's a it's a crazy thing that you do everything but, just hiring accessibility specialist same as you would translator we could get a yeah I mean like even an accessibility specialist couldn't even do what the the argument is someone could say well these are the way you solve all these accessibility things and then developers will sit there going okay but that's a lot of things that we need to do because there are so many accessibility things but but there are common things like for example, hard of hearing folks yeah it's like well why did we take the time to care about them it's because they want to hear like it's you know we had to make a bunch of changes because people who had hard of hearing couldn't use certain tools in the game, so we had to make up systems for them and it was a good idea any plans for better accessibility for us that are colored efficient productivity displays on machines are impossible yeah that's been like yeah yeah that's been in there forever and yeah it's it's like tricky to solve is it it's it's something like because the lighting changes the way you perceive those guys so we've done like one change like we've done one pass of like trying to change it, but I believe we have plans for it like or if it's coming I don't quite remember I wonder if it's just something that's just dropped off of the wayside I feel like it's a very solvable maybe I don't remember because I remember talking about it with, your artists yeah, but we know about that issue, and, hopefully we can get that that's a yeah that's definitely an old one for sure yeah that's why I love grounded they turn their spiders into harmless blobs yeah for sure, and and like they've got a really complex system in grounded and I think that's great considering that you know spiders play a really big and key role in their game right so- I think it makes a lot of sense for them to spend some time and yeah some love on it whereas in our case they don't really spend you know they're not like a massive part of the game switching to cat faces is it's a solution is is a very quick solution- I made it in a day, yeah well you actually made something in a day the first time oh

> I have more reasons for weapons in the future I think there's gonna be expansion on weapons and there's gonna be more monsters I know at least one monster at least I'm a grass man even tiny spiders get the daylights out of me yeah I just said grass man I was like and and that's that's another thing with, arachnophobia is, and it is like, some folks say that spy oh yeah spiders are creepy so I don't want to see them that's fine we have a mode for that and some folks are like the cats they're kind of creepy as well they're a little scary you know like I jump when I see them and it's like okay but but there's something completely different between something being scary and a phobia a phobia is like a strong irrational response within your body it's physical it's mental and it completely [ __ ] with you, and you know some people you know the heart rate increases start sweating apart anxiety attacks mom spaghetti literally like sensations and and hallucinations of spiders walking on the things like that it's like why not make a moat anyway I talked about that enough I farted that was someone read it very fitting that's that's the way we can move on yes that's our segway right
