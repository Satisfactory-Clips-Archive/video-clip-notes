> so yeah that's state of dev essentially like yeah like no no update on the date so last week we gave you a preliminary potential release dates for update 4 but we, we don't know for sure we're just giving you our current guesses and we guessed 9th or 16th of march, as far as I know that guest hasn't changed yet and it is still a guess I've seen some content creators out there saying that the, official release date has been set it is not all right I don't know how many times I gotta say it's we're guessing all right, this is the best guess all right so we'll see it can change I can't believe it like- I emphasized it so much and then there were videos afterwards of people saying I just saw it I just saw it on the stream it's been officially confirmed 9th of march guys come on I'm trusting you I'm trusting you to be better than this locked in march 9th got it short car no there was a question mark it's okay total we see it it's all about it's all about that clip bait we get it we get it yeah, so yeah unofficial official I guess or not I don't know it's not setting stone it's our guess we'll let you know once once we know for sure it's gonna happen then we will let you guys know and we'll throw the whole confirmed charade around which is likely usually the way things work is like about two weeks beforehand we can usually be pretty sure that it's we can lock in a specific date so I guess, maybe I don't know second of march or the week before second of march in in a few maybe three weeks time maybe we'll give a better you know we can lock it in maybe how about those release dates oh it's coming up in two weeks before all right not fired for leaking info wasn't leaked by the way oh I was told all right what are you talking about it wasn't leaked it was scripted it was very good yeah we did a great job I mean it doesn't matter what we say at this point because people will believe whatever they want to believe but, well but it was totally not like I did a totally didn't [ __ ] up okay let's just let's move on okay, so yeah that's that's essentially state of dev, we're still working on the update and, hopefully soon we'll be able to like lock in exactly what goes in and blah blah blah yep
