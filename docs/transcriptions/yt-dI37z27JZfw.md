> are the plans for better splitters like with configurable ratios that's another good one to post on the qa side, it's it's not out of this world that we do something about that, there is a concern when I talk to mark about it that like having you know a magical ratio splitter would remove some of the, what would you say like the extendability of splitters with the game because a lot of, a big aspect of you know our game compared to a lot of factory games is really the ratio, stuff in our game so you know what you're really solving in satisfactory compared to a lot of other factory games is is how to handle the ratio of production and the scary thing is that that's such a huge pillar of our game if we make that aspect too easy, it might ruin the game, might not it's not like it might be good like maybe not but we we really want to like figure out what we want to do there because if we just add a splitter that's magic like you can set it to whatever, we're not quite like that can impact the game quite severely, but it's not impossible yeah there wouldn't be any trade offs exactly and and it's it's very important when it comes to game design that nothing is ever given for free because like if you can optimize like if you give a player the option to optimize away the fun they will do it every time

> so it's it's very important that we don't remove that aspect of the game, but if if ratio splitting does that we don't know so that's something we need to investigate before we can make any claims as to if it would do it or not and we haven't looked into it yet
