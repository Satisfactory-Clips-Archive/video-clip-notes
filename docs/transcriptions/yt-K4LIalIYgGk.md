### Transcript

> mm-hmm yeah, all right so let's talk a little bit about update four the, the latest and greatest update that's still not out but it's soon out soon out, and, yeah so what was the goal with update four specifically what do we want to accomplish with that update and when we started talking about it i actually wanted to do something else so actually i wanted to update for it to be power and, the pipe update that we did right which we called the fluid update but it actually didn't update anything about fluids it update pipes and logistics, that was my intention because i saw the most worry still with the pipe thing because i didn't really feel like we did everything that i wanted to achieve when with update free like i didn't feel that package was completed, and then the power thing was something that for some reason was in the backlog where the idea was we want to overhaul the power system we want to change the power system, then the idea was that we actually wanted a bigger update and we didn't feel that power and just some pipe editions was going to be like a big splash we wanted to have another like big wave like update free because it has worked so well for us like player retention when the upsells went up players seemed to really enjoy it, so we kind of wanted to try that again with like a huge content drop and those two topics didn't really facilitate that so then we started looking at what we still had to do and yeah tier eight was kind of the logical choice for like a huge content drop because it just it needs a lot of stuff right it just needs so i guess that was the main thought process we just wanted like a big big chunk of stuff so from there we said okay we still need to do the pipe stuff because it's important so let's do a small update first quickly push that out and get all those things rolling, and combined with that we just did some things that have been lingering like jump pads were have been forever so we changed them to be better, the whole wall power pulled the ceiling and and instantly turning into wall power poles when you aim at the wall all that stuff, yeah and then the whole power thing didn't really happen we made way smaller changes than actually intended we had this whole system in mind with crazy stuff and capacity on power lines but we just felt it wasn't actually gonna make the game more fun right which is gonna make things different maybe more complex yeah because that kind of didn't come yeah sorry yeah i have seen like people i remember some of the early design discussion not a design discussion but like the technical depth that would go into if we were to change make those power changes i remember seeing some of the steam posts where people were like asking for like i wish i wish they would have done this instead with power and then people are like no and i'm like well glad we didn't do that then with like the power distance or the falloff of power and stuff like that, yeah i don't think it's a necessarily bad idea but the problem was where it came from it didn't really come from either players asking for it necessarily or us having this great concept for what we could do with it and make it extremely fun it just came from this idea that power wasn't really that well thought out a system wise i didn't offer enough gameplay potential that was also kind of an idea there but it didn't come from the right place i think right, so i'm also happy that we didn't push through with it especially because there's so many other things that we want to achieve it's it's not worth it to grab something that you're not sure about got it
