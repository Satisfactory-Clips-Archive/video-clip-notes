### Transcript

> when will next patch even get released so i said this earlier but i said again we we don't really know for sure, we also don't know how we're going to distribute the update like if it's going to be one big update at the end of the year or something like that or if it's going to be next year we don't really know i know that jay said last week that it might be at the end of this year which is it's possible but it's also us we also don't know if it's going to be like one big chunk or if we're going to like do minor updates before the big update 4 thing, not sure not sure that's like one of the reasons why we can't really say when because we don't know how we will release it you know it's something that we're discussing very vigorously
