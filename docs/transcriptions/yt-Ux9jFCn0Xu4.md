### Transcript

> the snowballs get the old animation again or is that gone I don't know honestly like it's it's such a bummer I really hope we can bring him back, in some way because it is a bummer it's like both that the animation is gone but also you could throw snowballs further before which you can't right now, so I don't know we won't be able to bring that back this year maybe in the future updates we will be able to maybe but that's the way it is and it's it's kind of like we we don't like it either like, we wish we wouldn't have had to do that change but, we didn't have a lot of time for fixmas so that's that's mostly why we did it this way the same time
