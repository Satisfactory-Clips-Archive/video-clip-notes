### Transcript

> here's a pretty good question actually I don't know the answer to this but do you think you can place water extractors on like the shallow part I don't think so right oh, I think you might be able to oh really I mean definitely these parts like the the chord part, so that might be fun, but yeah this is a while back that we established this I've completely forgotten- I'm not sure let's assume no let's assume now because there are a couple of places on the map where there are like really shallow like parts water parks water parts where we don't allow it and I think that's a conscious decision yeah it's going to be like a sort of a design challenge and also you know like loads of people are just like oh I can't place extractors here well I guess I'm just build building the entire ocean full of water restrictions yeah and you can always still do that, it's not like water is far away from you at this point anyways
