> so one thing I've been meaning to talk about for a while but we couldn't, is unreal engine five if you guys didn't know unreal epic released like sort of an early preview of unreal engine five, and a lot of people have been asking about like oh does that mean the satisfaction is going to come to really five we don't know you guys like it's it's way too early to tell already, and like we don't fully know what benefits we actually are going to get from 1995 for satisfactory specifically because satisfactory has been built with the current gen and it's been built with like a lot of a lot of limitations that existed at some point in unreal engine it's like we've had to make our own systems for that, and some systems we've been able to like when we upgrade the current versions of a real engine we can like sometimes get around that for instance one thing that we're currently trying to fix it's been super bugging us but we're using a our own like plug-in for v-wise and it's super annoying that we have to like constantly rely on our own implementation of that so every time we upgrade the engine that plug-in causes a ton of issues so now we but now there were things in that plug-in that we didn't have in the regular release of v-wise but now the regular v-wise version supports that so now we're trying to like go back to using the vanilla version of that and it's just like so many issues yeah yeah, so so it's it's not as e like we don't know essentially it's the tldr of whether or not we can have some relation five yeah and and like what's saying the we don't know what benefit we'll get right like and it's it's sort of easy to see like the stuff that's shared online and on the trailers where like I've seen this one person who made you know the default ue like unreal engine model the the guy the mannequin looking guy someone made that mannequin out of mannequins out of the mannequin really yeah yeah yeah so it was like they just like shoved all these mannequins into a small space and then zoomed out and it looked like they made a mannequin using the mannequin so it was like it was insane you know number of like policy [ __ ] in the in the scene and objects but but like it didn't matter at all right so now that doesn't mean we will get that you know even if we update to the engine that doesn't mean we just get all of that stuff for free and we're just going to immediately get all those wins and that's if we can upgrade to the engine, and when it makes sense the the other thing is like as like as essentially as far as we're concerned the the engine's not even out it's in early access like we're not going to be upgrading to 105 while it's in early access so for all intents and purposes it's not even out it's not even on the table at the moment really, so yeah I mean the the short answer is no we're not upgrading up 105. the long answer is we might eventually one day if it becomes you know when it's out of early access but even if we do that it doesn't mean we're going to get all these fantastic things that you see online yes yeah that is true
