> um and that's sort of the the big like changes that we've done to vehicles uh there's one more thing wasn't there there's one more there's the uh the truck station can switch out nodes yeah yeah this here so if you put a truck station down on an existing path it will now reshape the path recreate the nodes and create a docking node there for the truck yeah for the truck station uh so you can add trucks uh after the fact which i think some people were really impressed by i saw we got a lot of good reactions to that one nice um it was yeah like a little bonus feature at the end of the video there but um some people really liked it and and like i guess one limitation that we also introduced with this system is that now like routes need to be closed paths um due to like the uh like calculating fuel and this feature um etc etc yeah the main thing with the the the closed path thing is yeah basically because we wanted a way for vehicles to be able to calculate how much fuel that they that they need so that they know how much they need to take and in order that happen you need to have a closed loop right um and yeah that's basically that and and that's the inten the intended use of recording parts anyway so uh i don't think this is really a limitation that's kind of screwing anyone over or anything like that yeah those people are pretty pretty happy with that i think yeah i've seen everyone been pretty pretty fine with it it's all right so if you want to know more about this stuff we're just like kind of glancing over this right now and just like get it through but if you have if you want to know more about this stuff then check out the youtube video we posted last week i just posted it in chat and uh bob's your uncle
