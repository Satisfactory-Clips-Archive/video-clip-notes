### Transcript

> cool we're at the next segment which I'm going to update the agenda before I forget very cool we're gonna talk about the game what game you might be asking yourself it's the game satisfactory we work on the game since so yeah the state of Dave exactly, so what's going on in the world of coffee stain a lot of stuff is going on actually a lot of very interesting things and I can't wait to talk about it which I'm about to do now oh boy here he comes you all ready I don't have anything new to give I don't have any new information, we will have some information at the end of the week though I guess is is the state of Dev that I'm giving to you all there now all right that's the end of the stream bye no but, we have some, interesting news coming up this end of this week we're sort of, Gathering a bunch of stuff, that we want to share with you all we're gonna share some news about you know what you can sort of expect from us for the remainder of the year, for when update seven is coming out, and, give an update on you know what's what we're working on overall because I think, one thing that- I think I need to convey or I think is important to convey is that we're working on many different things right now and we're working kind of working on more different things now than we were when we were working on update six as well because if you remember we are not doing like, updates the same way as we used to do them we used to do like these package updates where we we you know put together a bunch of stuff we all work collectively to make like a really awesome update package it together and you know give it to y'all and you play it and then oh cool fun times cool, now we've sort of shifted Focus towards working on 1.0 which means that all the development choices we're making are based like have that in mind first and foremost, so which means that we've been working on things in parallel so while some people are working on content for 1.0 some people have been working on content that goes into the the live branches that we have the experimental branch and whatever goes out in Early Access things that we sort of want to get out there and test, put in the wild before you know we we wrap it up so that was including update six and then now update seven we've actually had an extensive sort of discussion internally whether we should call it update seven which we had for update six as well because it's going to be a small update it's going to be an even smaller update than update six probably and, we're still sort of like figuring out what goes into it I know that I said before that we might put the creature changes that we want to do for update 6 and update seven we might not do that for Update 7 because of a couple of reasons, so things are kind of like fluctuating back and forth a lot and, hopefully by the end of the week we can sort of give like a better like no this is this is what it's going to be ish kinda it's some to some degree at least 6.9 no no that's not how this is the the hill I will die on that's not how a semantic versioning Works y'all it would be 6.2 okay if anything no but it will probably be a 0.7 we think we'll see, but, yeah it's gonna be the shortest state of death ever because that's that's sort of what's going on, in in terms of that I wish I had more well- I mean I kind of have more but we need to sort of cement it down before we actually convey this information to you all and then we can talk about it more next week maybe there was a 6.1 yes 6.1 was the Early Access release, when we added the the Foundation stuff yes it's like it's like, what is it major minor build I can't remember what the fourth one is but I think we shifted because we're in Early Access and it makes more sense for us to see it as like like we have major minor and then we have minor minor whatever it doesn't make any sense doesn't have to be major minor patch yeah patch and then build is the fourth one which you don't always include and everyone does a little bit differently, but since we're in Early Access we had to you know make it make sense for us too so yes so yeah that's that's the state of things at the moment so you will we will give you all a bigger update at the end of the week and, Bob's your uncle essentially
