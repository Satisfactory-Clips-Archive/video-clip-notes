### Transcript

> whatever uh what happens if two trains enter at the same time uh they don't uh one will i like i don't know if it if it's it's very unlikely that two trains will on the exact same frame like get to a signal right and then and then it is but but but it can happen right but uh it is possible to do it but what happens in that case uh so in the in the crash that i've set up in the in the teaser video that's exactly what happened two trains have entered the same block uh oh i but i'm manually driving one of the trains into the block so i'm cheating a little bit but it is because if you can like manually drive past signals you you won't like you're still you still have full control and you're mentally driving so you could drive past a block that's saying like no it's occupied and then jump out and then let autopilot take over right uh if you do that you're on your own okay yeah but that's essentially what i did for that shot is that i'm driving past the block manual on the train so that they're both on the same one but automation but automation wise it's probably not going to happen then like i guess they would one of them would take priority over the other and then yeah block off i mean there might be cases where we haven't there might be some edge case here and there or something that maybe makes this happen but that's not intentional that's something that we are going to fix in that case
