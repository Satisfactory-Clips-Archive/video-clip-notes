### Transcript

> a long question I remember a while back it talked about possibly switching to having a game mode where you would have items per minute requirements out of space elevators, Etc instead of needing yes so like a different way to progress the the faces, all those like ideas we have for different game modes they're in like a big document right now and we're sort of like filtering out like what can we do what makes sense to do, and, we'll sort of prioritize those, as development goes on but at the moment I don't know what we've decided like which like the only thing I know is creative mode is gonna come to the game at some point but other than that I don't know what we've like decided to commit on when it comes to game modes, so we'll have to wait and see
