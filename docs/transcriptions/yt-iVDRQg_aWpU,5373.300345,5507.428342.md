### Transcript

> so yeah good times that's happening today as well i believe they will release together with update 5 uh in less than an hour 20 no sorry less than 30 minutes 25 minutes getting there nearly there nearly there uh snoot and jace are you coders well we used to be programmers on such a satisfactory but we don't do that anymore but uh we've both been programmers for quite a while before that in various places it's too bad so if you're just joining us by the way we're counting down counting down to a countdown in 25 minutes we're gonna release update five on early access branch so everyone can access that and we're also gonna reveal the trailer that folks have been working really hard on it's so much work doing the trailers holy [ __ ] and it's really juicy um so we're gonna watch the trailer together and then and then bam everything's coming out but right now we're just chilling with you all for a little bit hanging out yes asking answering some questions answering some questions ask right questions um hope you're looking forward to it uh are you planning controller support uh we'll have to sort of see how that goes um i think we plan on doing some level of controller support at least make things easy for people to remap things i think that might be in the the plans but really don't know when that's gonna be just yet yes will there be mod support for dedicated service that's such a good question because i i don't really see any issue why mods wouldn't work on dedicated servers um i guess the modders need to get the loader hooked up with the build or something maybe um
