> well the vehicle bouncing on the foundation be fixed at some point and sometimes it's like suddenly hit a wall and stops and it's like, is that fixed it's like a collision issue with like all the foundations being separate blocks I believe we're going to be doing a pass on the vehicles at some point from what I understand and some of those issues might go away when we do that right cool I think because there's also we've also wanted to do a pass on like the foundation the way the foundation collision works where like when you're building menu foundations they will like get collected up into one single block instead of having like you know if you have a thousand financial pieces there's a thousand collision blocks separately placed in the world we've talked about making systems to to fix that and that would also sort of solve that issue I think to a certain degree at least
