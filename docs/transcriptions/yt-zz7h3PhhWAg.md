> uh any plan on making crash pods be destruct deconstructable after the hard drive is retrieved no i don't think there's any plans for that i haven't really talked about that is there a need for that like if this sounds like another thing if there's a good reason for that to be doable i recommend a qa site one thing that i could immediately find that could be useful is then it would stop beeping on your scanner right i find that a little frustrating that like you know i'll get beeps on my scanner for hard drives right or well for crash sites and it would be a crash site that i've already been to you know i mark them with beacons and stuff like that but maybe that's something like i would like the beeping to stop and if that means you know dismantling the uh the crash pods that could be one potential solution but i don't know what the designers think of this
