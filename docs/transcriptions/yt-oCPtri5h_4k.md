### Transcript

> how many let's see how much of coffee centers work on satisfactory versus other games is there any cross communication between dev's work integrity so coffee stain studios where me and jay's work where our studio is working 100 on satisfactory we're not working on anything else, coffee stain group which owns coffee stain studios which is a little bit confusing is you know they manage multiple studios so we're also managing lava potion and, and north north and etcetera and publishing yes and publishing as well so like there's there's you know other studios are working on other games but we within coffee stain studios we're working on satisfactory solely, but that's not to say there's no cross communication between us and the other studios, but like lava potion uses unity so we can't really like we can only talk about you know general game dev stuff and like your feedback in that sense we can't like share code because it won't compile, but we've had we've had a couple of situations where we've, shared you know code and talked about problems that we have in our games and you know a couple shots so it does happen but it's not it's it's not super common or regular i'd say yeah iron gate and valheim so they're not part of coffee stain they're just published by copy stain publishing which is different to us like like we are part of the company and and lava potion is part of of coffee stain coffee stain north are is also a coffee stain, studio but iron gate is not actually a coffee stain studio they're their own thing they kind of do their stuff but they work with coffee stain publishing it's the same with like the deep rock folks that go ship they're not actually a cubs in studio
