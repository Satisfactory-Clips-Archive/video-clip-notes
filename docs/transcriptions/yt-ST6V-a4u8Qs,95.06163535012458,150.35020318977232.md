### Transcript

> sounds like yeah dude so my rash has just been flaring up again it started out like Madagascar it's more like grease you should get that check though that's a bloodthirsty killer that is you're right but it doesn't have to be this way because in update seven we're introducing game modes right I forgot so people have been asking for game modes such as creative mode peaceful mode and even hardcore mode since day one and we're glad to be introducing game modes in update 7. however we are not adding everything right away for the moment we're only introducing game mode settings that affect the hostility of the local fauna AKA peaceful mode you can set them to be completely passive or to only retaliate when attacked first or planning to add more GameWorks in the future but in the meantime I better set think to passive I really hope that guy being attacked is okay whoever they were they'll be fine
