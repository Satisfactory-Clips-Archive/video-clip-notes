### Transcript

> or something like that and i guess something that i one thing that i also need to bring up that i already seen a bunch of people point out here is the question about mods because mods haven't worked on the experimental branch since the the engine upgrade if you remember because the ending upgrade really changes how like mods inject into the game and how they load and handle like the things that we have in the game so they can mod up on that so that's been broken on experimental branch up until this point and it's been broken for for several reasons, but i'm not gonna bore you with the details but yesterday or like this tonight at least for me like 10 hours or so, from now the modders just released a version internally for them to be able to support update for and i believe the, the, mod loader has been updated as well so it will give you like a warning or something like that like i mentioned before we don't have official mod support but they've been working their ass off and we've been trying to help them out as much as we can to be able to support that so mods aren't going to work today i believe or maybe i'm wrong about that i'm not i'm not an expert on that check out the modding discord i have there's maybe something like whatever, mods work cool so so mod should work to some degree but it's also up to some of the people making mods to to like update their mods to be able to support update for but i believe that's going to be happening, as as the the days go by, and yeah the update rolls
