> another really exciting thing that happened in the community we got a really quick rifle up this table, the very first like speed run correct me if I'm wrong because I'm pretty sure a couple of people were here actually that participated in that but there was a speed run for the entire game a multiplayer speed run with all the four as of now like at full game as of now, where, a couple of p's came together it was led by epiphany who has the like or had I don't know if the current standing is correct anyway but word records for the the first package run, it's still epiphany yeah yeah cool and it's right after him so so can you give me the time for the final because I think it ended up like 57 hours or something like that 54 54 hours okay I don't have it right now I believe it was 54 hours and something, yeah so they they so it's it's four package percent is the category name and basically that means, how long it takes to send up all four packages up the space elevator and so basically which is as of how the game is at the moment it means finishing all packages basically and it was done in 47 54 hours 7 minutes and 13 seconds right yes very cool that's so fast it's amazing, and that was done on like a dedicated server including like random issues that happened during the run- I heard that he said that like at some point ram ran out on the dedicated server so it just shut down so he needed to like pay for more and stuff like that and they were a sleuth of bugs and random stalls and like crashes and good time because they still managed to get it down to 57 yep which is insane 54. 54. damn it I keep yeah and, I mean you know if you're the first person and only person to do that or it wasn't just one person there were many people who helped out you all share the, the world record then yeah so link to video I don't know if there is a video available I know that, we can link to his twitch and in their twitch, past broadcast they have a lot of it but you know what when I checked their passport costs I didn't see the end of it I didn't see like yeah which sucks so I didn't I couldn't see the actual final timer but, this is their twitch twitch.tv slash epiphany
