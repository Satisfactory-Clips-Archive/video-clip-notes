> note that we're not using linear color space in the game when you're putting them in they're in, what's it called the other one, non-linear, whatever so that's that's why sometimes when people do hex values into, srgb thank you marv, please note that that you need to do a conversion if you do hex to, to the game just fyi i just heard something new yeah next up we have from fallout university we're gonna change that at some point by the way it's not going to be srgb in the game it's just the default values you you when you're making tools in unreal engine or ui it's the j it's the default color space, but it's not like it's it's not readable whatever anyway
