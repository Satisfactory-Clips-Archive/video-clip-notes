> second body slot on update six maybe I talked about in the video how we have plans to have multiple body slots, in the game and- I said in the video that like we're not sure if that will make it for update six, or not it's still not 100 certain that that will be the case but we are working on that so that's that's the thing that's going to be in addition to the game at some point, the main problem we're having is that stuff is unbalanced for that so like having the jetpack and like the the the blade runners at the same time you know like we knew it it kind of overpowered, and it kind of like ruins a lot of the the level design that we have, so that's what we're working on we're trying to figure that out we're trying to balance the systems to work with that, but we are working on that so that that is the thing that's going to happen whether we happen for update six or not we don't know and by the way there might be a lot of cases where in during experimental because this time around when we launched when we released the games rental we might might not release the game to experimental like complete so to speak like feature complete as to what we think update six will contain so there might be this time around like more things like more features dropping while the game is in experimental states

> and it is possible that like you know that be one that might be one of the things where like we launch without multiple hover, multiple body slots and then maybe you'll see that during experimental, I don't know there might be a few things like that that we add, because there's also like, you know when we do releases that's also a good window for us to do bug fixing and like quality of life features you know stuff that also people at coffee stain want to do with the game, because the main reason why we're not like constantly bug fixing is because doing really like doing builds is very tedious and it it's it's a process that stalls everyone so we don't want to keep doing that all the time because then we wouldn't be able to develop the game, so you know while we're in experimental we're going to be able to take advantage of the fact that we're an experimental and that we're making builds so we can you know do do do some bug faces here and there, as for like which ones we'll do I don't know, it kind of has to tie into like what we're working on at the moment, I think I don't want to shoot myself on the foot here but I think we've actually been able to take a look at not all but like some of the pipe issues, that been on our drawing board for a long time, I don't know if that actually will make it into update six but we've had we've like done some work it it it also goes into like the you know we have different branches and sometimes we can't merge if you're working on a specific feature and the fix was made there if we can't merge just to fix over to the development branch then we can't do it until we actually merge the feature, but there's a few things like that that, that we've been trying to get out and hopefully that will get it out but we don't know for certain like what things will come, and I know that a lot of people always like why aren't you fixing this like this bug has been the game for so long the the the it's not the fact that we don't know about all these things it's more the fact that like we sort of have to the the fix has to come in line with development of the game, there's a bunch of things where for instance the, no wait that's not a good example, whatever but like there's a bunch of stuff where like it doesn't make sense for us to dive into and and fix a bug and if it's tied to a system we need to do an overhaul anyways because then we're making a fix for something and then like half a year later that fix is just gone because we needed to rework the system anyways and that bug would have been fixed in the new system anyways so like we wasted time essentially fixing a bug like spending a week on fixing a bug that we would solve anyways when we made the system you know that's that's kind of wasted time for us so that's that's why there's a lot of bugs for instance the, the gas mask in the vehicle thing you know that's the thing that's been in the game for a long time and that was because we didn't we didn't figure out a good like easy solution, to fix that because it's tied into the acquisition system and it's tied into the vehicle system and like we know that we're gonna revamp both of those systems so that being said like this, say system one more time, so that's why like some of these bugs tend to, take longer than others the only exception is the god damn lights not working in vehicles there's no excuse for that [ __ ] bug we fixed that bug so many times I don't I fixed that bug twice personally and we fixed it again for update five and it still didn't work fully so what the [ __ ] anyways so yeah that's funny sometimes it'd be like that, I babbled for a long time did we get any new questions that's what you use mark 5 belt and jetpack for that's true
