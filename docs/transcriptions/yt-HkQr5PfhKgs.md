> so, anything else with state of dev that's what I'm trying to remember- I no I don't think so like we're yeah we're working I don't know what to say like yeah trying to think yeah I mean there's a lot going on, it's kind of hard to summarize yeah, one one thing that I can talk like bring up speaking of merch because wait did somebody mention merch, we have our fan forge running right now, as well for if you want to submit your own designs for merch if you think that we up when we designed merch or if you oh you're lame you should do this instead or if you have any better ideas than what we did make sure to, submit your own designs to our fan forge that's running right now so we have kind of like a competition or challenge running right now, with the initial, face of, the fan forge the fan forge is like a community driven merch development area so we will be picking our favorites and then you'll have the chance to win like a signed some signed goodies from the dev team and some swag a secret goodie bag if you will and some buckaroonies to to purchase some whatever you want from fan forge and that competition is running up until october 8th so this this still time y'all to get in on that all right I'm done with my plug

> no we actually don't make I think anything from the sales, like we we keep our pro like coffee stains profit is down as much as possible so that the, the cost of like the merch is gonna be as low as possible so the merch isn't really something- I've seen so many comments on about like oh what a why aren't conversating releasing coffee staining why are conversating god dammit why aren't coffee stain, releasing the update instead of like trying to make money with merch like we're not making money with merch merch such a frustrating comment it really is like a kind of like a fan service thing, yeah exactly it's because people asked for it so we're making it also we the people making the game don't make the merch so like it doesn't matter that's that's kind of why we we've bundled up with four fans by fans so that they can take care of of that part so to speak and that's also kind of why we have like why we chose them because we have the fanforce thing and like our community are insanely like creative so we know that give them like the option to to to bring something to the table and they will and by the way also all those, designs that the fan designs that are sold on fan forge they do earn commissions on that so it's not like we're just taking someone's design people are like the designer will make commission out of those sales so I always forget to say that I forgot to edit it in the video for some reason I don't understand why I had it in the script yeah oh yeah
