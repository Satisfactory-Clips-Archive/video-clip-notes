### Transcript

> you may have answered his past and he plans for separating the build hologram for the pioneer camera except, except for letting us move the hologram with movement keys while walking around it that's actually not a question that we get a lot, I we've had this question a long time ago but, we have I remember when I started working office and we actually started looking into this and we decided not to do it because it was weird, like, subnautica kinda does this where like you're placing your first place in the hologram in the world and then you're like building it it's like a two-stepper I think, I think the main reason we didn't like it was because it felt like an extra step and you know if you're watching people that stream the game and they're really quick and and build when you're building stuff and like you're just connecting stuff and you want to go fast and stuff like that I think it hindered that and we like even have it as a second mode maybe in the future but it wasn't something that we felt like we should prioritize at that time and given how things are going right now I think there's also other things that we would rather prioritize than starting diving into this again, and evaluating this but it was like you know it solves some problems but also creates some problems so it was sort of lukewarm at best whether we wanted to dive into it more so yeah
