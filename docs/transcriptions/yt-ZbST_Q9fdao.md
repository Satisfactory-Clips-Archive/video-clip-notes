### Transcript

> polish that um how about hovercraft yes have a pack um and was pretty straightforward actually because we we needed to have a version of the jetpack that has a helicopter-like movement um so and we needed to figure out does it use up fuel or does it use up maybe batteries or is it connected to some power grid um so that was part of the ideas like if you see like the first three one three idea sketches we're not just visually different uh exploring different directions but also like the one on the right has like these big battery packs uh in there so it wasn't clear at that point does it have fuel does it use batteries or whatever uh in the end of course we settled for being close to your power lines and it has wireless power connections to those so um visually we agreed on kind of a mixture of all the different elements yeah um you can see a lot of all the designs in the last one yeah it's like the mid part of the butterfly thing the the the charging the the battery is in the middle and then you have still have the wings and of course the rotor blades so it's it's it became a mixture of a helicopter and of course there's some uh terminator hunter killer thing in there too because they're awesome i guess there's a little bit of like marriage between gameplay and and art style here as well where like because i correct me if i'm wrong but the decision to have it be driven by like nearby power is is very mandated by the gameplay because we didn't want the hover pack to be your exploration tool so to speak like it's supposed to be there when you're building absolutely it was definitely a requirement by game design we need to uh we need to tie the player somehow to building in a factory with it and not just otherwise it would have been a flying cheat seriously because i know a lot of people probably will see the the third one with the batteries and be like oh that's something that we've wanted for like coming soon we're coming in that's something day five yeah well that's something that we maybe maybe not yeah we'll see probably not though yeah probably not uh yeah and yeah part of the the controls were of course we wondered how do we how do you control this thing and then we wanted it to be uh p bb partly like a game controller like an old school game controller because a lot of the fixed equipment is very chunky and sturdy uh like when you look at these construction work great phones that have like these solid big cases around it we wanted to be like that but also looked into vr controllers how they work and how uh and there there was actually we thought about how you would actually control it like going up down sideways strafe and um thrust with that thing like like creating thrust going forward and backward and stuff so um this is yeah there was a lot more thought put into than theoretically necessary but practically uh it's helped it make a little bit more sense nice i can't wait for the the steam controller skinning using this oh yeah remember the name of those that's interesting but yeah there's the index uh the steaming that's the one i was thinking of yes i thought you meant the actual controller and i was like it's just called scene controller no no no the vr1 index
