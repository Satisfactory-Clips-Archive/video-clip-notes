> I got a question if we're going to implement direct storage into satisfactory we could all go big bills so it doesn't quite work that way, a lot of a lot of, there's a lot more to it, than just that, to explain it is short in a short format, one of the actual like the biggest issue with satisfactory isn't necessarily the rendering the biggest like culprit is is ram, sorry is is cpu time you're your the factory tick and also the like culling that is happening on the cpu part because a lot of like a lot of processing power goes into when we're doing calling in in general in the game as in calling is when you decide like what should be rendered and what shouldn't be rendered so theoretically if you have like a big wall in front of something then there's no point in trying to send like render data to the gpu right to to tell it to like render the thing but I'm going to render something in in the foreground so you won't see it anyways, but the thing is when you have a lot of buildings or a lot of things on that list of like potential calling then sometimes the the going through the calling can take more time than if you just rendered everything and then you lost frame together so, yeah and and for some people we have a setting for that too in the game where sometimes people get a improvement because their dpu can just render it better, even though it's rendering more things that it needs to instead of doing that whole shebang, it's a setting for that somewhere in the settings so so yeah short short answer it's not that simple
