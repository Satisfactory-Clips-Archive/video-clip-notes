> just saw the moon for the first time can I go there no so it's it's funny too because there's been so much discussion now because I don't think they actually are moons I think they're planets, but they're not realistic like being shiny and I mean personally I'm enjoying the the the recourse of this and people like it's not realistic it's unplayable dude I saw the one reddit post about how like how can the how can the the cracked planet appear behind the gas giant that's impossible, and like the lighting isn't correct with the with the the rings on the on the gas giant either and like how it doesn't make any sense and if you're in a binary planet system then you should be able to see both stars at the same time and all that and you know we have we have a we have a simple answer to all those things and that is look guys it just looks cool okay just let us just let us make cool okay it doesn't have to be 100 realistic you're already, I'm doing the like kid in class that's like bouncing up and down the road it's it's like you're already playing a game where you're magically making buildings appear out of thin air with like a gun you're just shooting build like you're shooting buildings to just appear and just work out of nowhere so, just let us have this okay we worked our asses off to make those things it looks cool okay yeah I'll I'll die on that hill yeah boom my immersion through your immersion but, yeah are we on the moon I don't know I don't know I asked this question internally as well trying to get you know some kind of answer trying to figure out what is going on so I asked the question like hey what's going on are those planets are they moons are we on a moon what's going on and the and the and the answer I got was that was it that was the answer I got and I was like good enough for me so so that's just how it goes that's how that's how the goku crumbles but it does look cool like the the skybox looks cool right just let's just appreciate it
