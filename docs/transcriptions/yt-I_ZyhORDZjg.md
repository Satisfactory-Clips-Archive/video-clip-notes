### Transcript

> I saw a question about, dedicated servers I know dedicated server is his own thing but do you have any etam fixes for the constant crashes so dedicated service when no one's playing local crashes Etc so so you're correct a dedicated servers are its own like, track they're kind of being developed in parallel by the regular of all the other update stuff, unfortunately a lot of times a lot of a lot of times when we have updates coming out, like people's time is spent on like fixing things that are kind of like necessary for the updates so and that obviously means that people work on dedicated servers get less time working on dedicated servers which is unfortunate, we have started we we recently kicked off, looking into more doing more dedicated server work but it's kind of the same thing here with like update 8 being like kind of you know some of the people that work on dedicated servers needs their time is needed on stuff that's related to this coming update so like they're kind of blocking the update in certain aspects but we are aware it kind of sucks that we haven't been able to put out an update for dedicated for a long time I guess that's why we put the like experimental Banner or whatever but I don't think that's like a really good excuse of anything really, even though we say like we know that they're broken like we should still can look into it but, it would have been better if we could have got some more work done on it you know over the past but yeah yeah but that is what it is but we definitely hear you and like it's hard to like convey this but we all we feel the same way we feel sort of like we want to put more time into it and you know especially the people that are working on dedicated servers they really feel like I wish I could work more on dedicated servers, sorry sorry I said it is what it is but I was going to continue that's a weird spot to end that is what it is just deal with it no but, no what I'm gonna say like it is what it is that's what happened but we do want to actually improve it going forward and, that is that is the plan and like it's not just you guys saying hey fix it or us saying it we have people internal who who really want improvements to be made to the dedicated service too and we have every intention to do it so, yeah
