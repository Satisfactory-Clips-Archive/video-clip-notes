>, you're planning to implement dlss fsr so, we kind of like don't really see much, like only a certain amount of people have can use the lss, so like there's not much point and like the people that have those graphics card that run that actually supports the lss you already are you already have a good enough graphics card to run most of the game like the most of the issues with the game is really cpu bound, even when they are related to drawing or rendering it's most like I talked before about how like there's a lot of calling logic running on cpu as well for rendering so we have actually investigated a little bit with dlss and there's some pretty major issues with our conveyor belts in the way they're rendered so we would need to kind of change how they work and that's not something that you probably want to do right now but it's, I mean it's never an impossibility that will add support dlss for dealers but right now we don't really know we have investigated a little bit but yeah but it might not be as like, like as good as it may sound it might sound better on paper than it actually is but there might be some performance game for some people I don't know we don't know but we're we investigated a little bit
