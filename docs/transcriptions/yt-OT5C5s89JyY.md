### Transcript

> terrain manipulation is never going to be a thing unfortunately no this there are six things that we're never going to add to satisfactory all right number one terrain modification all right never gonna have proceed like we're never gonna have what's the word a term, terraforming we're never gonna have terraforming we're never gonna have tower defense we are never gonna have what are the other things, golf definitely one of the three six, we're never gonna have procedural generation we're never gonna have wind and wind power and solar power and that's it that those are the six yeah yeah so so, check out our youtube if you wanna know more about that by the way I just listed six things randomly and if you don't know like what the why aren't you adding golf, check out our youtube channel or our youtube video there's a youtube video called six things we're never adding to satisfactory please give that a viewing so we can get that to a bajillion views so, it's essentially if you want to learn more about why, we're not doing these things did I hear we're adding golf on your dreams and obviously there's a bunch of stuff there's a bunch of stuff that probably will never happen either that people are requesting and stuff like that but these six things are things that we've sort of we have defined that no this doesn't make sense for our game and these are things that we for sure know won't make sense in the game at some point a lot of other things you know like with the zooping and you know all the there's a lot bunch of other things that we've always said probably not but you know we can change our minds right and so so there's a bunch of other things that probably will never happen as well those are a bunch of things that we may say now we don't want to do apart from those six, that we might change our minds to so I know like for blueprints is a good example blueprints is something that we sort of always said will probably not happen and it probably won't happen but we don't want to shut the door on that either, maybe there's like a way to to make it make sense with blueprints in our game, we'll see I don't know at the moment though I don't I don't think so sorry guys but we also said we weren't gonna add pipes but that was a meme okay that's a different thing right
