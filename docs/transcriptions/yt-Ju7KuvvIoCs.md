### Transcript

> so yeah welcome everybody to our weekly dev stream where we talk about the game satisfactory that we're making well we are making it believe it or not even though we haven't really given any news as to what's what's going on with the game recently in the past few weeks yes and and it's going to stay like that actually yeah it's, we still don't really know exactly what's happening, things are happening though especially on the planning front, but there's not at this stage there's not like a super super clear direction on exactly what we're working on just yet but we have some really good ideas and we just want to make sure that we get the planning right before we do stuff so at the moment folks just kind of doing random things

>, and then the folks involved with planning are doing planning yeah because there's no point in us committing to something even by our standards before we know what we're committing to sort of and how we want to yeah yeah stuff like that so, no big news yet but just rest assured that there are things happening there are games things being developed in the back end, and, will update six of dave dlc how do they know cut the feed, so yeah, but but something something that we we did put out last week was we did put out a video last week on our little youtube channel saying what's not gonna be in the game, which you know you know isn't i don't think if you've been, if you've been to the stream before and you've been to the especially specifically the qa section, you probably already knew most of these things, but we felt like it was good to also get that information out there and kind of like put our put a little bit more effort into re like explaining our reasoning behind it usually it's it's us like offhandedly explaining you know from mark or from other people on the team like what the reasons are and i guess technically it's still the case with the video but we did a little bit more research this time around, and got like more you know up-to-date answers from mark and stuff like that, so if you haven't checked out the video, i'm gonna post a link oh okay jason's gonna put link my body is ready professional, where we're just gonna really quickly summarize, the the six things that we bring up in this video which are based events factory maintenance survival elements green energy terraforming and unfortunately golf, so those are the six things you know there there's probably you know more things that most likely won't happen or mo won't make into the game but those are the things that like you know we've been saying for a long time at least and we've been communicating these things probably won't happen because for for a multitude of reasons like base defense for instance a factory maintenance are because that's just not the game you want to make right and and there are still like a lot of other things as i also said in the video that like we don't think we're going to be adding but we want to add and they kind of are in the planning we just don't really know if or when we're going to be able to do them so we didn't include them in that video because we kind of wanted to give ourselves the space to actually still do that to do those things so there's still like you know there's still a lot of things out there that we're not probably gonna be adding but, there's a lot of them, they're just things that we might might add later yeah yeah, yeah i don't know if we need to go through every single thing and reiterate the video if you want to know the videos there yeah the video is there yeah exactly so, check it out if you want to, let's just see yeah and yeah yeah as as always we're probably gonna anyways reiterate these things when we come to the q and a section when we talk about these kind of things, but for the most the the for the most part the reasoning is that it's like not the the features that that we bring up in this video are things that we may or may not feel like it fits the game you know if we could add things like base defense but it doesn't make sense in the game not the ones we make, and some things are just like too hard to balance or make sense in the game or it would change pretty much or doesn't make sense in the way that we design the game etc and, and golf mainly because it's stupid we don't want to do it yeah and it's not lost so yeah yeah and i exactly so that's just how it is yeah, so yeah so, whoa i forgot to update the agenda jeez such a cool whiz gee whiz gosh darn it golly me how how could you it's too busy listening to the weeb music yeah yeah because i want to talk about something kind of cool so we did a little bit of shout out last week, to the speedrunning community, who are going strong and one thing that we're going to do today was going to actually bring on, epiphany which was the way you pronounced it jace was completely correct of course, of course you do have a knack for that though i i have to say figuring out people's, usernames i thought you meant just being right in general no no no no no not that no no don't don't oh no no no no darling don't don't don't don't all right anyway, so we're gonna
>
> [Laughter]
>
> we're gonna do like a little bit of like a mini if you've seen the igns whatever like devs react check out speedrunning whatever blah blah we're gonna kind of do that but we're also gonna bring home epiphany, to do commentating with us, so we can you know ask questions directly because i always feel like when you watch those like game devs react to speed runs they they're just like it's the first time they're seeing it and they're just like what i don't know what's going on, and i feel like you're kind of missing out on like a big portion of the speedrunning aspect of it, because i i both me and jace are super into like speedrunning like you used to you don't run portal i think you have time still on there yeah yeah yeah i used to run a portal and i used to do super metroid i don't think i have any submitted times anymore because when i back in my day it was called speedrunning archive and i don't think that site exists anymore it might still but it's kind of different but the speedrun.com i feel like is the one that's most often used yeah from what i've seen i feel like it's a bit better managed now than it was when i was running, because back then it was like more of a nice thing now it's like actually good organization around everything so yay for that yeah a big part of gdc and stuff like that no wait ag hddq, so yeah we're going to be we're going to be checking out the the world record for for satisfactory one package percent run

> which is done in how it's pretty quick by the way it's like 25 22 22 minutes and i was the sub 23 was it yeah sub 23 yeah so 23 crazy recently, so pretty dope pretty dope yeah i was gonna say i forgot anyway, yeah yeah i guess that's that that's that is anything else with no we we cross it off jace currently has 242nd place in portal one glitchless at once upon a time i was back when i was running i was seventh so, that that category has been optimized since yeah i also don't like that because i've been checking out i still like am super in tune with metroid speed learning and i've been checking out like racists and stuff because i think that's the most like fun part of speedrunning honestly, and a lot of strats that i've learned are like referred to as boomer strats now oh funny so like because they figured out better routings and stuff like that and i just like yeah it's not that long ago since i ran the game but it was, but so i'm looking super forward to that and i know that some people are like you know when you when you mention like speedrunning and satisfactory it's not necessarily the first thing game you think of like i i definitely feel that there are games that are more attuned for speedrunning than others, but you know the the thing about speedrunning is like the big part of speedrunning isn't necessarily about you know glitches or or stuff like it a lot of the movement is really the big portion of speedrunning and when when i've watched these runs for satisfactory you can definitely tell that like there's there's a lot of skill when it comes to like the movement and the organization skills and the menu managing it's a lot of menu manager yeah yeah and like a game like satisfactory i feel like is quite open compared to many other games and so finding like the optimal route is something that would be really challenging as well i feel like yeah, since you have so many options and when you have so many options it actually makes it really hard to find the optimal, path so i imagine like a lot of work has gone into that yeah i mean for sure that's that's the that's the other big portion of speedrunning is the the like yeah the the research or whatever of of of, routing and optimizing the runs etc, and yeah looking at the run it definitely feels like there's a lot of thought into this, so yeah looking forward to that as hell
