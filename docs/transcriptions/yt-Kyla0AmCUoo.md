### Transcript

> let's go let's go let's go gamers so my factory one thing else I maybe need to point out so I'm doing something that's called a sandwich layer in my factory where I have all the conveyor belts running underneath my factory which makes it like a little bit cleaner hoping ham sandwiches down here exactly, so so that's why you see like stuff popping up which makes it a little bit harder to see like where what is going, but as you can see here like if I run up here you can see like I'm I'm making just a classic like making rods over here making plates over here that all go to that those containers then over here I'm making plates and screws that then go underneath the ground up here to make reinforced plates you can see over there, and now we're gonna make modular frames and I'm gonna do this like on the top layer just to make it clear like what's going on so we're not going to use the the sandwich layer and I've already prepared this actually so there's an ore way in the distance and it's making 120, iron ore per minute and we're just gonna like move this up here great oh no I wonder how much time is gonna be spent on just like straightening it out stuff
