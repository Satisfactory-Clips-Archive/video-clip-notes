> too fast I can't read like this so so one question I've gotten actually a lot is mark six belts what's the what's the state with that oh that was actually a talking point that I had when it came to the balancing because a bunch of issues that we currently have and that we're dealing with, I think I mentioned that we're like kind of looking towards that future balance so that certain things might feel currently out of place because they're actually made with like future implementation of certain things in mind like the fact that we have might have more nitrogen the mk6 build is actually part of that because it will greatly improve the amount of, raw resources that you can get per minute because you're currently you're limited, when extracting from pure nodes with mk3 miners fully overclocked you cannot get the max amount of resources exactly, yeah I mean from my perspective this is still planning and I think we have solutions for the main problem that I've always heard was that it's just too fast yeah because isn't there like there's I think there's a technical thing as well where precision is kind of lost on the faster belts as well right now so we need to fix that system if we're going to support faster belts yeah and I think but- I think I was told that it's it's also just, showing them visually or something or being able to I don't remember because there was a solution where if we just made the belts basically a pipe so you can't actually see the items it would it would be fine so you do like a little thing over it like a protective casing, and you say like yeah they're in there there's so many items underneath that casing but they wouldn't be there but that would allow for the speed apparently because I've also asked like can we just have two outputs down on the miner but apparently that's actually more expensive than just having one belt really with it at least if I remember correctly that's what I was told when I yeah I know asking for that oh I didn't think of that yeah that's true actually it up you probably know more about that than I do the complications yeah there's like, there's it's twofold because it also it has one to do with threading we won't be able to thread the same like it's already an issue kind of on the the boxes storage containers, because they also have two input outputs, yeah we don't need to talk too much about that but yeah that's a good point we could have just story say that like it's it's a vacuum tube and it's shooting items in the vacuum or something like that and that's why it's like a quantum conveyor yeah exactly, except to start at the end at the same time
