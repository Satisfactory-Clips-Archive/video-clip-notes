> in the news on eu store and the cup I don't think we have any updates, no no no updates, I mean the update that I think I gave last week or the week before I think it was last week I said a year before, was that we yeah so so we plan on the the mug we have plans on when that can come out might be in the next few months sometime and when that comes out we will probably also have an eu store come out with with it so that you'll be able to get the mug on the e store as for what other products will be available on the eu store I don't know if it's just going to be the mug or some of the other new stuff or if all the products will be there I'm not sure but I'm pretty sure that there will be an eu store for when the mug comes out and that looks like it's going to be in the next few months or something oh that's so that's, that's all I know on that
