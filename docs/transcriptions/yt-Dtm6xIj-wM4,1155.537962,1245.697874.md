### Transcript

> to save maps I heard from Marcus our other programmer say that it took you guys six months to get it working yeah so we're we're basing our seyh system on the way you save in Unreal Engine yeah the way we're using Unreal Engine if if that wasn't clear so in a real engine it's it's like it's there's a system for how you save a normal engine and we're using the same system whereas you mark stuff on properties on actors and stuff like that and then we extend it by having support for there's a lot of like complex saving on certain things and we wanted to have like support for to be able to like load any save whenever and be able to support that like no matter how much we update the engine and stuff like that should always be able to like load the saves that being said there are a few cases where we change game design a lot which can may happen where you might get stuck if you start loading old safes but yeah there's a lot of work that went into making the safe system work which I important it wasn't too involved in so I don't know that that Pacific's specifics but yeah the the amount of time we spent on it is just because we want it to be very very sturdy so that and it's it's not been acting up a lot or at all almost yeah it's been pretty pretty good
