> so some folks someone's saying like any idea if there's lag on gpu and cpus I mean at 50 another person saying is the new engine more heavy my game got worse fps after the upgrade I think something that you could do is consider sending out a save file, you can contact us on discord or something like that yeah consider it consider doing that if you have something really weird like that going on you can contact us and we'll see if we we should have you send a save file and maybe we can look at it maybe we can't it depends on how many messages we get and it depends on how busy the dev team is that sometimes save files can be, helpful for us, figuring out problem areas, when it comes to optimization so, like I remember last week there was someone who's got like a fully decked out pc and had was running 15 fps, which clearly there's something wrong and maybe their save file can help us figure that out yeah ben noticed that, there was something with rendering conveyor belts so like I sent him my save file and then he did something magical and then I got like a way better performance after that yeah, so there are like some known things with conveyor belts specifically rendering wise that's pretty heavy, and hopefully we will have those fixed before update four, for the most part and and we don't need like if you have like some frame fps issues that doesn't mean send us your save file like if you've got like a you know mid to high to your pc and you've got hundreds of hours on your save file and you're in the middle of the busy factory you're going to have lower fps for sure but if you if you cannot explain why the fps is low like if there's something really weird going on definitely contact us yes
