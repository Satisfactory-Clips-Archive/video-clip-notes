> screws and plates are being turned into
> reinforced iron plates but maybe we
> don't want all of them to go with that
> maybe we want to store some of them that
> so that we can use it later we can come
> and take it out of storage and build
> some conveyor belts or something we may
> not want all of them to be converted so
> if that's the case let's yeah let's
> build a couple more storage containers
> here storage container and one thing to
> note here is you can see that there's
> one input in one output and the orange
> form with the arrows pointing in that's
> obviously the input and then the aqua
> turquoise one pointing out is the output
> so I'm going to build a storage in here
> I'm gonna build one ring here it's gonna
> get a little tight though let's build
> one somewhere else look this one here
> this is beautiful by the way and we can
> also build on top so let's do that so
> now we have the storage containers for
> what I want to store let's try and get
> them over there so something else that I
> want to demonstrate are these can vary a
> poll multi like multi-level conveyor
> poles basically so what I'm gonna do
> yeah I want to demonstrate these so what
> I'm gonna do is I'm gonna set this to
> number five on my health bar and then
> I'm gonna create some splitters so I'm
> gonna split the iron rods and I'm gonna
> split the plates and I'm gonna build a
> multi canary Pole thing here and then I
> guess I'll do one here
> and I'll do one here hoping you can see
> what I'm planning and then I'll put this
> last one like here maybe okay and now I
> can start we'll just flip that into here
> we just whip this one into here now
> we've got this little cool little system
> going on and in fact I think I'm
> foreseeing a problem here because I also
> need to split I also need to split here
> but not just that this is gonna be kind
> of tricky for this conveyor belt to get
> through I guess it does work there but
> one thing that might even be safer is if
> I were to dismantle these and I get the
> plates that were on them there once
> instead of keeping on the same level I
> might take the bottom level put it to
> the middle take the middle level put it
> to the top and now it's much safer in
> terms of clearance of getting over this
> conveyor belt so there's no issue there
> and yeah they clear that quite easily
> and then I can grab the screws and I can
> plug that into here and now we have our
> three resources and yeah so then what we
> could probably do just for demonstration
> purposes I'm just gonna do another thing
> here so you can see you can set up all
> three of your layers and then I'm gonna
> just send the screws into here I guess
> and I'm gonna send my I think that with
> plates down here and my rugs okay and so
> now I have my three resources and
> there's ladders on here so I'm gonna
> climb up here now I have my three
> different resources coming into their
> respective storage containers now one
> thing I haven't demonstrators are
> conveyor belt merges which and I'll do
> that now for example these storage
> containers they it's not as if they can
> only hold one type of thing so maybe we
> want to just store all three in one
> storage container personally I wouldn't
> do that
> but let the demonstration purposes we
> can do that okay so now if I make a
> conveyor merger and I hope I give it
> enough space for this we're gonna find
> out I'll do that there we take this to
> come around like that
> this one you come down here
> let's help them please work yep I'm in
> there so now all running out of space so
> all of these are being fed into the
> merger if I grab that stick in here and
> all of those resources should come
> through this we've got screws we got
> plates screws plates rugs freeze rods so
> they're all coming out and they're all
> going into this storage container and
> like I said I personally wouldn't do
> that I'd prefer to have dedicated
> storage containers because essentially
> this is gonna fill up quicker now
> with various things when you could just
> store more across different storage
> containers yeah so that's the merger
> those are the multi-level poles gray
> poles I think that's everything covered
> so now let's see how many reports are in
> place we got two we have 13 this is very
