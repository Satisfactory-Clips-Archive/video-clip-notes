### Transcript

> date another thing that I can tell you about the Alpha is that it will be focused on the early game on onboarding so that's just gonna be about you know when a new player joins how are they introduced to the game can they figure out how to play well you know basic just early game stuff but of course we'll be taking feedback about any bugs or suggestions and stuff like that as well the Alpha will also be in stages so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be focusing on like one starting area of the game and and seeing how that plays in the early game and we're gonna focus on that making it look good and making it feel good and design the flow of the game well we're not locking out other areas of the map so if you want to explore go for it but those are areas that we haven't you know we're not saying they're final or anything like that they're not polished the gameplay there is maybe not perfect we just want to get one starting area right first and then we'll move on to the other ones attacking the Alpha will also be limited so that you've only got like early and I don't know like maybe mid game stuff I don't know the specifics but we don't want you diving too deep into the lake game because again we just want to test early game that's the feedback we really need we don't really need feedback on the late-game stuff now that's not that we don't have it but again we just need what's useful to us right now and also it's gonna give us an opportunity to like keep some of the cool stuff we have in like game behind wraps and we can surprise you a little bit later so I hope that information ties you over for
