### Transcript

> all right let's dive into the nitty and gritty what the f what is going on at coffee stain right now what's happening it's chaos it's absolute chaos yeah we burn down the building, people are running around the building yeah down again we, have fights all all day all along fisticuffs yeah fisticuffs for sure, so we launched the update update seven on experimental last week, and so far it's been pretty good actually, we have like obviously there's been a couple issues but I mean every experimental release has issues and you know we also release the whole point of us releasing an experimental first is because you know we're not fully done with the update when we release it there's a couple of issues on there, most of the issues that are you guys are you guys are really good at reporting these by the way on our QA site questions.satisfactorygame.com, we've been going through most of them we had a couple of issues with our build server last week classic calendar times I've said that on the dev stream but, something was wrong with like the steam upload that didn't work and I think we also waited a little bit on valve to get back to us which kind of hint paused some of the updates a little bit I think we only got one or two patches out last week, one came in on Friday, but but that also meant that like all the patches that we were gonna release during the week kind of like became one big patch instead of us releasing many small patches and I think we've got that resolved now so we're gonna try and get you know patches out more often than we did it's not just going to be like one patch a week, but, yeah we fixed a lot of stuff we're still working on finishing up blueprints there's a couple of known issues specifically tied to multiplayer there's a couple of issues with like tractors and like or sorry, vehicles and collision I think or something like that those are these are known, there's also issues with like conveyor belts not rendering properly, stuff like that like most of these things we're aware of, and if it's on our QA site then we have seen it trust me and we are working on fixing like you know the we we do prioritize like the biggest issues first obviously so like all these like game blockers are are highly prioritized and then it's like crashes and stuff like that so yes and there's yeah so improvements on blueprint snapping as well it's coming, yeah we're just we're just working on on that and and we're gonna try and get a patched out I didn't I haven't seen them talk about it today but usually we try to get a patch out on Tuesdays but, I'm not sure if we'll see one today usually what happens is it was okay usually what happens is it also tells me there's gonna be a patch out today and I'm like cool and then I'm like it's like 9 00 p.m or whatever I'm like okay no patch today and then like at 11 he's like ah pushed it out God damn it, and sometimes there's none but, so we'll see it it's like right now like we're really pushing patches like as soon as we feel like we are confident that the patch you know solves the whatever we set out so that it solves and that it's stable and all that stuff, so it really is like you know as soon as it is possible for us to push a patch we push it we don't wait, because we we find that it's it's more valuable to just get it out in a state in a at least to that what we think is is good solves more stuff than it breaks yeah exactly, and it's it might be frustrating if like we could put a patch and then like suddenly parts of your factory start working or something like that but, you know if you are playing an experimental I guess this is kind of like what we ask that you are aware of that you probably will run into this kind of stuff, and it helps us solve things much quicker yes did I miss anything Jace I think I got everything I don't know I think that's probably it

>, anything else fun going on we we wrapped the patch notes video last week by the way yes it's true it's true so that is in high production right there there will be a update seven patch notes video yes I don't know what I'm gonna look forward to yes I don't know if we confirmed that until now actually no you just did that's not sure if we were going to or not but yeah why not, so people have been asking me if we were going to do another passionless video because they missed it when we didn't do one for update six yeah yeah but, yeah so yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be I'd probably a little shorter, because it's a smaller update but I think it's still pretty fun anyway it was a pretty good time filming it yeah and, it was probably probably the smoothest filming we've had yeah I wonder though it was just it was also smaller yeah I guess yeah like we were actually able to film it all within like a normal work day yeah, but I had fun voice acting yeah it's fun we'll see how it goes cool that's state of Dev question mark yeah I think so, yeah I don't know we're just kind of working on it working towards Early Access version of update seven, and then I think the plan is to do a fixmest in December yes and, and then we take a break and then we come back yes so that's pretty much all I know, I think we thought about maybe doing a video this week just to catch everyone up of the the state of Dev I suppose for update seven but for the YouTube, folks since they're not all here so there might be a video out this week but we're both really really busy this week so it it might be that we can't make it happen yes so we'll see we'll see though but I think people are pretty good at like trickling down sort of what's going on so I mean it seems like the people here in twitch at least yeah yes cool experiencing fixmest for the first time will be fun you haven't been part of the other thing that's gonna be cool yeah yeah no I don't know when well- I think it's going to be the first right what was it okay, well it's that's been in the past at least like I hope I'm not wrong about that, but I think we've always started at like first of December and then it runs until January something so like even if you even if you can't play the game during Christmas if you're like away on break or something there's a little bit of like leeway, after the end of the year, in January so you have a little bit of time kind of gnarly since we're kind of working on, this is where working on, stabilizing update seven yeah could be here yeah we'll see what I know I'll let you know yes fixmest blueprints coming oh yeah oh no there's probably a bunch of stuff we haven't tested for that oh yeah or maybe my family usually plays once a year at the start of fixmest so we get more interesting oh cool that's kind of cool yeah I've only ever played in a Christmasy State that's kind of fun yeah it's a holiday game like it's nothing but a holiday game satisfactory a holiday game yeah it's like you had Die Hard Die Hard yeah I was gonna say like it's like die hard where it's like it's satisfactory Christmas game or like what are you talking about it's not a Christmas game yeah it is a Christmas game you're playing a Christmas game actually you play it during Christmas well that just because you play it during Christmas doesn't make it a Christmas game and so on scene I mean the Holy Trinity of Christmas is Donald Duck try a die try hard die hard and satisfactory yeah nothing gets more Christmas dude- I won't have my Christmas unless I have, what's his name Bruce Willis climbing through a vent while, making a hard, screws yeah let me modular frame yeah heavy monitor frame very nice all right let's jump into the Q a section then if if anyone has any questions that is I mean you never know no it looks like, total [ __ ] try hard God oh Donald Duck is a tryhard yeah yeah but he's Simon here Simon does the best, Donald Duck sounds oh yeah he does holy [ __ ] I forgot about that it's insane
