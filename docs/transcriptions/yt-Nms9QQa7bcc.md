> has a blueprint preview or undo option been looked into more by the dev team, I, I don't really know that's hard to say again we're winding down we're winding down for the year so it's not really the best of times- I know it's been considered but I don't know if any work has been done for it, but again like I know some people have some issues with blueprints and that there's maybe some user experience issues with them I just want you to know that the the team has heard your feedback and does read your feedback and by all means keep giving feedback on the QA side right they they really really do read it like we rely on that so much actually, and there's I there's an incredibly High chance that some some work requiring that stuff is is gonna I mean I can almost just say we're gonna do something about it but like I don't want to say that and then something comes up and we can't do it and then now I'm a liar or something you know that's why I'm being a little careful here because I can't predict the future but, there's a great interest from the team to do more work with blue blueprints yeah
