> there's still a lot of work left to do on update four so like, still quite early to ask when that's gonna happen, our estimates or whatever are that we'll probably launch update 4 sometime around the end of the year, or it might be next year, depending on a few things that we're kind of still deciding upon right now one of these factors is how are we releasing update 4 are we gonna make like a big update like we did with update three and just release it all or are we gonna like, like release bits and pieces of it leading up to it, or are we just gonna roll out like updates like patches more or less, and I think the the I don't know but my what I think was said was that we're gonna say we're essentially gonna have update four be rolled out, later and then have like a few updates to it before it happens so I'm like quality of life stuff not like maybe not new content per se, but like maybe upgrades, to things we already have in the game or quality of life stuff I don't know, and then at either at the end of the year or next year we'll have a big content update and we'll release that like we did with upstate 3.
