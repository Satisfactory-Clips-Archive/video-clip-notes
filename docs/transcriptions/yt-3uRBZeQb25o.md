### Transcript

> I hope you have enough concrete to build more poles I think you need one more pole I think you've got yeah I think you can build two poles yeah so now I hook this up to power which can't run right now, try again and now we have enough power to run just the coal generators we take a look at the grid for a sec just so we can sort of see, so the blue line there is your maximum consumption from buildings production is how much you're making so you're currently making exactly the amount that you at most will use yes, , and then the capacity is how much I can't I'm I can like use be right right, so biomass printers work a little differently right that's why the consumption and production is yes so biomass generators will like produce enough power that's needed whereas coal generators are always like full on full blasts so they will always produce like their maximum amount of power
