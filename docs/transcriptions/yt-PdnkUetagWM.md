### Transcript

> so they're asking now this someone asks uh how many tiers does the team envision to have the game we've previously said eight and that's what we've always said um do you think we may have more do you think there's a chance of that or yeah because the things that we want to cramp into tier 7 and 8 it might be a little bit too little space depending if we want to meet certain requirements so i have been discussing whether or not it should maybe be nine uh don't know yet like we could go for eight we are considering maybe nine as a wrap-up uh wrap-up face yeah you don't get the full two tiers from nine and ten right but you get like kind of tier zero as your onboarding and tier nine is like the finalization of your your project and the story wrap up you gotta go ten out of ten why not why not 10 when i go 14 17. but i i guess another thing with it is like uh i think um a lot of folks would probably lose their at the idea of a tier ix but i think even if we had tier ix that doesn't mean more content necessarily does it or uh i mean the whole reason that we're discussing it as well is because there are certain things that we think might not really fit into tier viii right we would have to move it sorry so you're just offsetting what we would already have uh potentially yeah we would ship some things around or we would add like it is one thing that we kind of want to add but it doesn't fit into tier seven and eight i'm not gonna say necessarily what it is that we want to add but so that might require tier 9. another nice thing is that you will you will unlock a lot of cool 7 tier 7 and 8. and if you only use those things in that same same phase of the game it is maybe kind of limiting how much you can do with it so having that additional tier that mainly would focus probably on just getting more stuff into the space elevator might be nice to really use the full potential of the content that you have in the previous tiers right if that makes sense yeah so yeah it's it's under consideration um i really don't know yet for sure we have to discuss it with more people on the team so wait for any more
