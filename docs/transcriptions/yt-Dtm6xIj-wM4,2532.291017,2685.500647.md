### Transcript

> Jace how do you divide work amongst the various programmers on the team we have I was gonna say why are you looking at me and I'm like wait I'm I'm kind of a special case which is just not doing me any saying that is not doing me any so we have our producers or producer which kind of have a good sense of what's going on overall in the game so they collect feedback from like how are the artists working or what are they artists working on right now with the program is working on right now I like all the different game development prints whatever so they tend to like gather information and talk to our talk to our leads in the various fields so like to talk to our graphics lead and our program lead discuss like what do we need right now what can we do right now what's important for our developers right now so that all trickles down to the programmers where we have daily stand-ups and planning meetings where we discuss like if you want to implement this how hard can be and what are you weren't like and then we get to work and then we talk about what are we working on right now so we have daily stand-ups where we discussed that and then yeah I mentioned the leads have their own meetings in in my case because I do a lot of community management stuff I can be out of touch with the programming that has gone on in the project at large so I tend to take on things that are independent from what other people do so I I have been doing the vehicle since the beginning which is has been a lot of work but but these days like when I was redoing the drifting there's no dependency on any other programmer for me to rework drifting for example so I've been doing a bunch of things like that and there's like we all we're not a lot of people in studio know like it's not a super big studio when you're five or so bit more now we're gonna be about 30 so like no programmer is really like you're only doing that code stuff or you're only doing AI stuff so we're all kind of like split we take we tried to like generalize as much as possible so that everybody can jump in and do stuff to it but obviously like some people have done like specialize and stuff for the game like you've done vehicles yeah I've done a lot of net code
