### Transcript

> so yeah this next next segment is, is, what we're all here for pretty sure so I'm gonna drag hannah into the call now okay don't get don't get alarmed when this happens hannah boop hello can you hear me are you not we'll see yeah hannah highlight for sure weekly quote don't y'all worry that's like the the full on oh wait I had to move back I didn't remember that hello hello oh I need to join the room I'm an idiot hello there you are yeah I was like why can't you hear me- I can't hear anything I'm just sitting here when is it gonna happen yes, one second it's it's, it's it's good you're here because you can save the stream, yeah I've I've seen the disaster happening live you know, so let's see if this works if you're here yay look at that we can see hannah hi hello hello hello, so yeah this is hannah if you've ever if you if you haven't been around before this is hannah hannah is our level designer but also our narrative what do you call it narrative narrative person narrative the designer writer yes yes for the story that no one knows anything about not even people at the office no it's funny because because you we did like, there was like a presentation of like the story and everything but I'm pretty sure like all of that is scrapped and we're doing everything right yep nice so it's gonna be a surprise for everyone once we actually have a story yeah yeah it's going to be a surprise for me what's going to happen with that what we're managing, what we're going to manage essentially from all the ideas that we have, actually that's kind of interesting because like
>
> [Music]
>
> maybe we can just really quickly talk a little bit about like what we're for those that don't know story is supposed to come with like the 1.0 release the reason why we haven't had any story at all so far is because we don't want to like release it in like iterations but also because we don't know like exactly how the story's gonna play out sort of or like how you like experience the story so to speak yeah yeah, so I guess we're kind of like we're currently in the process of like kind of trying it out right or like play testing or yeah kind of figuring what we can still do with the time we have like we don't want to delay stuff for too long either, to sort of you know coordinate with all the rest of the development that's going on it's kind of like story is part of that sort of backline that's always going and isn't really added to any of the updates but it's like continuously being worked on like off and on, and, yeah- I am very curious to see what we what we're gonna manage we have plans of course I'm pretty sure for sure everyone is curious it's gonna happen yeah yeah absolutely yeah, cool so this is hannah like I said before hannah is the the mastermind behind the aspire coasts, that you guys have seen and, we're gonna be talking a lot about the spire coast in this stream today we're gonna to try and address like, some of the things that weren't like clear in the video that I put out last week, but also show you guys more of the sparkles essentially, and, I gave you I sent you a link on team cena with, so you can actually access the slides and control them because we live in the future oh my god yeah that's wild yeah and I'm screen sharing on discord so you can get the live react of it so you'll be able to like flip back back and forth it's usually a lot easier than with your control than if I do so, so yeah we're going to be talking about the sparkles we're going to first talk a little bit of like the the conception of the spire coast and show you guys like a little bit of, stuff exactly going, through basically kind of the process that we went through when we were working on this thing and kind of how it's like to work on a on a biome from you know zero to hundred yeah, so let's see how this works yeah click but did it work yes do you think there it is it's a little bit of a delay for me but it's fine so I figured let's start with, what I started with and that was that, the old spirit coast that all of you still have access to and, as you can see it's just rocks and the whole lot of nothing the canyon was kind of fine but there were some like old deprecated assets and old ideas in there that didn't quite work anymore for us so we had to do some fixes there so I figured let's just include that entire thing with the spiral coast because you know we we fixed up the northern forest really nicely and then, it'd be kind of weird to have like this really old kind of shoddy canyon in between that and then another shiny new biome yeah so yeah, so usually what I started with was completely removing everything, and, we also had some inspirations for the sparrow coast and a lot of this like this is one of the like kind of boards that we we had like, the world team essentially, so a lot of the the things that we were talking about was like okay we have a base of tropical islands we wanted to do something tropical because it's flanked by two deserts it's pretty warm so let's do something warm but fertile, so we were yeah very inspired by kind of, I guess southeast asian, environments a lot island sand bank shallow seas we wanted to add some rocky spires we wanted to keep the sparkles the spider coast, which meant a lot of verticality and then, we wanted to you know do something more cozy with like rock overhangs and bridges and tunnels to sort of have that semi-cave feel to things, and, and then add some like waterfalls and make it just a really fertile like lush place essentially that's kind of what we what we started with, and this is one of the biomes that we kind of landed on universally very quickly so that was really nice so this is essentially like a mood board of all the different yeah exactly just kind of like we don't really do a lot of concept art for our environments at this point we have such a big asset library that we can kind of just work with what we have and if we're missing something then we'll make something new, so yeah and this is kind of like, one of the first things- I did was like create some islands to sort of test out like how the landscaping kind of kind of worked and these are the islands that when you go into the area are like the northernmost like most far out, into the ocean, these ones and then, yeah and then some like some basic cliff stuff like not the spires yet but just some like island cliffs to keep like okay how high do we want to go with these when when it's far out yeah very different like it's it's like the same mood but very different like style of yeah like feel to that area yeah exactly, and here is something that happens when- I make a lot of screenshots, to post progress and sometimes people photobomb these screenshots with their chat messages so here, this one's sponsored by mark, oh it's from the closing meeting that's a while closing meeting yeah this is this is last year somewhere yeah, we used to have, we used to have like a a group of people that like came together from different disciplines and then we had a closing meeting where we just brought up stuff and we stopped doing that a while ago and it's cool to see it in here yeah anyway yeah exactly, and this is kind of the first picture that I have from after I completely erased everything and- I done most of the big like block out overhauls, so I've painted where the islands were, like roughly and I've made a lot of the spires but there's no there's basically almost no foliage except for again the northernmost island islands and those are in like the the left bottom corner, a lot in a lot of the pictures north is south in the picture, because I work like from with the ocean at my back most of the time yeah, and, and the those islands, are basically where I did a lot of my tests so, I also did like, you know you do a kind of a rough block out for all the big stuff and then I did a second pass where I just kind of looked at like oh you know how to to add some more some more spires some smaller spires some more bridges a little bit more like interconnectedness I started adding a whole bunch of arcs as well, because they're cool yeah because they are cool the yard the waterfall there this is the the valhalla, of floating rocks this time truly, yeah there's a lot of like, old like a game dev stuff, still in there so the the rocks the floating rocks there see are the the gas pillars yeah so there's a lot of those that I have to navigate around because they're like they're left from the old area in positions where there used to be like something but there's so there's a lot of floating gameplay elements inspired coast still because we haven't, fixed it yeah fun fact I had to delete those when I was capturing the the shots for the teaser video they were still there yeah yeah no I've also tactically hit on them out of sight out of mind, exactly but here's proof proof that floating rocks are part of the process yeah for sure ah let's see- I've completely forgotten all like the order of the slides oh yeah here you go first foley sketches so this is this is those islands again and this is kind of where I start testing out like oh what kind of foliage like combinations can I make that kind of get the vibe that we wanted to to go with so I sort of it's all still like fairly rough and I just like combine things to see if they work both like shape-wise color-wise placement-wise I just kind of like try out some things, and then the the images that are that are highlighted with orange those are the ones that we picked to develop further so those are the ones that that we like the most, and then we went on to like I went on to detail them and add more like, types of assets to them and that's how when we got this and this was kind of the first like view of what the area truly could look like, so, sponsored also by, our, art director, thorsten who made it a shirt yeah I was gonna say like made with some of the assets I love the little shirt with the little drink at the at the bottom as well yeah yeah that's exactly the vibe that we wanted to to have for this area yeah but so on the on the the left is basically the main set, and that is also like I have a certain amount of foliage assets that I can use and that includes a lot of the the boulders and the gravel, and, I can't I can be around like 15 ish 15 is like when it starts getting dodgy and I need to start to start sort of like reducing, the the amounts of assets so that's about the count that I usually have for my main set and then I also start making some like subsets because I like to have in in biomes as big as this especially like variances between the types of foliage I use in certain areas so you can kind of, understand where you are depending on which assets are used in that place and I'll show more of that later so dodge has in the sense of like too many different types of assets being loaded on the same tile is too much yeah yeah it starts impacting performance yeah so I need to like keep that count
>
> [Music]
>
> okay so it's not just like how many foliage types you place it's also like how many different types you use exactly yeah I'm pretty sure because like all of these pretty sure like all of these assets are like already have already existed in the game before, yeah these are basically using assets from from all like a bunch of other biomes this is this is purely picked from our library and then combined and placed in different ways to sort of you know it's it's a lot of my job is like using at like reusing assets in a smart way so you don't really as a player don't really think about like oh I've seen this before or like you know that that this still giving this biome sort of a unique identity even if I'm using similar assets as other places or just kind of grabbing and taking from other places yeah because I thought that was pretty wild when I was when I saw it the first time was that it felt like there's a lot of new stuff it was only really like the coral reefs that were new yeah there's some new assets or assets that we've kind of tweaked a little bit but most of it is is already used like the blue palm trees are from rocky desert for example yeah, and like the ferns are from northern forest, and there's there's a plant that we use kind of in a lot of places I think western dune forest and also in some of the dune, wayside so it's just like scrounged like from from everywhere we have just a big library of toys essentially for me where I can look at like this one this one this one combine it together does it look good etcetera cool I will show them the new ones a little later all right see a little bit of existing coral reworks speaking of also sponsored by the occasional material bug that makes light shows happen really threw me off for a loop when I was working in the areas like excuse me what the is this yeah you guys have seen it happens there's, the, there's like one plant I'm pretty sure we ship that this bug with one plant, the the cigar kind of looking what are they called, yeah that were they were like glowing exactly like, what is the name for it it's it's it's the it's the always like missing material yeah kind of yeah yeah yeah cat tails yeah yeah yeah that means that that the acid is deprecated and needs to be replaced generally this was a different bug yeah this was a bug essentially that the the pink thing is is, deliberate just, basically, a nice way to tell me by giving me an eyesore that this asset needs to be replaced please don't ship this yeah exactly like obviously there's something wrong here, but yeah I mean it was pretty cool honestly we I think we briefly contemplated like can we do something like this but no no it's too, too intense, but yeah these are some like examples I didn't really have, pictures of the old coral trees but these coral trees have been, remade and then, they're in more places, all over the map you can also see them a bunch in blue crater like the the the disc trees, and, then you have the sort of like, the the rock with some coral island that's the the one new asset basically that we have for this area, because that is the one that we're using underwater, and that's one of the the kind of the beginning of like underwater, work that we're doing right now but hannah I thought we said no underwater I mean visually yes underwater otherwise it's boring as hell like it's it's like an empty ocean with nothing in it it's just depressing like we want to do something it's my life yeah I mean what what's what tells you tropical than a colorful coral reef right yeah I know right yeah, and then, the kind of, like stalky stuff that's like a mess is basically we remade that asset because one we didn't think it looked very good anymore and it had a lot of collision issues and stuff so we made a version that is smaller and we paint more of them and they combine into similar structures so it's not as it's the collision actually works there's no like invisible walls with it anymore and it's more optimized and it looks a little better so yeah, stuff like that like small small tweaks we got really lucky with this biome with how little we needed to add for it and that was kind of the idea too we didn't really want to have too many artwork for this because there's a lot of I mean there's there's so much to do and we didn't want to add to the workload so it just worked out really well sometimes it happens yep and at this point in development we've had years to grow a library of assets right so we're good
>
> [Music]
>
> subnautica confirmed yeah absolutely matt although it is gorgeous like that is such a great example of how to make a good underwater like environment so good, but yeah when I was busy working on the blockout I had this idea, and this is kind of an example of how sometimes you you're going one direction and then suddenly you take a hard left turn into a new idea, and because we have these coral plateaus that we've also used in blue crater and I was like I was trying to figure out a way to add more like nice sort of overhangs to the area and and how to sort of, create more of that sort of cave light feeling and like nice height layering where you actually had a lot of surface up like up higher to to like either walk on or build on whatever you want and I was like maybe I can use these so I try to use the coral plateaus instead because we don't have a lot of good, cliffs that could fill the same role and then I had the idea of like oh I did some tests with it I showed it to some people and you're like what about this area being this sort of old coral reef that that that was exposed essentially like over time so a lot of it is still sort of left like old coral, and it used to be underwater and that's kind of what we settled for at this point so I started, placing all of these plateaus and the nice thing about these plateaus is that they're also great for exploration gameplay lots of platforming that you can do with this so I want to place like, power poles and then just do zip lines between everything make like a yeah yeah yeah you can absolutely do that I like- I kind of like to place them sort of like their their their stairs their steps but like in, with like big distance between but you can like use your jet pack or whatever you want to like hop from one to another and like find your way up like circling around the spire that way and I think it'll be pretty fun for people yeah like that making interesting tree houses yeah yeah I mean I'm excited to see what people are going to build here whether they're going to raise the whole place or or build the environment it's you never it's always going to happen both are going to happen but definitely bias for the ones that use the environment in their builds as well alright okay so once all of the the big stuff is done like the sort of the blockouts with the cliffs and the the blockouts of the landscaping I start placing all the big foliage and with big foliage I mean the coral plateaus all of the the big trees, some of the big other coral pieces like the coral trees and stuff because those are the most impactful it gives me a good idea of what the vista is gonna look like whenever you're standing anywhere and kind of how how lush we're going, and just kind of get an idea of like where all the foliage is gonna be so yeah and that's that's really the moment where an area starts kind of feeling like it's it's alive and there's some there's something happening here at least from from a distance like when the moment you go up close like there's no low growth at all it's just big trees but let's see, yeah and then, after I'd been doing a bunch of this stuff I made the first island essentially and this one is somewhere in the middle and this was kind of taken into account some some some of the new ideas that we had with the foliage and just kind of like when I make the foliage test I make them for only like one perspective just one one just exactly enough to fill sort of the view of the camera with this I wanted to make an actual place that you could walk around in and look different ways and kind of get the feeling of what this area would be like and I it's it's like 80 in the sense that like we don't we don't, build anything up to 100 we build everything up to an 80 because the last 20 is often done by big stuff like lighting and we're gonna you know replace some of the water stuff like a lot of things that that impact the whole area, and aren't really part of the the normal day-to-day work that I do and stuff that generally we aren't able to add until a little bit later because things are still in development, so a lot of a lot of things are considered to be at 80 and 80 is essentially good enough to ship but we can still improve it with things that we're either planning or hoping for, if that makes sense gotcha would you say that like 80 is like where the majority of the other stuff for the planet is at or I mean this I think I think like the the the areas like dune desert northern forest if if you if you kind of add the the state of the sky now and like the environment and the lighting I would say they're at 90 now because we're planning to do some some like global improvements that will get everything up to 100 essentially but yeah, most of it is is very near to completion gotcha I hope I certainly hope so we can always feature cooper a little more yes- I saw somebody, I am alaska I think to talk about how this seems like a lot of work, for one person yes and no, I've been doing this for about five years now and I've definitely gotten a lot faster, and also there's a lot of stuff on the side that I do while I'm working on this area but yeah a lot of it is like it's not necessarily complex work at least in in my experience at this point but it just takes a lot of time because you're placing just a lot of assets like it's a big area this spy coast is about is is nearly as big of a surface as dune desert surprisingly so, it's not it's not definitely not as big as doing desert but it is it is getting fairly close, that's wild yeah yeah exactly and I mean depending on like what our quality standard is to you get faster or slower and I've definitely, like there's that that that last 20 percent like if you wouldn't do it with the big stuff like sky if you would actually do that with detail work that lasts 20 to get to 100 would take about as much as the first 80 yeah like it's diminishing returns right so you kind of have to balance the amount of detail that you you you put in, so yeah there's a lot of big impact changes in the beginning and then it gets slower and slower and slower and slower so you have to kind of know when to stop working on it and that's always a problem in this kind of work for sure yeah that's the game dev curse yeah yeah, exactly yeah this is kind of the first yeah 80 island that I think this is also the first look that a lot of people got outside of the world team, on to what was happening inspire coast or at least got an idea of exactly what we were wanting to do, and this was really nice I was really happy with the the results here so I was like oh nice this is going to be such a such a chill area so okay let's see what was next again oh right yeah and around the same time like a lot of these things are happening parallel, I was also doing some lighting tests just to kind of see what kind of coloring we wanted in this area and that's always kind of the thing that that has a huge impact on how an area is is perceived usually I only change the sort of 12 o'clock time because that's the time I always work in and that's the the time that has the, people see the most experienced the most and has the most impact on what an area looks like, so yeah we tried some color tests, and it was fun because like- I was I went with the sort of the the right most image for a while like this sort of like warm yellow green, and now we went back to blue so sometimes you go full circle you just go back to like actually the first thing was the best thing or like it's the first thing but like tweak just a little bit to fit better you know sometimes you go in circles and that's fine yes
>
> [Music]

> let's see and then we have the desert part, and I don't think a lot of stuff has been shown yet about this some some shots in the trailer yes very very sneaky shots because this area was like being worked on while I was making the the video and it was kind of wild because like from you guys perspective you didn't see this but when I was doing the first teaser trailer this area was pretty much just blocked out there was wasn't much here at all, and then when I was shooting for the next week doing the, like informational video suddenly this whole area just popped up and, yeah and I was like all right cool, I guess I could take some shots from it there's some issues with like some of the waterfalls they like render odd so I haven't shown too much from this because of that but like yeah and then even this week I noticed there's a ton of new stuff as well so yeah yeah exactly like, marie is the one who's working currently on this desert part and doing all of the detail stuff I did the the block out the the stuff that you see here and like some of the the first foliage that's which you'll see on the next slide, I think, just just to to break up, somebody asked whether I'm responsible for the stinger no I'm not I'm I don't take credit for this, I don't actually make any of the art assets myself I just place them mostly and I do some direction and I'm also not responsible for any of the creatures so I, refuse the hate
>
> [Music]
>
> do you even place like the spawners and stuff like that or is that someone else no I just do the visuals of areas like all the the gameplay stuff like the the the hazards the creatures the collectibles that stuff is all done by mark and ross and mostly rods at this point, they're, they're the peeps who do that how does that work like level design wise when like I guess you have some influence in terms of like if you make like a jumping puzzle or whatever and you want like some kind of reward maybe at the top or like is is that you sort of coming out with that or is that mark coming to you and be like oh be cool if you do this or like how does that work it's it's a mix it's kind of a mix where like I try to make interesting like locations where it's nice like for for collectible to be or make a little path or you know I try to create a lot of spaces where I think they would be nice for a creature encounter or a collectible or something, and then after after I'm done, like the others they go they go through it and they kind of play some things and if they need to like add some like roots or some jump puzzles they do that themselves most often, yeah so we like we kind of try to adjust to each other as much as we can that's it so yeah, yeah this one was fun because I at the the desert cliff set is very different from the the, other cliff sets so the shapes I can make with these are very different so I went for like a much more kind of like mushroom umbrella kind of feeling with these things, one of the big inspirations for this area was- I gotta get this right it was a ghibli movie and I think it was nausicaa all right we talked about this yeah there's this underground area there where it's like crystallized trees like this cave with these crystallized trees and this water everywhere and I wanted to sort of recreate a feeling but like warm obviously but that was one of those things that really was like- I want to make an area that feels like that like petrified or crystallized trees, and that movie is super cool so I'm like yes please yeah all right moves have very like distinct nature movies they're so they have such great atmosphere and environments so I definitely take some inspiration from those, and then yeah I did this was kind of like a mini version of what I did with the rest of the sparkles it took me a lot longer to figure out what I wanted to do here, so this one was a lot later than the other stuff but once I figured it out, I built this and then also immediately did the the big foliage pass and we we made like desert coral plateaus just like for this so we have the the gray kind that work with the grey cliffs and then the brown kind that work with the brown flowers just so we have like a nice match there, and then here you're gonna see the foliage, sketches so I picked one spire, to sort of test out like how is it going to look once it's that one is to like 80 so there's a little shot of like what it looks like on top it's basically a mix between doing desert assets inspired coast assets, and then and underneath all of it when more in shadow next to water, we like I added the like the the shot that you see on the the right like bottom right, where I did like that that's like the the the assets of the foliage assets set for that area so yeah that is essentially the the island of the desert spire, part

> all right and you got this bad boy we got this bad boy this is the first spire that I made, that was like final, and, let me just tell you all that ivy is the bane of my existence completely I it's yeah you do not want to know how much work goes into that stuff it's a pain what is what is the, why is it hard like what's the issue it's it's just when you paint on the ground there's generally only one direction the plants go and that's up when you paint on rocks I have to work with ivy that hangs and there's this like there's a problem like rock it goes all the directions and the foliage is painted like, either it always sticks the same way so I have to rotate every like piece of hanging ivy to actually work with the surface it's it's like attached to it's I have to manually rotate those things so you better appreciate the idea all right go walk up real close to it before you chainsaw it down or maybe it won't disappear when you use the chainsaw oh no it's not it will okay yeah no but it's it's ivy is like a big part of what makes this area feel so so lush and tropical so it's definitely a big impact on on the area's kind of identity so it's it's so nice but it's also a pain it looks really cool it looks so much more like detail with it yeah yeah exactly yeah that was the first spire that I made this is kind of when we've like actually entered full production left pre-production, and I say that and here's pre-production, so this was the first time I was like okay let's let's try to figure out what a coral reef underwater would look like and so I kind of took a mix of acids between blue crater assets cave assets and the new coral assets that we previously talked about and I just kind of played around and placed it in in a way and then you see one where I've like hidden the water so you kind of see what it looks like without the water on top of it and then with the water on top of it so there's definitely like shifts there we're still playing with how the water looks so that's gonna most likely be changed in some way sometime no atm that's though, but yeah it's, that one was like super super quick because, the the cave assets lend themselves incredibly well for this stuff so because we the the caves kind of have that underwater feel to them which is very deliberate so this works perfectly so you know win-win convenient convenient exactly and so this is the test and then in the next one you can see how it looks now when I've added like cliffs and the coral trees to it I actually framed everything as if it were like structurally at the landscape and I made the depth, work with what we wanted so this is how it is currently in the engine nice, do you use the trees as acids or foliage, I say acids and foliage very interchanged but most of the time I mean foliage everything that is like plant-like generally is foliage and the smaller rocks as foliage the things that are assets or static meshes that are always placed by hand are the cliffs the arcs, and like a lot of the the really big assets that are indestructible essentially

>, when designing terrain do you work with the world grid turned on, nope I don't a lot of our our areas are either below or above the world grid it's not very helpful at this point anyway, but no- I've kind of mentally automated sort of the the the scale of things so- I can see sort of how big things are in my mind's eye and occasionally I'll check by pulling in an asset like a building or the the player character just to check how big something is but otherwise I don't really use the grid whoa yeah it's it's it's not up here it's up there oh boy yeah yeah yeah, yeah and then I made this thing which you know I probably should have made way way earlier but hey we're here now, this is currently what I'm using in our internal tracking tool, to sort of track our progress with each area so I've divided everything into sort of islands and spires and like separate little little areas and then I make a set of those areas so for example the north most islands are set together and then I work on those all at the same time so like each of them have been given a an amount of weeks or days for me to like work on it and get it from where it is currently to the 80 mark and yes this is absolutely made in ms paint yes well you drew everything in ms payne that's amazing it looks really the whole thing I know like I just I can recreate the map from memory, very realistically I'm really good with lighting yep damn I thought jace was good but holy yeah yeah pixel my pixel exactly, and, one thing to note is that yeah you can see like the the little edge of the the northern forest, to the north but ironically it is technically the south, when you look at the in-game map yeah
>

> yeah so here you go chad here's the entire spider coast full overview of the entire spider coast, you can see the the canyon as well like at the the north, the top of the image yeah yeah how far does the water stretch down infinite that's it that's the end of the world yeah ms paint is definitely an official, development tool here we, we love it very much you saw it in the tools video you know we're using that yeah yeah absolutely of course like like- I don't want to do this in photoshop that's too much effort yeah just takes too long to boot it up yeah yeah exactly, yeah most a lot of this at this point is it has hit the 80 mark but not all of it but we'll take a look at that later see the kind it leads to the dune desert little one with water at the bottom you'll you'll be able to see that one later too, and yeah this is the point where like really production really just kicked off so, this is this is kind of where we're at now where we're getting, the the quality up to about eighty percent for every part of the the spherical so during all of the detail work and, yeah we we can just just give you give you like a tour cool of this stuff and just, just to give you a nice sort of closer comparison closer this is the this is taken from almost the exact same position, which cuts off a large part still of the sparrow coast that's off camera but that's the comparison shot between old and new, the the islands are definitely it's it's it stretches much further into the ocean than I think people expected, yeah absolutely your oil rigs are I'm so sorry but this is this is necessary believe me yes so we're gonna share some some insider tips here just gotta set it up on my end
>
> [Music]
>
> where did I put it again oh I put it here oh my oh my screwed but loving it it's a good mood yeah yeah somebody mentioned that there's going to be like a ton of videos from just the image that we showcased before yes- I look forward to it that is that is how that's how I feed that's how I feed I love that, by the way in the, in this last slide you had there would have said like this is the, 80 done you had like a bunch of floating rocks so confirm that floating rocks is part of the, part of the 80 yep oh right I'm not supposed to have it on this scene it's supposed to be on this scene hold on folks do it we're doing it live technical time yes I thought I was prepared before apparently I wasn't prepared enough camera where'd you go oh my god here it is are world ties smaller or more optimized than these reworked spots or is that someone else's job, they don't change size but ben helps a lot with optimization oh here we go live editor view this is this is, I've been working on this a little bit today so there's even stuff that none of no one at the studio has seen yet yeah it's like super super actually this is exactly what it is right now the state of the area you need one willow and a cave somewhere to pay tribute you know I think that is a great idea I want to do that they deserve it they deserve the tribute, did the rework go to the top of the waterfall for desert as well yes yes it did speaking of we can look that way and we can see that that desert wall like has has changed since last time we looked at it, and, currently work is being done here at the top yeah yeah so we are, marie is currently the owner of this area and she's been doing a ton of great work here and helping me out a ton so yeah exclusive reveal here we go this is what it looks like, it doesn't really have a lot of gameplay yet so don't expect to spot anything relevant but this is what the area, looks like currently very cool it's very different compared to like the just flat ground yeah it was it was just an unpainted canvas before essentially like this is, yeah and just to reiterate for anyone who didn't know like all the waterfalls that you see here right now are all placeholders this is obviously work in progress there's more things coming here water is very work in progress still in general but especially the waterfalls they're basically just there to say like this is gonna be a waterfall and it's gonna look better we have showcased like we have developed like quote unquote new technology or whatever you call like ben made the shaders and everything for the material for the new waterfalls we just haven't been able to like put them in the map yet so if you guys are curious about that there is a youtube video about that that we posted in november last week I think, I said devlog with jason ben so check it out maybe someone or maybe I can post it in chat somewhere I'm eager to get my hands on those yeah and then you can see here what people maybe are curious about this is this is still one of the in progress areas this is like how work in progress stuff looks like beautiful isn't it yes, so this is kind of where the the spire coast begins here, and where that big like bridge used to be from northern forest to this fire coast it's now a little bit more challenging and here we have a floating rock floating rocks yo you gotta make the jump now yeah yeah exactly, but yeah we're definitely still planning to work on this transition here, into into spare coast, but yeah but a lot of the canyon from about this point on is done so people who have been wondering, what's been happening to the canyon, it has undergone a bunch of changes but it is also largely the same, structurally so we've done a lot of like fixes with the weirdly skilled cliffs here because they were causing a lot of visual bugs and we've widened up the area so hopefully people can use this for some like really cool buses train lines pipelines whatever you want to do here I think would look really cool, and I have definitely added to the landscape so things might be either floating or a little bit swallowed but this area is the safest of this fire ghost area most likely for people to have built in but we'll see, bacon before asked what's up with the treetop lots, lads are still something that's very in progress so a lot of that popping that you see is is gonna either be improved or you know is is something that's placeholder or something like that like that is, in progress work yes I think we added those like pillar thingies as well to the canyon were those, these a lot of these were there already I actually removed a bunch of the plop the the platforms that were on the ground that made it impossible to drive through the canyon in one go and, some of the smaller like spires that were in the canyon to sort of open up some of the space so like these were already here yeah for example I've just kind of worked around them and and made a different build up around them I know that people are curious if you fly just like a bit more forward here oh yes yeah and then turn to the right I'm pretty sure people are curious as to what happens here like here oh yes this place this place so I know there's people that have been asking like how much of the river was encroached by this fire coast and the answer is some of it, not like most of I think most of you are safe from the pictures I've seen from factors here I don't think they went this far into spyro coast so no they I think they're fine probably and this is also I'm pretty sure that like when I did capture for this because I had like the the sequences set up so I can check the same sequence in a previous build and like this mountain that you're looking at right now is pretty much the exact same spot where the other like mountain started yeah exactly like, all I've added is that this this pillar essentially there is ground stuff that this is already there, and this wall was sort of already there as well I've just added this this pillar here, and then this monstrosity over here, is new to sort of meet this one that that's coming in from rocky desert you know, if you if you have some some little boats you can recreate the lord of the rings scene I was gonna say like you can't totally do the lord of the rings thing here like dude I built it exactly to be that okay really yeah yeah yeah absolutely just if people want to make some cool statues here I would love that, but they don't have to very nice I remind you of final fantasy no no no no no we don't do that I guess when I'm here no one ever excuse you holy, yeah very cool there's a bunch of check teams by the way real quick just something I forgot to tell you before, okay yeah so, yeah a couple of things that we might want to point out that we put on the video but like, for for update six just obvious this is obviously still working progress there's more stuff coming, for update six I believe that we won't be able to add like the new power slugs yet to this area maybe maybe not confirmed I don't think so yeah okay yeah but we are adding the crash sites do you know if any of the crashes are in this build no I don't think they are okay, that will come later by the way you guys yeah yeah yeah I think they just started adding stuff to this area, very recently yeah so because, some area of course a lot of it is now done enough for them to go in and add gameplay yeah another thing that we talked about we actually talked about this before hannah and I was that, we have moved the nodes the oil nodes in this area, and the thing is like the way we've made the extractors is that the way they work is that once you've placed them they like check they're like oh I'm above a node and I can be placed blah blah and then when you load back in they just know they're like oh I'm placed on a node but they don't actually like check like am I still on the node because we didn't really like anticipate moving the nose too much but we did an exception here, but they will still be tied to the oil note that they that we've moved so I've seen some people say that like oh if you move all nodes then I can I can place new miners and I can keep the ones that I have but they'll keep track of which node are just they won't be physically in the world with a notice so you can't double yeah exactly sorry bum bummer, but maybe we can show a couple of where the oil nodes are, yes yes, some of them are still floating so you don't see them on the terrain because they need to be pulled down, one is gonna be here let's see if I can like figure out if you can select it it's always hard to do when you're just I won't imagine that this is like 20 of your day it's just baby come on come on it's like trying to aim like scale it up and magic yeah look at that yeah, so here's one of them there are and now we're seeing the the beautiful mesh collection view, there are two over here yes those was the one video yeah this these are the most recent islands I've been working on yeah last week I made those, and then there is one over here that is floating still because this is still in progress you can see the difference between left and right here
>
> [Music]
>
> but this one is also still floating there you go peekaboo boom, and let's see there's one over here these are the northern irelands that I've been talking about a lot as you can maybe recognize this from the first like foliage test that was this little little area here and this is now changed but this is where I did the very first test yeah with the foliage that we did here I had, another fun fun story was when like two weeks before I made the actual like teaser trailer- I flew around and like checked out like an environment and took like snapshots of like oh this might be a cool shot and this might be a cool shot I had to I had to go to hannah with some of the shots of like I can't find this where is it like I took this it's not it's just a completely different area, and there's some here this little desert island here's two oh yeah yeah they're kind of spread out yep exactly,
>
> [Music]
>
> I feel like before they were much more like like hunched together in the canyon and stuff I think I think that's awesome cool and if not don't quote me on that yeah it'll be up to you guys too to find the rest yeah I guess, the rest is a treasure hunt I guess oh right here here's one I just pulled it I just I just saw it I was like, then they can quote me and I'm right yes yeah I think it's the same amount of oil nodes but I it might change I yeah I think I think so, I think they've just kind of moved them around and not changed, or added or removed any of them just move them I think the last time I talked to mark he said like yeah it's probably the same amount or more we'll see or maybe we'll add more in the future maybe we'll see one thing we have said is that we are going to add like more like general nodes to the spire coasts so you have like a more diverse set, because right now there's only oil nodes but in the future we want to have like a diverse set so you can better set up shop and like similar to how like the gold coast I guess we're like you have better possibilities to set up a factory layer like that's based on around old or whatever so it's not just oil, red 13 had a question why are the old no oil notes invisible when floating, it's because the the graphic is a decal and decoy works kind of like a projector, so imagine that there's like a little camera that's projecting an image, and the little box around them like the little little square is essentially the area that if that hits something solid like like in this case the landscape the the projected image actually is projected on top of that that space so if I would put this on a cliff the same thing would happen you'd see it on the cliff it's like it's like placing a sticker on on a shape yeah yeah exactly it's kind of like a sticker exactly and for that to work you have to have it within the bounding box of the shape that you want the sticker to stick to essentially yes yes, yeah decals, predicting the foundations and walls yeah I think I'm pretty sure like the, the stuff that, all of you use for like you know the the stickers and decals that you use work kind of the same way where it's like you know a sticker put on top of the foundations or the walls or something to like make the images appear or make the road things or yeah stuff like that it's kind of the same same deal with like footsteps and, like tire tracks work the same way yep same deal exactly, I'm checking oil yes it's fake it's all a lie everything's alive so I'm checking my notes there I think we've captured everything stop stop asking me to commit crimes mr taco please so yeah like this is a pretty you guys have gotten a pretty in-depth look here it's like as to what the spark look like at least as of today because this is I mean this isn't final anything yeah exactly like I think let's see for example here you can see like where where stuff ends it's like ah here we go the stuff that's that's been worked on and stuff that's not quite yeah still empty yeah- I did pick my angles when I shot the teaser yeah exactly just avoid avoid the stuff that doesn't have anything else I'm currently working on this little area here this little stream the geyser is in the same area in the canon yeah so far
>
> [Music]
>
> it's in a little pool I don't think that's moved now at least not since I caught that that's easier oh nope I remembered some more oil notes should I show them go for it all right it's up here oh yeah little valley here yeah there's two next to this big waterfall that absolutely makes sense what are you talking about you guys stop talking about the waterfalls obviously this is fine but it's it's more it's I don't think it's it's mostly the faucet one the other one on the other side yeah yeah I mean let's just say there's a reason that's all I'm going to say
>
> [Music]
>
> yeah I haven't seen there's a couple of I'm a bit disappointed because there was one shot in the teaser trailer that- I felt like I made it super obvious that there's something going on but nobody really caught up on that yeah and it's visible right now as well but I won't I won't delve more into it than that so yeah pissed off mystery oh mystery
