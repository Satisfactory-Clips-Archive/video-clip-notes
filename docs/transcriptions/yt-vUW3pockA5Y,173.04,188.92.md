> Because looking at the camera will feel like kind of, like i'm staring. Hi, I'm Oscar JilsÃ©n [aka Nastya Sam] and i'm the Game Director at coffee stain studios. The initial idea of satisfactory was actually a base defense game. I remember it as it was yesterday, we were talking about game ideas, what can we do, what's a fun game. That was in the stage when we were starting to brainstorm for what's to come after Goat Sim[ulator]. And this idea about a base defense game came up. It's like you need to go and you have to build everything from scratch. But its not crafting like survival crafting is, it's more Factorio inspired. So it actually started as a base defense game primarily, then the factory part got bigger and bigger, and the fighting part got smaller and smaller. So we actually just decided to not have that base defense aspect in at all. I mean obviously we had a lot of discussions about it, cause it's a very compelling type of gameplay. We felt that it went very contrary to the main part of the game. We felt that, if a part of the game loop is about counter acting what you are doing primarily, it doesn't really fit. The electricity goes out and suddenly you are.. sure you have turrets but they can't do anything. So it's sort of the same problem, it's arguably even worse cause you did everything you could and then it's fucked anyway. That's why we got rid of it. Combat will be.. it's not a super big part.. but it is a part and you can't really avoid it, cause when you go out and explore, especially when you find new resources, sometimes there will be nests of enemies, and they live like on top of the resource you want. So you have to get rid of them to be able to get the resources. But also as you are exploring for other stuff, they're gonna be around in the environment. It's gonna be impossible to play the game without having to fight enemies. I'm concerned about... all of it. I mean, it's a huge project and there is so many things interacting. I mean I'm still not happy with it, we wanna not only create opportunities for players to ultimate things, but also want to create challenges. For example there is the reinforced steel plate, to get enough screws you gotta go one and a half structures. And that setup.. obviously you can't just build one, or you can build one, if you overclock it, or you can build several. We wanna find these places where we can make things a little bit off. They go together, if you figure it out, it's sort of like a mini puzzle. If you play singleplayer you have to do everything yourself. If you play multiplayer then maybe you only build and you never go out and explore. And thats fine, some people like that. We have signs and things planned so you can mark things just like &quot;here is the iron&quot; and &quot;here is the gold&quot;. Oh yeah, you can color things, select whatever color you want and paint the buildings and vehicles. You know as a developer you get really home blind, cause you understand it so thoroughly and you can really miss obvious things that are wrong. Getting people to play it will.. first of all we will find a million bugs, that we never thought would happen, and we will find a million little mistakes that we made, we will be able to tweak and change things to fit better together. The design tasks to do change in scope basically, cause when you start out in the beginning of a project you do very very broad strokes. As for Game Director versus Game Designer it's a lot of, i guess, administrative work. Now we gotta also review people's work,

> People will come to you and they will tell you: &quot;Oh, i saw this and then when we added this i thought this would be really cool.&quot; And sometimes that's absurd, like, that's a terrible idea. But sometimes it's a really good idea. What's more important is knowing which ideas work well together. So what you should do is let people express the ideas to you, bad ideas are not necessarily always bad, they just don't fit in this case. So filter out the things that don't fit and let the things that fit well go in because you make the game better and you make that person more excited to work on the game. Often people don't really know, like they have this idea and they don't really know what it is and they are trying to express it. Sometimes you gotta help them to get it out, fish it out. I am a lurker, so i lurk for some shit and I find out what...

> Well.. uh.. Coffee Stain, right? ..so i lurk for some shit and I find out what people say. Feedback, ideas, like the trello board was amazing. Not everything works in the game as it is now, some other things are good and especially when we see things, people are saying: &quot;you should do this&quot; I'm like: &quot;we got that planned&quot;, it feels good. It's sort of a sign that we are on the right track. It is exciting that people have been this responsive. I truly didn't expect this much hype, i mean i thought the game was good, i was hoping that other people would do as well, but i think the response has been massive, i didn't expect that and obviously thats really fun. It gives us a lot of energy, cause now we know that people love it, and its more people than we thought. You know, we gotta make the best game,

> so, i guess: thanks!

> How does someone feel if they only come up with [pipe] ideas? If they only come up with shit ideas? Well then they feel bad i guess, but they should feel bad, cause their ideas are shit.
