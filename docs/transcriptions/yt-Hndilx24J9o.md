> would it be possible slash considered it to have a smaller blueprint machine earlier in the tech tree and have a larger one later in the tree, I think it's funny that you mentioned you want a smaller one but no there's no plants or consideration for that at the moment, the La I would like to say that like a lot of extensive research went into deciding what the size of the blueprint machine is but I actually don't know if we did but maybe but, yeah like the the I think I think so far we're quite happy actually with the size of the permit even though it feels frustrating for you guys because like one thing to consider is that just increasing it so it's like five by five by five instead of four by four by four that actually increases by twice the size in terms of cubic meters, so like it is is a significant change to just increase like one Foundation size yeah, yeah I actually I mean- I should probably play it a little bit more but- I you know so I can have a better sort of opinion on this but like I really do love this approach of just this limited size that is like big enough for most things but a little bit too short small for other things because I think it's just it's honestly such a really really interesting solution for this feature yeah because it could have been as mindless as just like copy paste everything but now it's it brings this other sort of like fun and challenging aspect where it's like all right now I need to sit down and and focus on my blueprints like this is a new kind of gameplay that I'm playing now right I'm gonna sit I'm gonna plan I'm gonna like make this modular I'm gonna rearrange it on my hot bar this way and then I'm gonna go out and execute what I've planned beforehand and- I think it's super clever I can't believe that they sort of thought of that I don't know if that was really an obvious solution but I thought it was really clever yeah I liked it I think so too I think it's it's also like interesting how it becomes a game within itself where you try to puzzle it together and like make tiles out of itself, that's where the game designers are squeezing out every ounce of potential gameplay and fun out of literally everything you can get yeah exactly, I was also honoring like technical limitations and other features too so, and it's always like if we if we were to increase it or whatever it's always be like yeah it's not my five but what about six by six by six like why can't it be like one more it doesn't matter it just never ends, I think I saw someone else earlier saying like what can we have like a conveyor belt that does even more that won't be going and it's it's the exact same thing it's like if we had another conveyor but that's quicker than the current ones people will just say oh can we have one quicker again, yeah
