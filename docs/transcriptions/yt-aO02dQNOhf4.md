> said update 1.0 might be a big update that's the case when a lot of features create lots of bugs kind of defeating the point of moving out of early access early access is you know it people define it very differently, I think from a developer standpoint early access is the period where you've sort of set the game to be still in like development in terms of what the goal is to after releasing it, you know you can still release a game and it can still be buggy and it can still be the final release of the game if that makes sense you know I think I think there's a couple of games may come in mind, that are not early access but they're buggy there's there's a distinction here like a game that's in a game that has this full of bugs does not necessarily mean that it's in early access, early access is all about like the features that you're getting like you're you're getting early access to the the game in in a state where we don't feel like it is finished, so it doesn't really tell like a game like la like having bugs is not really the telltale for whether or not it's out of early access the main thing for us really is that it's feature complete okay so the game will have all its features and it's it's highly likely that we'll do a same round with like we will release the 1.0 the the the gold candidate on experimental first and then when we're happy with that we'll move that over to ea and that will be the official 1.0 release if that makes sense so there'll still be that like period of us fixing the the the major issues that may creep up when the release release in the game but I'm pretty confident that we'll do more like qa internal rounds for that release because we are we haven't really treated the the updates update that we've made so far as like proper proper releases, because it's very expensive to run qa's process on full like or not inc like full feature sets essentially but when we're close to 1.0 we probably do more of that, move to ea exactly no move too early act, move out over yeah that's true actually we won't be in ea anymore we'll be in like the the final release of the game we'll be in the final version so it won't we won't actually move it to ea we'll move it to the final release we won't be able to call that branch ea anymore my god, so yeah hopefully that answers your question
