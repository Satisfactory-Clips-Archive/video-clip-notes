### Transcript

> uh yeah uh so the other thing with lights fun fact other thing with lights we actually didn't know if we were gonna have a mitten until oh yeah really recently like like like weeks ago because we were trying to get it in uh the reason we haven't had lights in the game is because they're actually really hard to do um there's like a lot of like technical issues with lights uh to make them efficient things like that and so we thought we knew how to do it we ran into some issues we were struggling we thought it was good we weren't sure and so we didn't know if we were going to make it into update four or not but uh i think it was like yeah just a few weeks ago uh word came through that ben yeah exactly simon ben uh ben pulled through with um with the lights so big shout outs to ben you guys ben is like you know he's the father of lights yeah it's kind of weird to be like he's the reason they exist you know we're a massive team where the reason you know we all work together but ben ben had his head down in lights and uh yeah he got it to work so so shout out to ben you guys ben is my new hero indeed yep and i had kind of written the script so that if we don't have lights we can cut this part out because it we can just as well go from like you did it snowed from the end of that video segment but boy howdy we were hoping yeah yeah this is one of the highest moments of the video as well it's really good exactly so uh okay
