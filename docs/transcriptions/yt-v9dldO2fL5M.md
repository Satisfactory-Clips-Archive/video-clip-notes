> what other genre of game would you like to create after satisfactory oh that's hard like I don't think there's a specific genre of game that I would want to make like I just want to I just want to make a good game you know yeah, and it's okay if like the genre is different I think I think this is a really interesting question because like I can answer this question in many different ways because there's both like games that I would want to play like those aren't necessarily the games you want to develop because sometimes for instance rocket league is a good example that's the one I always use broccoli is like one of my favorite games but I would never want to work on that game because you know at least in the in the form that is right now because they're mostly doing maintenance work in that game and the problems they're trying to solve with that game right now are really really difficult, so so like jumping on board on that game would be really difficult and there's a bunch of games that I can think of that are like that where you have to solve like really difficult problems which could be interesting but also sounds like a lot of a lot of like grind if you know what I mean, but but, and then there's also the type of game where like also makes sense for coffee stain to make you know they could be my personal preferences like what I would like to work on but you know also one important factor when making game is a game is that it has to like the people that are working on it has to also it has to fit with like what we're good at making yeah so you know like if if I don't I couldn't make an rpg I would like to make an rpg but I think that's an interesting like problem, but you know I don't have any I don't think I had the right mindset to to make the balancing of that work and and and like if we if we just take for example if we take the team at coffee stand for example now like let's just say hypothetically here let's say we weren't good at like we're not really a team that you know would be good at making rpg maybe we are maybe we're not I'm not sure but let's just like hypothetically say that we're not even if I would like to make an rpg game which I would like to make I wouldn't then want to make it with coffee stain like why like because it was just gonna be it's just gonna be a nightmare for us it's gonna be a bunch of people who don't excel in this area you know if there's no passion in it either then it's like we're all doing something that we don't really believe in or that we wouldn't do a really good job on like I wouldn't want to do that like I would want to work with the rest of the team on something that we're good at yeah, that we believe in and that we feel good about working on so like it so it doesn't really matter about the genre because like there might be a genre that I like but if it doesn't jive with everyone then we're not going to do a good job and I don't really want to be part of that team in that case you know because that's a huge aspect I think a lot of people think that like because you always hear those stories but like with bigger studios where they have like one creative director that's sort of deciding a lot of things and that's that's one approach to do it but I think a lot of smaller and this is more common in the game dev industry is that you sort of games sort of come from a lot of people coming together with that creative kind of mindset so it's really hard to say that like one person had one idea that was this game that we developed it's usually a bunch of different, people coming together to develop something and then you obviously have like a game director something that guides that that like game but it always kind of boils down to like what makes sense for people that are working in the game to be making for that game so like if you have a lot of 2d artists for instance it doesn't make sense to just like make a 3d game all of a sudden maybe, but like like personally you know like I have like like some motivation and inspiration to make a game but like I want I want to make a game with like a story and I want to make it a small game but like in that case this motivation and inspiration is not really something that I would want to do with coffee stain necessarily because again that depends on everyone else but like I would like to do something small on my own on the side one day you know and if I did do that I would want to do some kind of like narrative kind of storytelling game, but yeah it's not like one person what like that doesn't work that way necessarily when you think of the whole team yes if everyone wanted to do that then cool let's do it but it has a jive with a lot of people I think, yeah at least I think every game I worked on there's never been like there's never been one person sort of pushing for an agenda it's always been or not agenda but like one idea guy there's always been like somebody brings something up and then sort of tests the water with that idea and then maybe someone and then like see where it goes essentially I think that's one of the cool parts working together with other people is the whole like you know you have an idea of what something will be and then you sort of share with others and then they bring something to the table that you didn't anticipate or think about and then we're all working to get towards like one you know unified goal one goal that you couldn't you couldn't have got to alone yeah exactly exactly yep
