> any plans for vehicles to hold more than one player I don't think so so like they used to hold two as you can see like in the the explorer there's two seats there's actually like you may you may not have seen it but on the sugar cube the little tractor you know where your player stands but on the other side on the front left side there's like a little seat and the other player used to sit there but that was removed from the game, before release I believe it was before release, and I don't think it's coming back I don't think it's coming back you guys
