### Transcript

> but let's actually talk about something else really important we can let's talk about last week's video shall we this the stuff that that I talked about in the last week's video If you guys haven't seen it then don't bother because I'm gonna give you a quick quick rundown of everything in it I just need to find my notes again because apparently I closed the tab where I had my notes in but essentially we released a video where we talk about update 7. and Update 7 is coming this year which I think came to a surprise for a lot of people I don't think anyone expected, us to release it so soon and to some extent need neither did we, let's start with that yeah update seven sorry yeah update seven it's coming sometime in November, the reason why we want to release it this year so so it's coming in November on experimental and then sometime before the end of the year we're going to roll it over to Early Access, and then one of the main reasons why we're doing it this year is because we scheduling wise we kind of need to do it so this time around usually the way we do it is like we have an update of things we want to do and like that we Define like this is the content we need for it and if we don't finish the content in time for like whatever we schedule to do it then we'll just be like all right let's delay it and release it later or you know they will be last did what we do with update six maybe where we release it in some form and then we'll keep working it for a long time and blah blah blah this time around we felt like we need to get some parts of this update out as soon as possible so and like the only good time slot for that if we're not waiting until like later next year would be to release it this year essentially so we're doing the opposite route here where we're instead of saying okay we're gonna release an update this year what can we do in the time frame up until then essentially and then we'll just release what we can and it's it's a really short time frame so like there's not too much you know coming in this update because like I said it's a really short time frame

>, so so that's that's on the when and sort of why when kind of question next question is what is in update seven I guess, and, yeah one of the cool things that's coming up to seven is game modes we've talked a long time that we're gonna do game modes and, we're gonna start it off by making this like an initial release of game modes and, the the for the most part the only game mode that's really coming up at seven is shut up when I was recording the video I was laughing about that too a lot, and I could not unhear it anyways, game modes the one game mode that's coming in Update 7 is passive mode or like peaceful mode or what I'm gonna call it, so, because that's like we have we have two game modes that are highly requested by Community one of them is creative mode and one of them is peaceful mode, those are easily the top two ones that we've seen and creative mode we don't want to add just yet because it will sort of Muddy the feedback that we're getting if people are can just like place and build whatever you want, kind of mud is like the the feedback that we get from Community when it comes to, balancing to the game essentially so it's hard to know like which part of our community are doing what and the thing is like if you want creative mode it's sort of doable already you know there's ways to sort of use mods to enable that and stuff like that so like if people really really really miss it you know it's somewhat doable to do already so yeah that's another reason why like move it didn't feel like we have to get creative mode in before 1.0, so that's that there's a bunch of other game modes that are on our radar and there's a bunch of game modes that sort of like I mean the more we can do the better I think, I think we are interested in doing a bunch of them so we'll just have to see sort of wait and see what we managed to do before 1.0 and then what goes for 1.0 and stuff like that, I mentioned in the video that like we're introducing peaceful mode in the future we might add more on top of that you know so like you know I don't know what we'll do exactly but it could be things like where we had you know difficulty slider maybe or like setting of how animals behave or maybe you want them to like not attack you if like if if you don't attack them they want to attack you but if you start attacking creatures then they'll defend themselves maybe that's also you know a different setting for that, so we'll sort of see what happens in the future, regarding that and, yeah I think the the most hype thing that people saw was the conveyor belt ceiling mounts, we're yeah we're adding ceiling mounts they're pretty sick and they do the thing with like the, I should have made a video showing this but the guidelines that you have like they will work with the ceiling mounts as well so you can like line them up with stuff I've seen some people ask about like Splitters and mergers on the ceiling mounts so like will they be need like is there an easy way to line them up as well it's a good piece of feedback at the moment they don't work that way but it's not impossible that we'll you know find some time while we're in experimental maybe before then to sort of get that snapping working so, we'll we'll have to like use that sort of time when we're an experimental to like maybe catch that feedback and see if we can look into it essentially so but at the moment they don't work that function that way but maybe in the future, what else is in the video, there's the coupon stuff if you didn't know we've added a new track for coupons so you can now also sync the, organic organic data capsules which by the way they will change names so it's kind of confusing in the video they say like DNA Capsule that's the new name, apparently I don't know why we changed names but apparently we are, so organic data capsules will now be called DNA mod capsules or something DNA cop whatever yeah they run on separate tracks now so so like when you're syncing items they go on one track and like regardless of which item it is and when you sync the organic data capsules they will go on a separate track, and that's so that so that like you'll get an incentive for you know dealing with the local fauna, because if you already if you already have had synced a bunch of stuff in the sink then you know adding anything on top of that wouldn't really make it might make much of a difference but having it this way when there's two separate tracks it means that they're more valuable early game and they're also valuable regardless of how much you've been sinking in the awesome shop in the awesome sync so so even if you've already used to also think in your late game you can still sort of sync the data tables, the the Gated capsules geez and

>, you'll still get a bunch of tickets from that so, looking for that it's it's kind of sweet actually, it might be tweaked a little bit in terms of like how much you get because right now it's it's like you get a thousand for every capsule that you sink in the sink that value might go up and down a little bit in between now and and when we actually release the update, where's the DNA milking meta I hopefully never but you never know hmm, so that's that and, let's see here overclocking overclocking Good Times all right next Point next next question, overclocking the one thing so overclocking we've had this session before overclocking will change in update seven I can tell you that much, I'm not sure exactly what the change will be, because we're sort of going back and forth a little bit on that, as we're testing but, one thing that we do know we're changing with overclocking is that for power generators right now, the fuel rate or whatever the burn rate for fuel is is linear but the output isn't and we're going to change this to the output is is like impact like is matches you know the the burn rate essentially which will make them linear fully linear, the the thing on that as some people have asked me about it and you know there's there's there's obviously like kind of two groups of people like either you want to change overclocking to the game or you don't want to change overclocking, for power generators specifically the only real trade-off that's in the game at the moment is that you have to build more of them to get more power off out of them if you overclock and we don't think that's an interesting trade-off for power generators so that's why we're going with this approach, like and there's you know even if if that's the only reason like there is still a trade-off of you still have to collect the Slugs and stuff like that, so I mean this still is a trade-off but it's not ass like the time the trade-off that exists right now is just that it's kind of time consuming kind of like a little bit of resources but you know this is a game where it's it's an infinite Builder essentially where you have you get like an infinite amount of resources so like the only real resource is really space and like time and like you know that kind of stuff so we felt that it makes sense to to change that, so yes and I think that was it right did I talk about anything else I mentioned that creatures probably won't be happening in update seven they'll probably come later there's apparently some dependency on the world Branch, World Branch also don't know when that's happening so enjoy Paradise Island for as long as you can, because yeah we don't know at the moment when we'll introduce any changes to the world map, so so do what you want with that information will it just turned into a large waterfall so okay I can I can do a repetition of that because we we sort of talked about it there at the start of the stream, we are gonna probably do something about the island, but not exactly sure what it is so so the the the decision the the the decision internally relief when it comes to Paradise Island is that we're not going to spend any time on it essentially which means that when we're looking at that Island it's sort of not finished
>

>, and there's a couple of options we have you know either we just don't do anything with it or either we nuke it completely or remove it or you know we, I don't know like one of the options we have but we we haven't really like decided that we're gonna remove it we just decided that it's canceled in terms of like we're not doing much with it and maybe that means that we'll remove it completely from the game maybe that just means that we make it so that you can't go there at all I don't know, but the waterfalls I think will stay around so like if you've built any water extractors there you'll find, etc etc we can move the heal box but it's kind of weird because we have to set a border at some point eventually anyways so if it means that people start building there for for no apparent reason and you know that area doesn't feel like it's living up to the expectation of what we feel like that area should look like you know then it's probably easy for us to use remove it we'll see we'll see what happens, y'all have definitely voiced your opinion on it that's that's for sure but, you know with with change comes sacrifices sometimes, they're late the rest of the map and then keep Paradise Island fair enough all right well let's do that you have there's no there are no notes on that island but I'm sure you'll figure that out it's good for nuclear waste I'm sure there are other options as well because like we're also going to do at some point it's so okay there's two things that aren't mentioned by the way in that, on the map that we put out one thing is that caves is completely like independent from the world map so like, caves, have their own like separate track so even if it says like even if it says in an area that like this air is almost finished if there are caves in that area there they might not be finished, so so they run a separate track essentially another thing that also runs a separate track is like the world border so there's a couple of places around the map where there's like a pretty you know there's a definite like you can see the the Border where like it's a square thing poking out or like if water doesn't match you know the color of what they have in the biome and stuff like that that's also a separate thing so you know that's that's going to happen as well in parallel, it might be the last thing we do I'm not quite sure there, but it's not part of like the general map building biome you know kind of deal so so caves and borders around the map, you know they they're they live their own they live by their own rules and that affects the Paradise Island because Paradise Island is on the border of the map so when we're doing those border changes that's sort of when we'll know what to do with Paradise Island essentially cool I think I brought everything up here we're gonna do fixmest again this year it's gonna come back it's gonna be a rerun of last year it's not going to be any new stuff last year we barely had any new things either, but this year for sure we won't have any new things, because update seven is gonna take up so much of our time and, yeah cool let's see here that's it that's it
