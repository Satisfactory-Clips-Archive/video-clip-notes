> much appreciated, so one more thing I wanted to address is that a lot of people who haven't played an experimental came back to to, satisfactory on ea and had some issues with, specifically like the pipes and the power set up like they're losing power and, one thing maybe we weren't super super clear about this but I feel like we've talked about this a lot a lot and that is that the power generators in satisfactory are now always 100 power generating, so we made some changes to how power generation works in that regard and if you didn't have a power setup that was sort of like set up for that in in mind, then you're gonna run into power spike so you need to like fix that with your your power setup so if you if you had like a bunch of coal generators and you were never using full power, then now your generators are going to use full power and if you haven't like set up your coal lines your water line so to be able to like adjust for that then you're going into power spikes and that's what most people are running into, there are however a few issues with pipes as well these are issues that we've sort of, these are issues that we think have existed in satisfactory since before update four, but I know a lot of people are reporting some specific issues and when we've looked at these issues we've kind of like identified that for the most part these are very specific cases, and and it's something that we like we've recognized it before but it's it's not like the majority of people's issues currently are the power issues so it's it's like it's kind of hard to, to, to know whether or not they're because of those like specific pipe issues or if they're because of power but for the most part it's power, we are gonna address those issues with the pipes eventually, but we don't know exactly when, but very soon they're kind of high prio for us but we also the issue really for us currently is identifying people's different like problems they're having like with the power set up and whatnot and like the vast majority of people reaching out to us are because of the the power changes that we did
