### Transcript

> and i saw a lot of people also speculating about like what's with the song like they're a bunch of mentioning like you mentioned samura and you mentioned, smelters and stuff like that it doesn't mean we're gonna smell samura and stuff like that and that was just, we just wanted that song and then, and then we just changed a few words just because yeah for format it felt weird having like the the like it end on snake eater so i just replaced it with sam eater yeah, avoid the copyright claim yeah and, we also tried to get, aydah to sing the whole thing to sing it with that, voice and all, it was just too much work we had our sound, engineer emil he he worked a little bit on it so we did, quite a quick waste of the time on that, but it would have been so funny if we got it to work but unfortunately no but i think the spoken word thing was also pretty funny that was really good i think it was better that way okay now i've got the trailer thingy set up for later as well oh sweet
