> I like how jase is playing a completely different game than simon that that is that's true but that's something that's cool about this right because like I'm I'm not good like I can do the factory stuff in my own slow pace on my own right but when I'm playing with those I'm not very good at keeping up with them quite frankly but the exploration side of things is so good it's still like like I'm being useful I am these things that I'm grabbing are important that's what I tell myself it is no but it is and I also I also like the exploration stuff a lot because I don't get to do a lot of that at work when I when I work on the game because I'm mostly fixing like factory stuff and like optimizing how they talk to each other and stuff like that so I never get to like run around so I also like that's my favorite part of the game so far
