### Transcript

> uh are there mods you might put into the game uh if so it's always uh like a coincidence essentially there might be one day where we'll look at a mod and we'll be like oh we didn't think of that we should put that in the game but like pretty much i guess close to 100 of the time or it will be 100 of the time that the the that the mods we put into the game are just features that we're always going to put into the game and the reason for that is because just we've been working on this game for so long and we've thought a lot about our [ __ ] dumb game yeah and like yeah some things you we can't do ourselves uh or like we don't want to do right now ourselves maybe um so and and sometimes it's like we've thought of one version of doing it and then maybe someone makes a mod that has like a slight like different implementation of it maybe of like yeah but for the most case we've we've thought of most things that people have made most or like uh yeah sorry sometimes even we've prototyped stuff uh internally and we're like yeah this could be a thing and then somebody makes a mod for like [ __ ] we swear we thought of it
