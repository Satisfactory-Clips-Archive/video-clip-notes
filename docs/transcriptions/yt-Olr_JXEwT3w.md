> can they can move this get the option to auto connect power pipes and belts to adjacent stuff do we I think we just mentioned that before right it's it's a little bit too much, hassle to get that working, unfortunately because there's a lot of it's too lazy yeah that's what it is there's a lot of edge cases, it's not impossible I guess, please I'll put that on a keyword site if there's a post about it, but when we started implementing the blueprint designer stuff, that was like a conscious decision that like within the blueprint it's fine because then we have control and that's like an easy solution to do it that way but if we're gonna have it to like blueprints know about other Blueprints and like figure out how they connect and stuff like that it makes it a little bit more complex, and it's like time we'd rather spend on other things to implement and rather design around that sort of so it's like a you still need to hook up your blueprints
