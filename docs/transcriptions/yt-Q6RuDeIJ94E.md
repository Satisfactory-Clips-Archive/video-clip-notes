> can trains nudge each other or is it instantly that all hell breaks loose so I mean once they collide they derail even if it's a very soft touch but it doesn't necessarily mean that they fly off like because they use physics if it's a soft touch then the carts probably won't fall off or whatever but the train breaks down basically yeah I think actually g2 added a little bit of logic recently where if they're coming in at like very slow speed they won't derail because when I tested this, the closeness I think it might be for the we we're also trying to like guard ourselves a little bit we're like if you're loading an old save in update four and you have like trains inside each other, we've added a little bit of like logic so that you can so they won't like completely fly out of the place and and you can end up in a situation where you can never dismantle them we had a bit of logic for that and I think he had a little bit of extra logic where if the trains are very slow and they're close to each other they won't like fly off the track they'll just stay stop or something because I couldn't I couldn't recreate that bug, when I was doing the taking that picture before right so there might be some some like some safeguards there that I won't like absolutely fly off but I'm not 100 sure on that
