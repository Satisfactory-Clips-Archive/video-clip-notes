> is there any talk about new resource locations since there's so many beautiful places in the world that we never see because they're 100 devoid of resources yes I think so there are a few, snoot knees sleeves there's a few, planned resources police research nodes that we planned that we're gonna add I wish- I wish I remembered specifically what that is it's either bauxite or more sulfur I think we've planned to add more of somewhere but I'm not sure I can't remember also something that might be good to bring up if we ever have a sneak peek of the new world update I think it's sulfur because I think it's yeah sulfur is sorely lacking I think it's sulfur, I think that's something mark brought up as well, that the bauxite changes what we did made it so that some of the, like if you had setups for like some of the aluminium setups, it made it so the sulfur became more of a, rare resource, and we're gonna try and balance that, but he might be talking about box I'm not quite sure I don't remember I have a memory of a rake you can add that to the wiki
