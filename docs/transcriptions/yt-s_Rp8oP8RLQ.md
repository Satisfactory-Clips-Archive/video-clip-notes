> for sure crashing without a crash report what can i do to report it, qa site i guess is the best way, and let us know that you're getting a crash without the crash reporter because those crashes are the worst because there's like almost no data for us to go on in those cases, so yeah try try and post up post us up on the qa site and maybe we can see if we can figure out what's going on but those are really tricky to solve unfortunately
