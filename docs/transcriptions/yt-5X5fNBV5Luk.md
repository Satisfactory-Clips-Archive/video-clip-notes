### Transcript

> i know that uh ben put in a lot of effort this time around to like make sure that like there wasn't too much z fighting going on when we're placing things because we're doing some special things now when we're placing certain cosmetics we're doing like a random scaling to certain things so that you know everything wouldn't have the same values we would scale them up and down a little bit randomly um just to like mitigate the z fighting so it's a lot better uh and yeah maybe maybe it's so good that you can do this stuff without that all that annoying z fighting going on yeah really nice very cool very impressed
