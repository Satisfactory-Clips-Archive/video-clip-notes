### Transcript

> you guys solve the oh okay can you solve the precision problem or is it going to stay we don't know, I will tell you this I'm going to give you guys a little bit of a like insider knowledge here and maybe I shouldn't talk about this because we actually don't know the actual like benefit to this but one thing we've realized when it comes to pipes and the 600 over like what's called the 600, flow rate is that that number is too high, we don't see a good way to solve like the issues precision issues we have with that number being that high and we kind of knew that when we pushed the update that like maybe 600 is too much we maybe it won't be good, so so that number might get decreased now we might when I say decreased I obviously mean that like everything is going to rebalance with it so like they won't actually affect you guys probably too much, but it might yeah it might be the case where we do 500 and 250 instead of 600 so scale everything down yeah exactly but we'll see we'll see because because then we're like okay but how are the numbers in the game right now do they make sense is the ratio good for like call generators maybe we need to change those as well, yada yada maybe the division isn't like good so, so yeah just letting that out there but this is also too early to talk about this because we are not like close to like looking at this in the near future, you know- I don't think we'll touch that stuff for a while, the main reason is just that it's a like it's fine when you have a good enough frame rate but once the frame rate drops it becomes like the precision issues with those high numbers fluctuate so much that it becomes really difficult for the game to keep up so, yeah there you go might come with like the rest of the game rebalance but, yeah we'll see we'll see
