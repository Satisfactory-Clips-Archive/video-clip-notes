### Transcript

> foreign be added no so sleeping wouldn't work in the game because well Define work but you can't like one thing with the game is if you were able to like bypass time then you would sort of like one big aspect of the game is you we want people to automate stuff and the best way to get the realization that you need to automate stuff is realizing that like time is a big resource in the game so if you're able to like fast forward you know set a production chain and then just fast forward kind of breaks part of the game, it kind of negates a big part of of the urge for you to automate better you know so don't like that and also sleeping like this is not a survival game like there's no mechanic behind sleeping so like if that's not the case then what is the point of sleeping bypassing the Knight maybe but the night's so short now, and we would rather fix it so that night makes sense so I mean yeah so nope we don't see a point in having a sleep mechanic
