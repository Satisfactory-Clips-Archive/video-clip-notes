> when I when I used to work as a photographer sometimes I do like you know the classic like school shoot you know where no whoa not like that okay whoa calm down okay, school photography right when you're taking pictures of you know upper secondary schools and stuff like that and I had a thing wherever people would do like this or or you know like this I'd always be like no gang signs and they'd be like wait what it's so funny, the [ __ ] were we talking about yeah circular, so yeah we I talked to someone in community about triangular we don't even have that, so upvote that on the keyway side I don't know if there's like some kind of kind of technical I don't think there really is any technical reason for it I think the snapping is just like something that is a bit trickier for non-rectangular, boxes because we're using retain rectangular boxes for almost all collisions in the game so we would need to make something like special for that then and I guess that's the reason why we don't have it right now make sure to upload it on our keyword site, so that we can see that and be like yeah maybe this is something that I mean we already see a lot of cool stuff and it feels like it's something that community really wants so my vote is yes but it's not enough to me, so yeah make sure to upload it on the keyway site
