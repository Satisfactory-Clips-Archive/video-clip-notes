> ever thought of making twitch integration in the game we have, actually thought about that the the problem with twitch integration is that, I think it would be pretty cool and- I and- I wish we had a better opportunity for it because I think we could do something really interesting because I think I think a lot of games that have twin certification are pretty stingy about it and I don't understand why, but the problem with the game is that like it's very easy to cheat stuff so like if people are watching and they get coupons or whatever then they could they could get coupons some other way so like maybe it's a fun thing as a bonus on top of that, but I think it would be cool to have like you know twitch integration where like you can spawn like maybe enemies or something like that or you know the ones where people make it so that you turn around and dismantle something or like that I think those type of integration, things would be pretty cool, but yeah the hard thing is just like valuing like what what's worth doing, but if people have ideas please post them on the QA side, and let us know, what you would like to see like twitch chat on signs and stuff would be also be cool so we've definitely thought about it but it's always like either we work on that or we work on, something else you know like it's it's always like a question of like what do we spend time on
