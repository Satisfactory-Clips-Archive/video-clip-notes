### Transcript

> yeah, is there anything else that I haven't brought up that we that we, that you guys want to talk about for the update, I mean we talked about the spire coast mm-hmm there is also swansea the area yeah I feel like swamp got like a few more new ish yes yeah more new assets on that one compared to, like spider coast actually yeah like that one got more new stuff yeah we wanted to make it look way more like sickly and kind of dead yeah yeah trump really really had had a lot more change a lot more figuring out along the way I think yeah like because more concepting more yes like and and seeing how much do you have to change existing assets because with spire coast I mean we have a fair amount of corals and tropical plants to play around with but swamp, I mean the the old version of the swamp I mean the for example the water that was one of the biggest changes the water was crystal clear somehow yeah and there was this like sort of red duckweed on it and it looked really bad so we actually made it like look muddy and stuff like that and just feel much more like a swamp yeah and then we also have the the stretch of land that is close to the to the ocean, that one is actually much more salt marsh inspired so that that like we have different types of swamp, marsh landscape yeah and we went through some iterations with the atmosphere for it and like the color palette, that took some well you tried a bunch of tries there was one I think one that we we had for a while where it was toxic green and you could you couldn't see which part was gas and which part was oh yeah normal fog maybe not maybe we shouldn't do that yeah so but there's a little bit of an element now where like there's a bit of red towards yeah on green yeah more yellow maybe yeah it was a bit tricky to balance because obviously red and green are opposite but, I think I think we managed to do a pretty good job for that see if we can pull up the, teaser videos because I think I think the the the the swamp has like this one like during daytime got that cool blend yeah and it looks almost like it's kind of like a suffocatingly foggy kind of like it's really warm and moist there yeah humid yeah like definitely oh yeah don't use the word moist it's a prohibited word there some people find it unpleasant yeah and yeah during the like lighting and atmosphere stage, we did like encourage simon to go full out with like a bit more creepy creepy colors stuff like that yeah yeah so this I think it's the one before this yeah and the the ghostly at night thing was definitely already kind of there but it's so much more refined yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah we went for a bit more of an alien color palette because we felt it it it made it the area feel a little bit like uncomfortable like when you have some clashing colors yeah and what we have often in the game is like some blue plants and somehow red plants and green grass and those are all colors that usually don't play well together so we had to try using the light and the atmosphere to blend them all together and also tweaking existing materials it worked fine along the way but it it obviously would have been easier to start off from complete scratch with completely new assets but of course we we wanted to work with most mostly the assets we had yeah so I mean a lot of assets are are used and some assets are like, tweaked so like the dead trees that you see like there were we used like green trees where we removed the leaves and added some moss stuff like that yeah yeah those were made based on like the trees that exist and I just made them look dead I killed them, yeah and like pillows yeah they're rip willows I mean I they're still in my heart you know and I have an idea for them but who knows they might never come back no they might have a comeback they never were in my heart I'm going to yeah same shot I'm going to say I love willows well in real life obviously but not the willows we used to have no nothing they've been they actually went through so many iterations that we could never land on something anybody like everybody was happy with there was always somebody upset and it was like he could never I could never figure it out they're cursed yeah but yeah essentially the swamps idea was to be opposite of the starting areas that are a bit more welcoming a bit more building friendly and the swamp is kind of like more creepy more unpleasant yeah yeah and more like a challenge for the players to to explore yeah as a at the the point that players usually want to go into the swamp they will have equipment that they can at least deal with some of it yeah and if not they should probably leave and get it get get the nukes yeah yeah yeah yeah I think exactly yes I'm a bit bummed out that you didn't get the get to destroy the entire spark I mean you guys will have that chance yeah and I mean- I always have the power you know I could just destroy the whole world if I wanted to just take the entire tile and just believe just knowing I could does a lot for me it's yeah and then we don't version control anymore there's no way to get it back yeah there's there's a hole where the map is yes yes there is it's the old spy coast it's back so no factories have been broken so this is oh we're at five minutes left
