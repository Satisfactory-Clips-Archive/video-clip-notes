### Transcript

> i just want to kind of echo a little bit about the what we talked about earlier in the stream so update five when is that coming it's probably going to be later this year we're gonna be probably gonna be a fall release we haven't decided exactly yet what's gonna be in update five how big it's gonna be we initially thought that update 5 was going to be a little bit smaller update but then we kind of like when we were like moving things around schedule wise we realized like it doesn't make any sense to not have this maybe here, so we we've we're moving things around we still haven't decided exactly when, like not even like what month we're focusing on right now actually, because that's still a little bit up up in the air and we probably won't know for a while until we've like prototyped some ideas we have and see like how much more work we might need or if it makes sense
