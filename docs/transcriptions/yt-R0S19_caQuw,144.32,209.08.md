> Yeah. How will you fix rebalancing? So yeah we need to figure out a way that when we do balancing changes to the game you can still access your factories that you spent you know... 30... 40 hours on. We don't want you going to refactor them unless you really want to. And so our idea right now is that for any any balancing change that comes out that could risk uhm ruining your factory, we will store a different version of the game in some way we'll make it accessible to you so that you can keep playing on the same version on your same factory. However, that does mean you won't be able to get updates unless you're willing to refactor your factory. This all still kind of sucks. This is probably the best way for us to do it. But at the same time we have to make these changes because the game is Early Access and we need it to get better. So... you know we can't just get it right the first time. We need to be able to fix it and, again, this is limited to things that will... rebalance or affect your factory. Anything like bug fixes or whatever, we're not gonna just put a whole new version out for that. But in any case, we will fix it. We must fix it. It's very, very important that we fix this.
