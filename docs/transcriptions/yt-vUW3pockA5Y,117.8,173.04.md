> I'm concerned about... all of it. I mean, it's a huge project and there is so many things interacting. I mean I'm still not happy with it, we wanna not only create opportunities for players to ultimate things, but also want to create challenges. For example there is the reinforced steel plate, to get enough screws you gotta go one and a half structures. And that setup.. obviously you can't just build one, or you can build one, if you overclock it, or you can build several. We wanna find these places where we can make things a little bit off. They go together, if you figure it out, it's sort of like a mini puzzle. If you play singleplayer you have to do everything yourself. If you play multiplayer then maybe you only build and you never go out and explore. And thats fine, some people like that.
