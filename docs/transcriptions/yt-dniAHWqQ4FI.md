### Transcript

> foreign but I don't know if that's actually true or not you can't you can't hand out hang out for, the the 50 minutes where I give a quick state of Dev, of the game Crash cool did it wait oh this is an interesting crash actually state of Dev is if you guys didn't see the video I put out last week, where I essentially said that, what did I say in that video that was mostly like a wrap-up video of information for people that may have not have been hanging out on the streams and see what's what's you know what's what's the happening I think that video will put like a lot of information around like you know if you have mods installed in the the game crashes then usually what happens when we update the game is that mods need to also be updated and before they are they do that they crash so a lot of crash reports actually like almost nine out of ten of people that reached out to me, the first week like they they were having issues with mods so like it was quite easy to resolve those issues, I think some of the mods have been updated now so, so, yeah should be good now and if you're still getting crashes and you you have like the little like indicators that's like it's using mods, then it might be the mod that's causing the crash, or maybe not but it's good to like at least like disable mods to verify that it is the mod crashing or not, and if the game is crashing and you get the crash reporter you only need really need to hit send or restart, if you type in like a little like what you were doing that also helps us a lot there was actually one crash that we couldn't figure out what the hell was going on and then somebody left a little message saying like, I dismantled the thing and we're like oh it's this thing and then we figured out so that's really helpful, for everything else that's not crash related, check out the QA site yada yada you guys already know this, if you frequent the streams so that but that was mostly what the video took up one thing that the video brought up that I don't think I mentioned last week was that Update 7 is what we're calling the next update, it's also going to be a small update working time great title working title, we said that last time as well but it turned out to be up to six anyways, yeah so Update 7 is going to be a smaller update it's going to be probably smaller than update six, for a couple of reasons that we will probably dive into more as we figure out what we put into update 7., update 6.9 oh it's not gonna happen we should have done that, still time so and, yeah we're still sort of figuring out what to do with update seven one thing that we do what we know at this point is that we want to put in like a bunch of extra stuff that we couldn't finish for previous updates so there was a bunch of creatures software update six we couldn't finish we want to put that in, I think there was something else from like update four or five as well that we just haven't been like been able to finish and wrap up that we also want to fix, there's probably going to be a bunch of bug fixes as well some of the common ah snap my finger, a bunch of bug fixes that we you know we always every every update we try to like grab as much as like the the most requested fixes that are not like major system reworks, and try to fix that so there's probably gonna be a bunch of that and there's a couple of goodies here and there as well new things that we haven't shown yet that we also think are going to make it into update seven but we have to sort of, I mean we'll talk about that as as the the the video's role because we need to sort of clarify for ourselves that we can commit to these things, but I think we're going to be able to show some things pretty soon actually because some things are more finished than others, because like I said while we've been working on update six we've also broken other stuff some some of that stuff were happening while we're working up at six so like some some things are actually more in progress yeah that's like a lot of stuff across all the updates that we did right where, yeah some things just had to get cut right yeah but like a lot of the updates that we did there's always like a theme to it right so it's like we want these certain things in there because they fit with the overall theme of the update and then so sometimes like the things that got dropped from before never really made into the next one because it didn't work it wasn't in line with the rest of the other stuff that, you know that would be themed so we need to somehow move them out closer hello everybody yeah, something something, theme of the update something something because for instance the, like for update six for instance we managed to get into half foundations that was stuff that we were originally gonna do for update five but we just didn't didn't have time to fully wrap it up and then at the time when update 5 was like wrapping up we were like all right we're gonna move on to other things because we need to finish this and that has like requirements of the people that are working on the the founder the foundation stuff so that they had to like drop that for a bit and come back to it later and there's been a few other things like that, and like you just said like the the it also like the systems that I touch it makes more sense like finish these things before we wrap up these other things, so yeah more more stuff is coming there's some like I said there's some new stuff that we haven't shown yet that we're working on, so yeah essentially more news soon I think yeah soon oh yeah anyways I've stolen as much as I can yeah yeah I don't know I don't know maybe we won't be at it we might end up missing it because it keeps getting delayed a little bit awesome they gotta hurry up but like we're only live for another yeah that's right so we'll see if there's a if there's anything specific you guys want to see, as well like don't forget to upload on the QA site of course, I mean at this point we kind of need to to put the foot out and be like this is the stuff we're doing so we can actually make it for update seven but you know we're always looking at the Q website, as I mentioned in the video I think as well please remember that we do read everything in the Kiwi side we're not able to respond to everything on the QSI because there's a lot of stuff happening, but please remember that we do read everything so it is very very useful to see, posts as well and please make sure to search and see if somebody's already like submitted a bug that you found yeah or add more information to it if you have more data like related to a bug if somebody posted something and you have you know more information or maybe a save file even that makes it easy to reproduce these issues so, so yeah I think that's going to be state of Dev for today short and sweet nice short and sweet q a I haven't been I haven't been around me neither I mean, wait just like mentally check out like q a start no yeah we managed to get in the new corner pieces and like that stuff, for for update six, which was also like something that kind of happened last second, and then we were like oh maybe we should we didn't make it but yeah we we did it after EA release so we'll see
