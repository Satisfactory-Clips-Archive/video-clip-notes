### Transcript

> are you both more focused on bug fixes or game expansion we're community managers the two of us and so we actually don't do any bug fixes or expanding the game we just do uh you know streams like this talk to people uh help people out make videos things like that we used to be programmers on the game but uh yeah we now do this but if you mean you as in us as a company then we're kind of doing both actually right now we're both working on fixing the issues that exist and we're also looking into what we're doing next sort of at the same time and that's mostly because like not everyone can work on the same thing at the same time um like you know if you're a concept artist you can't really like work on concept art to fix patches you know like so it makes sense for you to start looking into like all right concert art for the next face i'm like starting to work with that um so we're doing a bit both this is also why like sometimes our it takes so long to get patches out because it's such a tricky situation to get everyone working on the right thing
