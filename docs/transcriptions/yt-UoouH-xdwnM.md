> do not check out java unless you want to cry okay c sharp is probably the better option there actually i i i revert my statement because he showed up a lot yeah yeah has way better documentation than java java is very tricky to learn you could also like learn c sharp with unity because i think unity is pretty that is true yeah uh beginner friendly because cause because like like learning a programming language is one thing learning how to actually make games is a different thing so like for example someone said do we use blueprints or c plus we use both it depends like depending on who is using what and what it's going to be used for and some things are done in blueprint first and then nativized later for speed but like the reason why blueprint exists is because sometimes the language can be daunting or a little bit hard to get into when what you want to do is like just make games right so the logic of how things work in a game engine how do you make a model move or whatever that stuff is language independent it doesn't matter if you're using blueprints or language for that you just need to know what the process is like the language is just sort of the vessel to get you from a to b yes so you need to know what you want to do before you can use a language exactly and that that is tricky like figuring that out just start with assembly yeah
