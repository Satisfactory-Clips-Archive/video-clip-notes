> does CSS intentionally don't want to make game very complex, the game is very complex what are you talking about the game is very complex, but the thing with games is as they get complex whenever you add something else it gets exponentially harder to add something because when you add something it interacts with everything else both like technically wise and like crashes and stability wise but also game design wise like when you're gonna make when you're going to add something to a game you want you want to get the most value out of what you add in the time that you spend making something, and whenever you do that you need to see how does it interact with everything else it's not it's generally speaking not really great good design to just add random things that have nothing to do with anything else in a game whenever you add something you want it to affect the other things in the game as well, and yeah and so just adding random things and and having needless complexity is counterproductive slows you down immensely it's incredibly bug prone, yeah it's just not you need to be you need to be careful, yeah so whenever adding complexity you need to be super super deliberate about what you're doing and super aware of what you're doing otherwise things get out of hand really quickly and your game never ends it just gets worse
