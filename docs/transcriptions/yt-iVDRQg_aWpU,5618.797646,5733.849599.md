> will there be updates on experimental uh yes so the way i think we're gonna we're gonna like or rather the way that it usually works is that experimental you know the way when we push out builds or patches or whatever they go in a certain order right so first we make it our internal then we put it on like a little stage where only selectfu can access that's just mainly testers and then we put on experimental and then we put on an ea and it goes through that order almost every patch almost so you know now that we put out stuff on early access we might still put some stuff on experimental that we're testing that are maybe like more risky bug fixes if you will or like system changes or something that will like potentially solve issues but maybe we're not sure or something like that that will still happen on experimental so those two will still kind of like run in parallel for a bit um and then when we feel like yeah it was a good patch let's move it over from experiment to ea so like that whole process will still be ongoing albeit a little bit smaller like increments now than a month or whatever uh it's gonna be much quicker um because i know there are a few things that we want to try out that we're going to put on experimental first um with uh not not like new features but like some some things where like we can potentially solve some issues with some folks but we it's like too risky to roll them out on on on the branch that we have right now because we feel like it's quite stable honestly so we want to put that on early access first before we do stuff like that um so if you haven't played an experimental and you kind of like all right i've been on experimental i i i'm trying out the new things but now i want to play on a stable version then i would reque uh recommend moving over to early access um just so that you don't get like a weird issue or something if we're testing something else and that bothers you but if you want to help us try out stuff then stay on an experimental just before just ask before uh will it be update 6 next or 1.0 who
