### Transcript

> these foundations and frames and pillows to design my own rail supports i didn't need for something else added yeah see like because if we were to add the support then it would be like uh like would we add it in the same way that it's like you kind of have to require that the support is there to build the track but the track should just be on the ground um but we could add train support pieces or something like that so that just looks special for trains but then we could always use the pillar base and stuff like that to just make it i don't know i feel like you can make your impellers right now
