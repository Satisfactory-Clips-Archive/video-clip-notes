> Community manager I just want to say another huge thank you for another amazing year of support that you guys have shown us constant support and not just the support that you show us but like the support that you just show to the community in general so like whether you're a streamer whether you like work on mods or you create tools or just hanging out in Discord making memes sharing screenshots on Reddit whatever all of that stuff really comes together and makes the community what it is which is really, an amazing thing one of the best if not the best in games in my opinion hot take so just want to really express my appreciation and gratitude to you all for that for another year and then also just a kind of cute little video that we put together here to show you that everyone at the studio also really appreciates it too so I hope, I hope you kind of enjoyed this kind of random video that I put together
