> will it run on the steam deck it does run on the steam deck but since we don't have full control support and some of the ui scaling doesn't work on, the resolution that the steam deck is running at so we're not like fully supported like if it was like verified or whatever it's called, it does work and there are workarounds for the controller, people can use god I keep forgetting what it's called like you can download the the wrapper thingy, whatever you call the the control thingy handler, somebody made like a way to to map the controller so you can use that it kind of works it's not an on-screen keyboard it's it's like a controller map thingy that I can't remember what's called if you if you search like steam controller satisfactory or something like that I think you get a hit immediately, steam inputs yeah it's it's like part of that right so there's like a just like a special file you can put in and then it will map like certain commands it's so it works okay, but it's not perfect just like me profi yeah I kind of like a profile yeah I like downloading more ram no it's much cooler
