> hi hello everyone so we are live so I'm just gonna show you pretty much my routine as I level design and hopefully it'll Entertain You hopefully it'll show you that my job can be a lot more boring than you think hi chat alright so if you have any questions if you want to know anything about my job what I do and really anything that you want to ask I can't promise I can't answer but I will try to answer yep and that's it I'm gonna show you a little bit of what I do for example today I've been working on caves for a little bit and they've been well it's kind of a new thing where we have hold on gonna up the mic a little bit let's see here it's - how about this is this better oh yeah this is Unreal Engine from where where I'm from I'm from the Netherlands that's where I studied as well and I moved here for coffee stain for this job specifically under order gameplay as of now that is not really a thing but who knows maybe in the future all right what's the glowing ball well you'll have to play the game to find that one out all right so I've been working on decorating Caves specifically where I put stuff like stalagmites static tights some lights things like roots coming from the roof stuff like that like I had just done in this cave this is a cave that I have just finished at least for now so I'll be moving on to an another one can I swim well that depends me personally or in the game because it might be a different question how many Dutch people we have three and we'll get another one soon yes we have kids and this I'm gonna show you a little sneak peek if we go up is in an area called rocky desert you can see a little bit more of the game and I'm just gonna teleport us over to a cave that needs decorating this one empty completely so let's make it pretty alright so I have a bunch of foliage types that we call them here on my left and these are essentially things that I can use to decorate the level with so for example I'm currently using a lot of this row which has cave assets in it so for example there were mushrooms that I had used before but I'm going to start with some stalactites and paint those on the ceiling different biomes contain different resources not really foliage is a thing but different biomes don't necessarily have different resources but there might be by biomes that work better for certain resources so you might find some assets that relate to that around there and yes there are definitely Easter eggs in the game of course we love putting those in and I won't tell you about them because that's kind of defeats the purpose will you be able to use the map editor no this is an engine so an engine is not something that you can use as you play but maybe in the future that will be a thing depending also how much we want to go with mods and stuff what what do we make the foliage and the models in program wise not entirely sure I think we use Maya for one of our tools and we probably use I was it called there was a program that could create trees of some kind that was specifically very good at organic shapes I am if you are in the Alpha right now the caves are kind of broken we fixed them though that's a big thing that we're doing so if you get stuck in them now hopefully in the future you won't get stuck in them again SpeedTree yes that's it SpeedTree ZBrush could be I think maybe I would have to ask the artists yes don't try it try not to anger Simon too much you know you might sneak up on me and scare the crap out of me or I don't know steal my key that'd be a bad thing ooh substance painter is a thing as well yeah and ZBrush confirmed just got a message that's not like right does it fit nicely so yeah we use substance painter all right let's try to scale you down ackee our caves a hazard or will they just be there to explore that depends on the cave but they are definitely an exploration thing and there will probably be nice goodies in there to be found what engine this is Unreal Engine that's so that the stalagmites since that they're going I know the point of going into caves besides exploration while you can find stuff like these little guys nice little goodies that will help you in some shape or form whether that be factory related or exploration related otherwise it's also it could sometimes find resources you can find oh that's a little very big let's tone that down and just nice little areas sometimes we just make caves for the sake of having a pretty little corner of the world to to see and enjoy let's see this scale no that's wrong that one skill ten let's turn it down to six maybe five this is a very low ceiling

> the specs of the PC I'm working on honestly hey you don't know but it's a pretty good one who creates the decorations and assets well that would be our lovely art team they are the Wizards that make all all of the things that I use to put inside the level so I cannot take credit for any of the actual meshes that you see on the screen but I can take credit of like where their place mostly see how many people are we in the studio we're about we're getting some new people in soon I think we'll be around 30 we've just today we've been redecorating and we essentially a new seating plan was made and we got a bunch of new desks and we've been moving things around a lot today including me I'm in a new spot now so it's cozy see if we can fit some in this narrow passageway it'll make them a little smaller again doesn't really work nicely are these stalactite scientifically accurately placed I guess I can go into a little bit of like how we decide where to put things and how the world looks a lot of it is actually research into geology and a lot of times I actually consulted Google Maps or something like that to sort of see okay how does how does the world work pattern wise because it's all about patterns in nature and yeah usually you'd have stalagmites hanging directly over stalagmites and stuff because they Selig mites essentially help create static no static tight help create static mites it's always confusing which ones up and which ones down yeah but yeah I used Google Earth just to sort of see what nature is up to honestly and there was a study that was done here as well for how erosion works for example how water erodes rock and earth and such and how rivers are created and lakes and anything and how all these things are connected and so that there is thought that goes behind this creation but at some point we also take some creative freedom where we take what is pretty over what makes sense because well you know what this game to be pretty yeah exactly start tights hanging down I I see you Jonas I see you I have that I have that trick as well but if you want the safe for work version it's the stalactites as in top if that helps anyone there you go yep Tim Tim got it too

> all right let's see do we have any foliage above this no but this is where faking comes in let's add some roots hanging from the ceiling the most ridiculous thing I could show you I have a little thing I could sure you and let's see where it is again it's over there somewhere in this mist there's a little thing I think some people could appreciate let's go back to our cave
>
> [Music]
>
> we're not using the same assets as Ark as far as I know but they're also we have some temporary assets that we use until but our team can make make essentially the acid that we need let's go turn off the lighting so I can see a little better
>
> [Music]
>
> No No please don't reward Simon for scaring me that's not a good thing yeah you shouldn't have that's not okay what is my job in the franchise well as the title hopefully hopefully says level designer but I also worked on writing the story and recently I've been doing some lighting which ties pretty tightly into level design so most of that is most of what I do a pipe big enough to drive a car in would you call that pipe maybe of cave tunnel because we have was he building caves well you could try it's a cramped space but you know I won't stop you it could be pretty cool okay let's see yeah this is it's not a desert your we're under a waterfall it's fine if there's a route screwing here don't don't come up with logic keys this is a cave of anything to do with story well no story spoilers here let's add some color this year sure what the Simon do well he mostly delays things unless you want a serious answer but do a serious answer do you really want the magic to be gone do I have rules to follow while decorating it's mostly stuff that's in our head we don't we follow some rules as I said before where we try to be somewhat logical with how we place things let's actually make the spawning of this unless let's make that 10 and there's more arts-based rules that's where for example things look best in clusters evenly spaced out looks too perfect too painted essentially too deliberate where if we paint things in clusters and if they are a little chaotic that's the best tends to look better for example it's more of just a generic art rule and level design rule I suppose things rules definitely for example we don't want to block the player too much like if I would you know put some annoying rocks here the player wouldn't have a nice walkway to get into the cave so we have to be careful with how we how we place things and that the player doesn't have stuff from the perspective of the player it's about a yay big so it's very deceptive actually it's a big problem when level designing especially when you're doing the big strokes because you sort of need to put out player like the player model just to have a sense of scale because everything looks a lot smaller than it actually is

> can you travel to other planets we are currently just on this planet
>

> doesn't want to paint put it the angle we need to give it at coldest things otherwise it will just stay on the screen forever because it's smaller well that gigantic rock is pretty gigantic but you can pass by it so it doesn't actually block the players path sure I can I can pop down a player model hold on let's see static mesh that is not what I want let's see what is it called well it's not a story spoiler to say that there's not gonna be in another planet it's just giving you a sense of the scale of the game chart player got you and it's probably a blueprint not a static question there we go okay so that's how big the player actually is so that you can see that things look a lot smaller than they actually are and there you can sort of see like a small camera perspective from what the player can't see from that point I do not know how big the world is in football fields but it's about 30 by 30 kilometers so that's pretty big all right I'll delete that yeah I totally build a factory in here yeah we just saw one but you could totally try I welcome I welcome those who who can figure that out because it's it's gonna be challenge but do it absolutely send us screenshots we'd love to see the stuff that you do people have already made amazing stuff in the Alpha it's amazing is the world a single landscape or separate ones I'm not sure what you mean if you mean if there will be stuff like look like loading screens between areas no there won't be it's all like fluid open world and it's just one big map the level designs me well that's it that's that's an interesting thought probably like twice as big as the player
>
> [Music]
>
> but logic do we use to split up assets and sub levels that's a good question we have a rule of where we use about 15 oh I did sorry retracting a previous statement the 30 by 30 kilometers that's a that's a leftover of when we first announced the game and a lot of people actually thought it was that big must've sneaked into my brain there it's 30 kilometers squared yeah here we go so like about five five and a half by five and half as firm they're like the acid limits real set it's yeah about 15 15 assets for biome or area so there's about 15 assets that we can use for caves and there's about 15 assets for example that we use for deserts and there's about 15 assets we use for forests and we mix and match those where we have sub areas within like a bigger biome come on where's your painting let's increase the pizza now that one's in the rock let's not be tomorrow let's just go to the I see it's a collision
>
> [Music]
>
> cave-dwelling creatures only one way to find out those who do this or not
>
> [Music]
>
> but there's definitely stuff roaming around the planet that isn't all too friendly towards you and stuff that might be very friendly towards you as for the question of why we chose Hugh's manual building of the levels instead of procedural generation I'm not entirely sure because I wasn't there for that decision process but I think the idea was that procedural generation at the time seemed to be a lot more effort for the work that we're putting into may be retroactive Lee we can say that it could have been better but honestly we're we're managing pretty fine I'm also I'm not the only level design designer we have vistas as well who was here long before I was here and I came in to help out and we've been going for about two years now so and so far we've been managing pretty well and we have two two others specifically one of the other designers that helps place about things like the resources and the creatures and all the all the fun stuff you can do and like jump puzzles and all the all the other stuff that we can't be bothered with because we're trying to make things pretty
>
> [Music]
>
> I don't really work on gameplay blueprints no it's mostly I mostly do visual work and writing work how do you decide who feels kids with stuff well it's mostly we just see who's available and who can work in what area of the map at any point because we have we work with tiles so we have for example here a bunch of tiles and each tile will have to be essentially you can possess only one person can possess the tile at any one point so we have to really coordinate who works where at any point so right now I have the tiles for the rocky desert which says that I will if there is anything to do in that area I will be the one to do it and we can switch around tiles when we need to and give them to other people when something else needs to be built it's yeah it's a lot of tiles I haven't counted them but you're welcome to screen Jeff and try for me but yeah I think I think its tell I'm not sure exactly what the size of each tile is in meters but there's my people you probably know graphical modeling like different texture packs maybe I don't know we're really just focused on release and and and trying to figure out you know how to make this game like the foundation make it work and you know make it fun as it is and then we'll think about making extras and making it bigger and all those kind of things why not make a maze out of the caves who says some caves aren't mazes no could you show the whole world please if I load the whole world will be sitting here for like half an hour please no let's see it's switch over to in this do I have orange plants to put in the cave that is an oddly specific question I mean we have orange plants but whether they go in caves our graphics rendered in tiles yes that's exactly why we have this tile system so not all the tiles are loaded at at any point in playing the game so it's easier on people's systems and make this one it's pretty small in itself oh I'll just fix up the stalactites in this cave and then we'll move on to your another area and you'll be able to see a bit more of the map again there we go it's a little too much can I put something in this cave to make it easy to identify well try to fine it from from the screenshot make it a treasure amount I don't know this is where it is also those beautiful waterfalls that haven't been fixed yet speak more for these yeah all the elbe a little patience and I'll be showing the tile and second just
>

> it's still extreme it's actually kind of annoying to paint on the ceiling because of how the camera works and my brain doesn't always catch up with the perspective
>
> [Music]
>
> well water effect items on the belts it would be cool if they got like a shine or like a new texture or maybe maybe I don't think it's in right now but maybe
>

> if I reverse the camera to make it look like I'm working on the floor I will be incredibly disoriented when I go outside of the cave probably I think the stream will be about an hour depending on how
>
> [Music]
>
> when I run out of things to say I guess he thinks the show but probably until about like 5:00 p.m. our time so another half an hour or so okay let's see how this looks with late it's a little dark so let's add it's not too dark but when the night falls
>
> [Music]
>
> and it gets pretty dark so let's add some lights am I in the right title hold on I will have to check and I can check by clicking this I'm x1 y3 so let's see that's not the one I have selected sift it click there it's selected and everything I place into it will be in that Thailand will be loaded with that tile foliage automatically does this because it's painted on the tile itself so that's very handy let's see details the situation can go a little wider and if we make it darker let's make it a little bluish to make them a bit more cave like I suppose and then make it more intense let's see just some ambient lighting so that it can be able you're able to sort of see where you were at but there's also flashlights so hopefully it won't be too bad and I'll just make this one Knicely highlight it
>
> [Music]
>
> copy this one over to here and now the cave has a little bit of ambient lighting so you can actually sort of see what are you doing it's a fairly rough concept will be probably doing another pass when we let me just save everything I'll do another pass when we have all the assets exactly as we want them and a better idea of exactly what wouldn't want to do with caves because caves are a fairly recent development are twice because they've been in the game for a while but we haven't really had a good asset set for them so this is all actually fairly new for me I've only really started doing this today all right let's get a little glimpse of the outside when there's night as well is there lava if you dig deep enough I guess I don't think there will be lava but yeah this is an idea of what the world looks like we've done a lot of were work on the perimeter so like the skybox that clouds the lighting the mountains in the distance so that's all been fairly new this area in particular rocky desert if you watch the previous stuff stream deserts are kind of my thing so I've worked a lot on this area and also the other desert which probably won't be shown today but is in the game so yeah let's see where the next cave is and let's put it back to mid-day there we go light let's see let's find the cave let's see we've done this now this is a cave thingy this one might be interesting it's a bigger one it's fairly open and do 30 or I think that was a pretty interesting one that one isn't in a tile that I can't get to yet here we go so this is sort of like a transition cave like underneath the level we all have internal names for all the areas but just so that we know what we're talking about we're like I'm working on the dune desert or I'm working on the rocky desert working on these canyons or working on the southern forests started in northern forests so we can actually know where people are talking how many suns and moons planets this planet have but
>
> [Music]
>
> let's see let's start again would be selecting you actually it's good maybe to start with the static might because they will block the price if I'm not careful those names are mostly for internal purposes the the names of the the levels and such so I can't say there will be in the story but they might be probably I honestly don't think we'll use them it's more for internal communication I think work we're gonna give you the freedom to name things as you like so know this do I work with any astronomers or anything nope well we have some really smart people in the office that helped me with some sciency stuff mostly I do research I try to make things as believable it's both story wise and levels of wise but like for the story I am researching things like space and science and like alien planets and things like how how do how with this system work logically with multiple planets and such and and also just you know because there are the things you build need an explanation maybe sometimes or there's some lore behind it and I would be also the one to to write and research that and there are some things that don't exist in real life so that always turns interesting well the machinery still work if I'm not loading that specific tile yes your factory will always stay active no matter where you are on the map unless of course you run out of fuel but that's a problem to deal with more with management have you set up your factory yourself but of course we give you a warning when that happens I think yes some things don't exist yet in real life but who knows what the future brings could be that I know some inventor somewhere is inspired by our game and I don't make something stupid because why not how does the map and currently it's mostly just the endless void or see what we're doing a lot of perimeter work right now to make the the ending of the map look nice and feel nice and not just like invisible walls because there's anything that most people hate it's invisible walls and trust me that is a shared hatred so my work schedule my work schedules kind of like I it's just a nine-to-five job or kind of over an 8 to 5 job where we I just we have a breakout run 12 to 1 fun hour we usually go out for 4 for lunch with people from the office or people bring their own lunch and sometimes we play games sometimes together sometimes not sit during lunch break and it's just yeah like the kind of work I do really depends on the the day really and the planning because sometimes I work more on the level and sometimes I work more on the right thing depending on what we need for the next build or or what stage were at with certain features so writing is very difficult if features aren't complete because then essentially that turns a lot of writing obsolete so some things just have to wait and then I do other stuff in the meantime oh thanks sleepers delight also the guy whose music you're hearing currently good stuff what is my most favorite game oh no that is a terrible question to ask someone why do you do this I'm f I'm mostly of RPGs I play a lot of dungeon and Dragons both groups here but I play I'm a firm Bioware games lover I love these discrete series most anything that has roughly elements in it or exploration I'm a fan of exploration what would get my job it's pretty perfect see other stuff most I'm a kind of story for of these reasons I play overwatch for example
>

> they are that like more narrative driven games like like the strings or the telltale games but I also play stuff like Borderlands and do silly shooters I'm yeah I'm probably gonna play anthem I played the demo I think that was two weeks back and the gameplay is actually really cool I'm just so worried about the the hub stuff but it thankfully gives them time it'll be pretty cool but I mean honestly the the gameplay and the the navigation of the areas just flying around in a suit and really cool really cool did I make the walls of the cave you're placing stuff on now yes and no some caves are made by me some caves are made by marks and even a tiger says oh the lion in the ground that's because of the caves line it's essentially the line that it follows it's it's just a mesh but if we I can show you for example this isn't fees determines how the mesh flows and the numbers indicate which playing point were at so this is the first spline point or like there was also a zero that's the mouth of the cave and then there's this one and that way we can make more of these kind of almost tunnel like caves instead of having to mess around with a lot of separate meshes so this is a lot more optimized and a lot easier to work with as well all right I think I've missed some spots probably I get it a little distracted sometimes I can just paint some stalactite stare how is the rocket gonna look at something outside what's rocket I'm not sure what you're talking about what did I do to get into coffee-stained well I was studying game design in the Netherlands for a while and in my last year we did internships so at first I interned at Ubisoft and ma fuyi and then Natalie a really good friend of mine who I met in college was interning here and she was talking about how cool it was and how the people were awesome and that the work was cool and I figured out that I wasn't really too much for a triple-a development and I was looking for a different kind of workplace essentially so I was like okay and Natalie told me that they were looking for another designer so I applied as for an internship here and I got in and that's pretty much how how it all started so I I uh my my spot here - Natalie most likely because honestly coffee-stained wasn't really on my radar before I played goat simulator and I sort of vaguely knew about them but I didn't really know pay attention I guess but my eyes were opened see it's it sort of looks like a triple a game it's a very ambitious project I have to say like this is the biggest biggest game that coffee stains to you this is maybe yet it's pretty insane here and I think we're pretty much good on stalactites don't want to overdo it either all right requirements so far windows yes windows is a requirement we were we're probably gonna have different kinds of stuff like the platform we're currently using his windows just because it's the easiest for us to do at the moment cuz we're also we're not you know we're not done yet we're still in development but that that list will grow I'm very certain say something in French for the French community oh no don't fit this on me of a guard don't do this to me okay volume to the moon just Siana a MFC put to a jeep olympic on same as difficile toxicity city design it wasn't he my wallah there you go let's teach them to that you're welcome evil yeah baguette croissant etc oh no no don't ban me don't ban me I'm sorry I'll never do it again I'll speak English now say something a German no would you believe me if I can if I say I speak Francesc better than Germans just because I've spoken French more even though I'm that it's don't make me do this don't we be alright see can we make oh that's not good that's stalactites sticking out the other side well I think what is the biggest difference between working at an Indy CEO versus a major one but the biggest thing for me was versatility I really like doing different kinds of jobs like for example the fact that I do both lighting and writing and level design and sometimes even a little VFX but that's really on the side at a triple ace to you you don't really you specialize much more you go deeper into one skill and that is kind of the thing you do as an industry or you get a much more chance to just do all kinds of things and I just like too many things to really want to specialize in to one single thing all right let's see so that for me is really the biggest plus of working at an industry oh I also just like the fact that we're a smaller team and that means you know people better and you I know that there's just a more of a closer connection between people which is really really nice like the people here are amazing it's super cool I think let's see if there's anything we're missing it's a for realism steak there isn't a lot of plant life above this cave maybe a little bit here so I'm no roots maybe cuz it's it is a desert so I think we're good also but that one's floating but that is not for me to fix and that's also in a different level that I cannot touch right now so good luck mark do we deal with that who's my favorite member of coffee-stained I will not say this I'm not gonna pick favorites no no it's Natalie but I'm biased because anywhere along before I knew coffee stain no no I don't I did say that okay I move on nope the world is not generated it's every single thing that you see on this map is is hand placed and if you if you hate it then then you personally insult us and we will be crying from behind the scenes probably okay let's see it's not a kid that's not really interesting let's see oh right yeah this is the one I had worked on before this is well that's the underwater one that's not blocked that one out oh this looks interesting yeah we're based in Sweden we're in this little little town called Hebda in between the two big lakes it's still pretty south let's do one of the bigger ones let's try this one okay well enemies have Jace's hair this sounds like a mod that we need let's see let's let's paint some mushrooms first because this one has water where'd you go there you are this fountain is Jace's hair yeah it's blue that's what I mean this Simon worked in the basement in the cage we all wish he did we all do we all wish the edge of the map is currently mostly ocean or the eternal void that will swallow you whole so avoid well it's my favorite flavor of music oh boy oh boy it really depends on the mood but I use music a lot like I legitimate playlists for life I'm always looking for new music it's it's why I'm called DJ on the community discord because people listen long with me on Spotify sometimes it's pretty cool but yeah I managed to reach the Spotify song limit which it has apparently somehow did not know about it until I hit it but yeah that's the thing but I listen to a lot of indie folk but also like electronic music I listen to dubstep I listen to those two guys listen to rock Ellis to Punk trap whatever added to anything I listen to 30s jazz I listen to soundtracks a lot especially when I rights

> MOT support is something that we've been thinking about and that's been taken into accounts when when making the game from the start it's not something we've given a lot of attention to lately so it's not something that will be there immediately but we definitely want it in and the foundation for it is there but it is quite a lot of work to include that into the game and we just want the foundation finish that nine is very aggressive well you know learn from the best our producers German also the mighty nine if you know that I love you the world isn't randomly generated for bunch of reasons don't know all of them but one of them was that to actually make that program to randomly generate a world like this is also a lot of work and we'd still have to go in and fix things with right by hand and I have to check everything so it saves some work but it really depends on what the intention of the game is and what your level design team is like and such and the choice at the time was handmade mind we stuck to it is there are there big cliffs where you can see the entire map there are like Vista points where you can see like big points of the map and you can build up so you can make your own I will not be responsible for the amount of lag that you have though if you try to see the whole map at once if you have a good computer by all means but if you have another maybe it won't be as nice terrain it's essentially just essentially big meshes that we manipulate I can show you a little bit of what the terrain to looks like so if you manipulate terrain in itself in the tile we have essentially think of it as sculpting clay so we have these brushes that we can use for example sculpt in itself we can let's make this we can heighten terrain for example or we can lower terrain like that and we can also for example smooth things out so like to dull the edges of things and make it look a little bit more natural not as harsh flatten to sort of flatten down things like here this is just a rock floor so it doesn't really need anything too much I totally broke in and I'll smooth this edge now so this look is weird there we also have brushes like patterns we use that mostly when we're painting painting terrain such as the rock or the sand or the gravel so for example if we have some gravel I can use essentially patterns for example a nice whirly pattern to paint in different patterns as the name says like it says on the tin but mostly we use just a normal brush where we just sort of paint like you paint them on canvas essentially but the canvas is the world so poetic can I can you write down my name on this cave hold on let's write your name and grass alright bye bro there we go oh and it's gonna bake some textures look at that you're in the game man you're in the game and now you go because there's no place for grass here

> a little bit make it less stress I'm not gonna do all your names it's too much where and I can't get anything done today but you know you can write it in factory if you build your name that'd be pretty cool I would do that what was my first day at coffee stain like don't really remember per se I mean it's just mostly a lot of like played the game get familiar with it meet a whole bunch of new people it was nice it was just a wreck or old first day here static mites yes rights is the word there and we can use this one not to because the ground is flat well if you yeah if you start if you start here at the company the first thing you'll do is play satisfactory so that you know what you're working on would be kind of bad if you start working on something I had no idea what the game was like at all is there an undo button yes it's called control Z don't use it a lot because it makes things crushed sometimes or lag really intensely so it's right not to make mistakes and if we do it's panic or we just fix it the long way around we're still grass here that erasing is essentially I just hold shift and paint instead where do you apply there's the website the coffee-stained website itself you can always apply for a job if you think that you've got the the skills and they want to work in the games and with coffee-stained go ahead and do it we have open up open applications a kind of resolution I I'm not sure what the resolution is of our landscape tiles actually sorry can't answer that question not too sure I already told the story of how it became a level designer here at confident studios actually what's interesting is how I became a writer it comes to us because I was not hired as a writer at all essentially we were doing a bunch of internal testing and there was a lot of feedback of that context was missing like why are we building a factory what is happening how do we communicate to the players what to do and when to do it etc in a nice way that doesn't interrupt gameplay etc etc and I have been writing most of my life pretty much all my life ever since I could write I would write but it's something that I hadn't really done hadn't really pursued as a career in game dev because it's a notoriously difficult job to get into and it's an overly saturated market so I I just essentially kept it as a hobby on the side and then this problem came up here and I was like you know what I think I know what could fix this story so I made a pitch and presented it in front of the company and they were like yeah cool let's do it and that's how I became right here so that is all lighting done with a directional and skylight or do you have other lights new environment two caves have white lights because they just get really dark we have a yeah skylight we have like one virtual light which is like the Sun and as it arcs the light changes with it and the moon as well and that can all be affected by things like fog and post-processing volumes that we place all around the world as well it's possible to get chickens in the game alien chickens

> yes I studied to become a designer I didn't specifically study like level design or game design my study designer production like generally and I specialized according to my own tastes so I did a lot of the effects in my later years and level design was something that that I took to pretty nicely as well I was okay at there like puzzles and combat but I always made things too pretty and not as functional so this worked out when I think we've done with this ever folks is for now save again Maria I I studied in the Netherlands for just game development but specifically game design and production so is the world like Earth's so you can walk around it or will be they'll be an end I think of it more as an island that you're on it's not it doesn't go all the way around and there's there's edges as if he can't go past the the designated edge essentially so it's sort of like a very very big island can I speak Dutch yes but I've been warned before and I don't want to get fired or kicked from the stream okay see are y'all still enjoying ourselves this has been an hour it was crazy we are two level designers but there's there's a third who is kind of more like I guess you can call them more of a game designer because he designs stamp stuff like the encounters and puzzles and like the more gameplay oriented stuff in the level itself and Oscar for example does stuff like that too I believe but he gets real busy yep you're stuck in caves I'll assume that not look here a little bit of other stuff I actually don't have a lot of level design work to do besides cave at this point so and that way you don't get spoiled too much cuz you still want to just go out and explore and find out the world for yourselves and you know stuff like that it's what the games for what's school that I go to I went to an HDTV in Breda let's see see if there's any interesting cool ones in the Savannah that's too Krantz that's gonna be annoying that is an interesting one or maybe where are we in development well Alfa that's where we're at so definitely not finished yet but we have a very good idea of where we going oh this is interesting so maybe some really big star like tights could be cool yeah oh hey metal fest cool school buddies

> or the splines for oh these things that's for example these planes are indicators of where alien creatures would walk for example sort of like their designated area of where they roll around their patrol routes I guess you could say

> release date we know it's not gonna fail but how long does it usually take after sending up for the F to get response we don't have an automated response for the Alpha per se but if you signed up here in like like your your your input on the list there's no confirmation email but no worries oh just that's a little too big aren't we the aliens when we get yes we are technically we are the aliens when we get to this planet so fair point fair point these are native creatures let's call them that now yes still be nice to us though

> if I make alien chickens could you put it in the game sure I mean if mods are a thing that will definitely be something possible go big or go home

>
> the Alpha is pretty small small Wow clear players or it's smart to be a bit more irregular let's go crazy how do trees grow in caves they're special trees Oh God that's a lot of stalactite calm down

> we don't have a lot of players in the Alpha because we need to periodically essentially get feedback from people who play the game for the first time because we're changing the beginning a lot and how people learn if there's something missing and etc is very important for us to know and there's only one first impression that you can get Jase actually talked about this as well in the previous stream and we don't want to get too much feedback at once because then it will be hard to filter through and find what's the most valuable to us and what is the best priority for us to fix because that is a big question usually as well how will the story be told in the game rather be Audion lines or is this stuff a story very text-based both there will be there will be audio and there will be text the story will be told in a way that isn't in the way of the gameplay it's like it's supposed to be more of them like it's something that gives you context and if you want to dig deeper it's there but it's not in the way of people that just want to build factories and manage stuff and like don't care about what what else is going on so they could still be bigger so yeah think of it as as something that is there to sort of enhanced experience for those who want it and we're gonna make the story like subnautica not exactly I have played subnautica too much but it's inspired by stuff like subnautica portal is a big inspiration as well and love their humour let's see there was another one but it's not I haven't done a lot writing in a little while so it's escapes me right now but there are some inspirations that that I draw from and also just crazy science science is interesting and there's a lot of ideas to be gained from there so this obnoticus stories disaster I can't say I have no idea I haven't played the game really so I can't give an opinion on that can he climb steep terrain yes sometimes you'll need help but that help can be made it's alien the cake is a lie yes yes it is there is no cake in this game there's a food court though might be kick there Ceri essentially sculpting the environment I thought that was something environment artists were used to do is this part of the day-to-day work yes there's some overlap here some companies also use terms differently than others so what I'm doing can be considered environmental art but what we consider very much our coffee stain is the actual creation of the environmental assets and not the placing of them so level design is the placing of things and it really differs per company for example at Ubisoft this was environmental art what I'm doing now not level design it's really up to the lingo of internal systems really it's it's different for everyone but yeah we call it level design is the game of scam yes all of everything you see is fake it's not real it doesn't exist it's the figment of your imagination does this look good tell me this is look good I don't know hmm maybe it's just a texture that needs to be fixed to make it better for the trees I don't know there's a lot of that going around to like does this look good I don't know if I'm staring at it for like five hours see let's see okay too many tights on the right side could be good B I might revisit this cave we're gonna revisit this cave anyway as well I feel like this should be sparse or the bigger trees overlapped with psychos doesn't lucrative yeah no I'm gonna fix that at some point cuz overlapping never really looks good this is just kind of a rough try of like does it work hmm I'm not too sure about this one to be honest it works better in very confined environments you know what let's just pretend this games exist for a while cool there that is a glowy thing yes and the glowy thing is interesting because they do stuff here we go this is a big empty small cave skip the part where some stick through balcony roof Oh oops well I'll be fixing that it's okay no worries I begins the game in file size no idea no clue like ten ten units there we go this is better I have to go unlit though look now I can see them 10 the whole units yeah but we have Nordic language support or can the community do it afterwards yeah we're planning on having community community translations so essentially we'll be looking for people that are interested in helping us translate and do language QA in the community and hopefully translate the games that way so there will definitely be different languages that are available in this game for sure but community-driven if we can what is the ending don't ask her writer that that's a crime don't ask the writer how it ends No is my Unreal Engine pirated if it was that would be very stupid of me no of course not this yeah this is unlit mode so lit looks a little different and then we'll be doing like separate lighting and fog for the caves to make them look nicer as well right now they don't really have that too much because I'm reworking the system at this point so this is just so I can see what I'm doing because caves tend to be dark and I don't want to squint at the screen for too much Unreal Engine is free to use yeah right that was a thing though right that you can just use an unreal engine so if you're looking at the game to ever getting it so I just downloaded and try try things they have like really cool templates that you can just get like a quick start with and they have so many tutorials it's amazing honestly and if unreal seems a little bit too complicated for you at the start using NEC there are great for beginners alright let's do some might yeah I've worked in unity before as well it's a really great engine to start with when you're beginning because it's very it's like it it simple things are simple like it makes sense that way and on a tangent I feel like complicated things are simple but simple things are complicated so it's not it's not as of the smooth start for beginners not make that that big maybe but unreal does complicated stuff really well as well as I hear a bit more advanced it you've done real tends to be on the better side if you're trying like crazy things is this for got simile or nope this is for a satisfactory they could be bigger yeah they can be bigger let's make them ten have a fit mark there look well there we go maybe not that big though well I think do I take internship and gaming level design yeah we take in terms so if you feel like applying go ahead I was an intern before so you're satisfied by the look of the factory in satisfactory well that is satisfactory there we go fun done and over with we can move on now how long is the game gonna be for start to finish a few of few hours of finish the game and they took like hun'red or so hours I don't like the exact numbers but the game can be pretty damn long but yeah I think yes I when you can go to the bathroom or should I start wrapping this up because it's been like almost an hour and a half already unless you have some burning questions how about you go ask them now and I'll just have a nice view or something for you to see there or maybe I can show off a little bit a little bit of how fog works hold on and can you have your own pet in the game if you try hard enough they will love you this one unlock it so yeah ask your questions now because I'll be wrapping up the stream soon and I'll be paying attention to more questions at this point and I do a little gameplay when I studied in verdad did I I think I would work in this kind of break project I had no idea where I was gonna end up how things were gonna be I I was clueless let's see but yeah no no no gameplay don't have to but I'm looking for a thing I keep getting distracted stuff distracted me version control software do we use we use perforce what are the red dome things they are

>
> gameplay stuff around things yeah also if you want to blame someone for not sharing gameplay bleep Jase live days for everything if not blame Simon that's how it works okay do we have are we gonna make Easter eggs yes we will have Easter eggs in the game

> I'm totally gonna just make this right a little mini for later can i deform terrain no the terrain is not editable by the player it's more of a challenge of making your factory work with the terrain rather than against it right after do this and then I could split it so well the player to be able to make their own laps maybe that's something we'll look at in the future right now No so for example these tables here because sort of control the coloring and the density of the fog and stuff like that so we are currently at 12 in the afternoon what about snow in the games future if we ever do like a expansion or something where we do like add stuff to come up or make a new nap map maybe maybe that's the thing I don't know so is this a 12 how this is having multiple values okay so let's go crazy with color let's see we want to make this a little bit more yellow there we go or we can make it super yellow that that's maybe the beautiful thing thankfully yellow cuz it's the desert alright warmoth warming up a little bit yeah weather confirmed cuz of fog sure how BIG's the map it's about five and a half by five and a half kilometers so about thirty squared they pay me in coffee no they don't I don't drink coffee I'm I'm a blasphemer see and what if you want to make for example you want to change the color at 12:00 midnight when we go to 12 in the night we make it more more blue if it wants to work nope oh right it's this one hahaha there we go they pay me in foot long subs yeah that's how they pay me will they be Christmas New Year events or something like that when the game is finished not a clue not something we're really thinking about yet stuff like that we just want to get the game done first yep tea drinkers that's it let's see for example we want to make it bit more pale never come down or do we want to make it more maybe a lighter blue no that doesn't really work with the trees they're just doing something right now just to show you sort of what it what it's like there that's for example the color and how often will the map be updated again no idea what we're exactly gonna do with updates just want to get the game finished first but the map is still under construction for sure right now like fog height we can might go crazy if you want to or not you don't want to be too foggy it's a desert after all so you want to tone it down and it's something that we can change for example over time so twelve we want the fog to be like pretty much nothing so there we go then we got to get it back up for this copy this value over because the knight needs to meet each other and then we have a cycle I forgot to person enter there well the night cycle be dark so you need lights we have a flashlight in the game for a reason but we're still very much tweaking the lighting at this point so can't really give a difference of answer yes so now the fog if we change the night day night cycle will be less in the day and we're in the night and I think is this a game the kind of game that I wanted to design I didn't really have too much requirements I guess I actually prefer working on a game that I would not play than a game that I would play because then it doesn't get like spoiled for example video well coop be available from the certain earring axis that's that question what it'll be seasons new um think I think this about wraps it up so thank you for being here thank you for asking all these questions thank you for not having me have to answer to to terrible things and yeah I hope you enjoyed a little little sneak peek at what my routine is like what the what the level looks like in the editor for us and you know caves mostly caves but a little taste of the rocky desert as well and yeah thank you so much for being there and I hope you enjoyed it and that will be it bye bye I hope to see you next time
