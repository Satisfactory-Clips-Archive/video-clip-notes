> why is the station named omal in the main menu i actually don't know i think so the station names in the game are randomized between different station names that people at the studio have some kind of like relation to so obviously we have huevde which is where confiscating studios is based omol is another city in in sweden where i think i think someone is from omol or it might be a reference to a movie um that's called um normal and it's not about you know normal it's just like the general phrase right um so it might be that it might be a swedish reference there's a couple of swedish references in the game already and i think the intention is that the the train station in the menu is gonna also like switch names but i don't know if we ever got around to that um because a lot of other things were like more important um so um i don't know maybe we'll be home or maybe we'll like make change manually ikea yeah um so we'll see we'll see but that's that's the that's the story behind that right anyway
