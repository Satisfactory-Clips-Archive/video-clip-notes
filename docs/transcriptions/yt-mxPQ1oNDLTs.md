> so let me just recap real quick from from this theme post here so some things that we've sort of like we've confirmed that this is gonna happen at some point to the game to quote our producer burke like, this is specifically in regards to the first one but some one thing that we've sort of confirmed that this is going to happen at some point it's signs like we're going to release signs of the game at some point before 1.0 to quote producer burke i can't see the main game like without science in it so like signs are going to happen at some point, and train collision and signaling system is also something that we've announced since we released trains that trains are like in work in progress we're not completely done with trains we're gonna revisit at some point and the thing we want to implement for trains is train collision and signaling system, i believe both pretty sure both and, when that happens we don't know for sure, but that that's sort of something that we've confirmed in the past that we're gonna do, and another thing that we've confirmed a couple of times on stream on videos et cetera et cetera is that we're gonna have like different game modes to the game so we're gonna have like you know i don't know exactly which game was those entail and what order but you know sort of game modes like peaceful mode or creative mode and stuff like that so that's also gonna happen at some point, and then we're also gonna keep working on the world like the world updates which we've confirmed one world update is coming up day five there's probably gonna be more world updates if you wanna let me find a link to that if you wanna know more about this because i think this is a really good resource actually if you wanna know more about like what's going on in the world updates, and sort of you know what areas are affected and, you know if i built my base here will be affected check out this youtube video that jace made, it's got like this map two maps i believe or maybe three maps, where we sort of show off let me see if i can pull this on a stream maybe, we sort of show off

> that's me distracting you guys, let's see so so like here's one method i think this is the changes for update five so like these are the areas that are sort of affected in update 5 specifically, so northern forests were confirmed and then dune desert is also getting a little bit of a rework and some areas you can see the areas in red here those are areas where the terrain will change a little bit i think so like in the northern forest and in the most part of doing desert the the the environment won't change a lot like it will also be like new foliage and stuff like that so you know if you place foundations on the ground then there won't be any change there but in the red areas there is like there's some significant change to like maybe the landscape, so one example in this video is that chase showcases let me see if i can find that there's like a big crater, in the dude is it that's coming and like the nodes that are are there are gonna be there they're gonna be in the same place so like even if you place down like a, a reason a minor there that mine is still gonna function it's gonna be all there but if you built like foundations over this then you've built foundations and there's another map let me see if i can find that too maybe this is the first one he shows whatever check out that video there's another map where it shows like like up until 1.0 like the plans we have so yes that's that's
