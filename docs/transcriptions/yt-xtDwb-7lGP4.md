> pipes simulate viscosity, yes they do, because different yeah because different, fluid types have different viscosities so, wait one more yeah so for instance oil has a different viscosity than water so they actually behave differently, I don't know but it's cool but it's hard to to I don't think same same thing go there like you don't really see that and I think like when you play you may not not even notice it so like yeah they do behave differently but like not necessarily so that it's obvious that they do, unless we got rid of that but that's the that's the, I remember that that was something we did implement at some point around update three so unless we changed it since update three but I don't think we've touched pipe since update three I think we've, I haven't done any major changes to them slosh and backflow is notably different like between the updates or oh you mean between the fluids yeah because it doesn't backflow as much like water backflows a lot more than oil does, yes I love it people just say that do you mean this thing thinks this thing yes
