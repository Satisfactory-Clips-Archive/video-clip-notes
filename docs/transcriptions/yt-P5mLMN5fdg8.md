> when is jay's coming back I actually don't exactly know sometime in may I believe because jayce took out of extended vacation, because we all have like in sweden we have at least you know five weeks paid vacation by law and most people take most of those like all those weeks out like during the summer so like during july august something like that the studio is kind of like closed down almost and jace took out his vacation early but I think also jase took like a longer leave as well because jesus usually takes like a short vacation, just like a few weeks or so and he wanted to take a longer one this time
