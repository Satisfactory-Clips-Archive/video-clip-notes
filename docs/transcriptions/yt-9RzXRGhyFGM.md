> how do you exactly start with coding games College just free time so I have I have never had any, formal game developments, education I did computer graphics as part of my computer science degree and that's sort of where that interest started for me and then well I always wanted to be a Game Dev but I always thought it was too hard so I never like pursued it and then I started doing computer graphics and then I got interested in like compute like game engine architecture and then I randomly got a job, and that's how that's it's so Random how I got into Game Dev actually like I have- I like started pursuing it like right as I got a job in it and it was just like on on luck

> sorry I didn't want I didn't want to go to Game Dev because gamedev seemed too hard so anyway I got interest in game engine architecture I mean it's still interesting

>, but like as a kid I never I was never like oh I'm gonna make games when I grew up because I was I was I always heard it was so difficult which it is I think it's a lot better now though because when I started making games you didn't have Unity Unreal Engine was close engine, the only thing the only resource really had was like make opengl, stuff which is like so much work so like unless you were making basic ass 2D games you know it was there is a hefty, starting point but I did make my own engine and- I did make you know essentially what you get when you use Unity or Unreal Engine like you I coded my own shading Pipeline and like made my own shading language and, that all that opengl is easy try getting a Vulcan app gone no open jail is not easy and Vulcan is even harder foreign is very young I think that's very important to remember Vulcan the Vulcan API is super young like it's it's basically just born and it's it's intended for people that already know shading land like already know shading pipeline stuff like that yeah
