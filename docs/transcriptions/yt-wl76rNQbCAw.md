> the drone terrain avoidance be fixed in update six, I think so because I think the reason why we stopped or like we didn't wanna fix of update five was because we knew the spire coast was gonna change, some part parts of that bug was like because of something we need to do on the actual like map there's apparently more to that bug than just that so but we are looking into that one when we get around to it essentially there's there's there's a lot of bugs on our list and a lot of people want us to fix many different things so, I guess that goes in general like a lot of people ask like when you're gonna fix this specific bug and the answer to most of those questions is usually when we get around to it because there are so many different issues that people want us to fix and, drone bug drone port thingy being one of them I mean there's a bunch of issues with drones that we want to fix, so it all comes boils down to like when we get around to that particular fix which is just like depends how long it takes to fix all the other bugs essentially yeah like gas masking vehicles exactly that's another you know when we get around to it essentially you fix the bug we can't be motivated to make pretty trains that's never happening hannah says no on that one too yeah
