> if i had to guess i think trains are going to behave sort of similar to how they did with land before, but they will collide with other trains i, first i'm guessing, i think the thing we want to get in is collision without the trains and like signaling so that you have you know you need to manage your your training lines in a different way i don't think we care too much about like clipping with the environment like it's a similar thing with like conveyor belts like that if we need to fix the clipping issues with the trails, the trains in in the terrain with the trains train lines then why aren't we fixing it for the conveyor belts you know so and the conveyor belts are like kind of an active choice that we don't want to like overdo or limit like what you can do with the game so like if clipping annoys you then you won't clip you know you won't build your factory's clipping and if you don't mind clipping, and also you get like a little bit more freedom then clipping is is enabled sort of or available to you, so i think that's sort of the approach that we're going to take with trains as well no i can't say for sure because we haven't reached that point where we've made a decision on that because we need to work on it first but so yeah that's that's i think that's my take on that as right now there will be train signals yes at some point there will be train signals
