> will the rebar shotgun come back what I don't even know what that is is that a bug did we ever have a rebar I don't I don't remember ever having something like that let me just check the, the internal the internal wiki yeah yeah turtle wiki shotgun I don't think we ever had a shotgun no it's on the wiki that never happened I mean yeah that's actually true we have we had the mark ii rifle yeah the mark ii rifle that was worse than the mark one rifle yeah see that's on there that's under old unreleased content not true was released thank you very much yeah was promptly unreleased though yeah define release like people played it it was in the game and people were like why is this why it's it's, okay so it held six rounds instead of 10 and dealt 12 damage per hit instead of six the rifle so like yeah I was weird it's like less rounds more damage I guess though if you don't know what we're talking about by the way it's the you you have like the the gun the rifle in the game and we had like ideas like maybe we should have a mark ii rifle at some point and we decided not to do it but at that time we had balanced the rifle in a certain way and the mark ii rifle was balanced like a little bit better than the first iteration but then we opted just like let's just improve the first rifle and just have one rifle and then at some point we accidentally included the mark ii rifle but that was balanced for the first version of that which we never released hence it was worse than the first rifle but it was mark two which didn't make any sense and that was not supposed to be in there so whoops
