### Transcript

> when 1.0 I can't say I can't say I can't share that information unfortunately one of the reasons is also because as as folks have known here at coffee stain with satisfactory, our planning has always been pretty volatile, you know we've always had plans and we work towards those plans but we very rarely, stick to those plans so it would be really shitty if I gave you like a release date from 1.0 now when there's like a really really good chance that it's going to be not not be that date so that doesn't really make much sense, the other thing is that the next update is is not 1.0 it's a different update, I can tell you that much and so we also don't really want to like we don't we don't want we don't necessarily I does this make sense we don't really want to like muddy the waters with like what updates look forward to like we just want to be like hey the next one is the fun one all right let's just focus and get excited for the next one and then like we'll look down the line I don't know if that's like weird I think I think it makes sense makes sense to me to do that
