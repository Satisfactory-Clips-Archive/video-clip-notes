### Transcript

> fill it out yeah I you know you're also doing the thing we're looking at like I keep forgetting the cameras over there this is so weird I never look this way at a camera no matter where I stream I'm never looking in this direction no right this is like it's super strange yeah, so so real quick also by the way we're in a sort of new area at the office yeah we're still renovating the office and I think we're we're like 70 done with renovations or something looking really good yeah there's a lot of new stuff like there's a whole if you guys remember the patch note video we did we're update four, when we ran around in the office like we were mostly exactly that's the word no yeah yeah it is yeah, we were running around mostly in the like lower area, and that was like probably the area that was like most done when we moved in yeah and now that is like the area that's getting completely like it's probably the least done now yeah right now yeah, so right now it's it's it's looking a bit different here yeah, looking forward to making that, mpv cribs yeah yeah we'll have to do another office store for sure yeah because our old office tour video is like one of our iconic favorite videos that we've ever done yeah so, we definitely want to make another one of those, and this office is pretty gnarly so yeah and we're definitely not gonna do we're definitely gonna do the same like process that we shot that video we're not gonna like script it or anything like that or yeah yeah we kind of just made it up as we went yeah and I think that was I think that's where a lot of the charm came from that video so I think we I think we go with the same approach yeah but we get you in it as well this time I mean you were kind of in it yeah but that was sort of before you were like officially cm yeah so so so right now the area we're in right now is like our this is like the replacement of the cinema kind of kind of, because there's a big ass tv over there that you guys can't see yeah, the biggest tv I've ever seen there's another tv over there actually that you guys can't see, there's like a whole couch group behind us as well that I've covered up with a big thing the space elevator, so yeah there's, there's a bunch of cool stuff we also have a karaoke room now yeah we actually have a character oh we have to do a karaoke video or something at some point that's it like the the office they're like at the end of just drunk and be like oh yeah yeah I think we'll have to do something like that I think yeah, so yeah maybe the set looks a bit different that's because it is, we might even in the future build a proper streaming set yeah, we'll see we'll see what happens now who knows what the future will hold but that's that's why things look a bit different here today because this was easier to set up in here yes et cetera et cetera all right
