> and yeah so serious question how will we cross play I don't actually know the inside's announced yet, yeah I don't I don't know do you know, I mean we I know what we're shooting for but we're still kind of like figuring out what works and what doesn't, it's both like in terms of what is supported in in each api because epic has really good support when it comes to like interlocking with steam, so but it all comes down to like okay it's also aspect as to like okay but what's the easiest way for someone who wants to play with steam friends like is it easier to connect with steam on my end or is it easier if they log in like with an epic account or like all these different questions that comes up with like ux and and that is one aspect and as I mentioned before that technical actually like implementing the api is another thing and all these like different steam features that exist, with like cloud saves and blah blah blah blah for on on steam send because we have to like strip the different versions and it's also internally a big thing for us to be able to like because we have a build machine that automatic like we essentially push push a switch and it builds a certain version of the game for us and and it pushes it to like the server that can distribute it via epic and blah blah blah and we also need to do a bunch of work so that we can be like okay build the steam version build the epic version and that's supposed to be like okay I'm gonna strip out all the epic stuff from the epic version I'm gonna strip out the steam stuff from the epic verse did I say the wrong way whatever so you get the right version as well when you're building in that configuration and whatnot so that's also a big big part of why it's taking long like why it's taking time is actually because that needs to be in place for us before we can actually start rolling out anything, so yeah lengthy answer to I guess, fairly easy but it's informative yeah
