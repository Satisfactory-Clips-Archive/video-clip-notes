### Transcript

> ain't that bad yeah, would the packet machine cost the same amount of power as a refinery to do the same or it's going to be actually good, we talked about this last week, like if you want to check the spec we gave the specifics i don't know if someone had made like a write-up or something or read it but last week we talked all that we gave all the juicy details about the packager and you can check out the vaude i'll give a quick tldr and that is that no it will not use the same amount of power if i remember correctly the refineries use 30 megawatts and the packager will use 10 megawatts, and yes it will be cheaper to use it will take up less space you can fit one packager on like one foundation block and it's like less than three walls or it's like roughly three walls high so it's way smaller and it uses less power than refineries do so to answer the question will it actually be good i don't know i think it's pretty good i've tested it all right you guys
