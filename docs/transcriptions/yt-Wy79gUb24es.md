### Transcript

> a lot of people have been asking us like do you think we'll be using unreal engine 5 for satisfactory um i know what my answer is but i want to ask you the same question do you think we'll use unreal engine 5 for satisfactory they claim that it will be kind of easy to port forward it's like ported forward to the engine so i i don't know it's very hard to tell i kind of assumes that we will maybe upgrade sometime but using the engine and using this technology is not the same thing i think so we might use the engine inside at some point but i don't think we will actually move to nanites but that's just me i i can't know but i don't think we'll use nanites that's just yeah yeah that's that's probably my take as well i think because yeah they claim that it's going to be the same thing as something in the minor versions and to be honest like updating the engine version is uh like we've done a bunch of like edits to the engine itself our our edits are like not huge so but it is it is a hassle to update the engine every time we do um it's like i don't know is it like a week's worth of like dedicated work for two people or something like that or yeah i think it's something like that and then there's also it it depends on how big the upgrade was and then also the testing that goes in that we were introduced because how they changed something under the surface and because we are assuming how the engine works when we write the game if they change that it might be hard for us to detect it's like yes the order of an operation is changed or something on the surface and it can create bugs that we don't it takes time for us to find but yeah it's it's kind it it's various i would say um but yeah i'm kind of the same i agree with you there like we probably will probably be using unreal 95 for satisfaction in the future we probably won't use nanite or probably not used lumen either just because like there's so much work we've put into optimizing the game to be where it is today and i don't think like just swapping over to that new rendering technique like we won't see a gain i think well i think we'll need to redo a lot of stuff in terms of optimization i would love to see lumen though yeah because like right now we have personal pet peeve like everyone have have those like i i want to fix this or something like for me inside factory sometimes not now the lighting it doesn't feel like inside in enough for me so it's like if we do actual global illumination that would fix that i think but it's like i have no idea of the overhead in doing using lumen yeah so maybe it's impossible to just fit it in uh and there is this like it's just me as well i can't speak for others and yeah it's a hardshell and i just hope
