> added in this update is going to be the trains of course aka the electric locomotive so of course it runs on electricity which means you don't have to add fuel to it it's really fast it's really fun to drive around it has a high capacity you can keep adding freight cars to it as much as you want so it's it's super super useful in in that sense there is one downside however is that it is expensive you have to create all of the train track pieces yourself and they're expensive but in the long run it's usually worth it trains need to stop somewhere of course so we've also added train station the cool thing about train stations is they can be powered with electricity they then send electricity down the train tracks which power the trains but they also power other train stations and then if you have you know another train station at an outpost you can then use the power from the train station to power the outpost so you don't need like another cold generator or anything like that so it's really cool you can think of the train tracks kind of like power cables the other thing is you could also name the train stations of course to make things easier when you program the automation for your trains so for your train to transport cargo you need freight cars and so you can add as many as you want to a train and then to load and unload those freight cars you need freight ducting stations that are attached to your train stations and so if you have ten freight cars you can have ten docking stations and they will all load and unload when your train stops at a train station but perhaps you don't once you load and unload all of your freight cars at every train station and so what we have these empty platforms that you can put between docking stations so for example if you have ten freight cars at one station you may have five docking stations which load and unload the first five freight cars but at the next station you put five empty platforms and then five docking stations so that at that station it load and unloads the last five freight cars so you have a lot of control on how you want to do this and you can get pretty creative with it so we've also added switches to the game and what they do is they split the train tracks so that different trains can take different routes and so after you program your trains they automatically
