### Transcript

> considering using smartbot for the first time let's break anything with the save after update five, we don't really make any guarantees with mods my dog because we don't officially support them so i can't really tell you i mean first of all if you're using a mod it's gonna break after update 5. that's just what's going to happen usually the mods the modders need to, fix up the mods after every sort of major update to make sure that they keep working so i mean yeah it's probably going to break if you use mods but then the models will probably fix it especially when it comes to smart mod i know that's that's one that's usually that's you know highly requested and highly demanded sort of thing by people so i'm pretty sure that the dev will probably, get it working again as quickly as possible but that's just my assumption
