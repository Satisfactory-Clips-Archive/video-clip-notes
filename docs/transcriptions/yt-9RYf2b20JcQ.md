### Transcript

> all right don't worry about it so in two weeks, the, the why why am i like on a live streaming thing and i have to talk and i can't even do that in two weeks we're gonna release the, update for on early access we're still in experimental with it we're working on fixing the bugs with it you know fine-tuning it, doing a little bit of balancing i don't know if you guys saw the video i put out last week, so i'm gonna do a little bit of a tldr from that video if you already seen it then this will probably be old news but, yeah so last week i released a video you can check it out if you go to our youtube channel, where i gave a summary of kind of what changes are coming in in update for on experimental until it hits ea and old news yeah, and essentially what that is is there are a few balancing changes we're gonna do we're gonna do some changes to box site, we made it we made it cheaper in update four but we feel like we made it a little bit too cheap we're not gonna change any ingredients to the recipes we're just gonna change some of the like like the input output sort of rates, for those recipes, to find like fine-tune them to be more what we want the balance to be and there's gonna be a few tweaks to like some of the other main recipes possibly we're not 100 sure of that yet i know that people probably want to know like what exactly is gonna change but we haven't decided yet, we're kind of like playing it by ear a little bit, and seeing what you guys are saying, and and go with that but some of the alternative recipes, we feel like are a little bit out of whack currently in update four some of them are too easy or too cheap and some of them just like don't make any sense right now some of them are like just borderline like not usable so we're going to be changing some of those and same thing there i don't know exactly which alternative recipes are going to change, we just want to give you a heads up kind of like that there are still changes happening on update 4 in experimental, and if you're one of those people that are like get upset about the fact that we changed we've done this before by the way we did the same thing in update through like experimental so if you played an experimental update 3 and you don't remember this being an issue then probably won't be an issue here either, but if you're one of those people that like don't want to touch like you don't want to start setting up things if you if you need to touch it at all avoid the alternate recipes that are new in update 4 and alternate recipes that are related to box site refinement in update 4. dope
