> well howdy everybody welcome to our weekly devstream, where we stall for time for two hours we sure do try to distract everyone from the fact that there's been no real meaningful updates to the game just yet with comedy and hijinks but, things are a-changing kinda, it's actually this is true so this whole stalling phase is actually coming to an end pretty soon yeah because this week on friday we're gonna release a video on our youtube channel that is gonna have a lot of information about what's gonna happen going forward, a lot of information about a certain certain possibly update that may be coming to the game, it, might be six seven is right out, right out or we could skip six and go straight to seven you never know you're like you know right yeah nine yes sundance helix is you know do you work for us or something what's going on leaked I can't believe it I didn't I can't believe the leak didn't come from us this time yeah but you know what, someone said hey no teasing come on actually I mean the way we've said this is the way we say all the other that we say but actually we're being serious here actually this friday we, we mentioned that we might do that you know last week we mentioned we might do it this week and those plans haven't changed so, the plan is to give a bunch of information regarding update six this friday and when we say a bunch of information we actually mean a bunch of information yeah, there's probably going to be a lot of information, yeah for real actually for real yes yes for real for real fire fancy update, actually we should just skip maybe the video and just make it fun another fan fancy podcast I don't know yes yes so, something to get excited for maybe maybe we we're certainly excited slash nervous I guess it's gonna be a little bit different but, I'm I think change is good and I'm looking forward to seeing like what the reception will be of of the video essentially I hate change personally

> so yeah we're giving you the countdown of the countdown here no this is yeah this is this is the countdown I guess we gave you the countdown to the countdown last week and this is the countdown the actual countdown yes well yeah if you, you know I'm assuming you're all satisfactory fans or final fantasy fans I'm not sure, at this point who knows but if you are satisfactory fan, definitely go to youtube I'm gonna put the, link you can use the command for the link, I'll put in the discord as well definitely go subscribe to our youtube channel, where we will be posting a video yeah I guess 5 p.m cest which might be like 6 p.m gmt or something I'm not sure wait the usual time that we upload videos is it yeah whatever it's one of those times maybe it's 4 p.m I'm not sure- I don't know time zones confuse me so much yeah, yeah actually some exciting news we're gonna have movement finally it's been a while since we've been able to tell you guys anything and so we really want to make up with that for that by well this is not the only reason why we're going to share a lot of information but we also think that this this new approach is going to be good for this update can't wait to disappoint you all after all this time, but yeah I know it's going to be super cool, and speaking of our youtube channel last week we put out a video about the like first year of development unsatisfactory, so if you guys, missed that and you're curious about like the the very early like version of satisfactory from like 2016 2017 like that era, then highly recommend it we got we got our boss to show up and talk yeah actually it's it's, it's it's really really good because they like they literally play the first ever build of satisfactory that wasn't the initial prototype like of this actual project you see like the first ever miner ever ever made you know and then you sort of see the game develop over time it's actually a really really cool video, I wasn't involved in making that video so when I got to see it like after it was kind of edited it was it was a real treat so if you haven't checked it out again our youtube channel, yep that one, that video is our latest one yeah we we even managed to dig up footage from like the the very first like, the prototype for satisfactory where like the game jam game that was made, back yeah in 2016 I assume, yeah that like started development of the game entirely, so super stoked that we found that, I had to do some jinxing with the footage because it was kind of broken when I got it but, we we managed to pull through so there's there's also that in there it was really cool that you got to put it include that a little bit yeah do you guys get paid per view or something no we're just trying to share the the video my dude we we spent a lot of time making that content so that you guys can enjoy it you know we don't add ads to it or anything like that we make no money from it we just want you guys to, enjoy the stuff that we put a lot of a lot of time into making, we should put ads on them so we can make all the big money oh yeah that's it let's let's monetize that those videos dude there's there's some humor in like making that type of content and then like have a huge section of we go like this video sponsor rachel like a completely like ad for a different game and like a completely different audience like I think that would be funny I had to do once you know where I learned about big factories skillshare skillshare is an online community learning community oh my god whenever I said my package is up to the mothership I make sure to do it securely with nordvpn it is freaking ingrained at this point we have we have done like valheim ads I guess, be quiet hello fresh hello friends dude how are they not paying us yeah actually there's a lot of companies we've made ads for we've made ads for subway kind of as well the simon saga thing yeah yeah, were we trying to get sponsored in like every single video we put out, and then hello fresh again you're getting it free from the stream here yeah we should stop because you could you could buy satisfactory with subway gift cards yeah that's true I forgot about that holy that's right that's where that came from oh dude this awakened like a part of my memory that I just like didn't oh my god that's true but we gotta recap this for people that are so confused right now so when epic launched, their store they had like a plethora of like different ways to buy games right and one of them was payment options yeah payment options and one of them was subway gift cards and I guess it was a u.s thing where maybe you can convert them or something but it was just so random to be like yeah you got paypal mastercard subway gift vouchers like what I don't know I really I really want to meet the person that bought satisfactory with the satisfactory gift card and shake their hand there's gonna be someone there's gotta be someone oh so funny can I buy satisfactory with final fantasy currency in gill ah yes oh god 4000 gil let's reach out to square enix and make that make it happen yeah yeah all right anyways we already derailed the the stream with fine fancy, content it's coming through, but yeah, others there is a little bit more state of dev stuff which is merch related so some folks asked me last week any updates on the eu merch status and so I asked I asked the mothership I was like hey mothership how's it going and, they said I'm just a ship leave me alone, but it turns out there's actually some movement when it comes to the eu merch stuff I can't really give any sort of details yet but I can say that there's a good chance that we might be we might have found someone to sign on with, and that this is and so we might actually have something happening I don't know how soon but like this is a huge step like finding someone that we can partner with to make this happen for, merch in the eu is, has been a really really big struggle for the past couple years quite frankly, and the fact that we we may have found someone to do this with is huge, it's not it's not 100 locked in yet but this is actually a pretty big movement regardless so, hopefully, no- I don't I don't really know in what way this will be I don't know what merch will be available in eu or on the other north american stores, whether everything will be exactly the same or not I'm not sure I have no idea what this sort of entails we just have to kind of see how like these, how all this sort of pans out to see if this actually does get locked in, or not because it might not, but if it does then we will just sort of see what what options are are available to our eu folks that's pretty cool yeah and, for our non-north american and non-eu folks I have no idea what's going on, yeah no idea one step at a time I guess yeah yeah this this is so convoluted like making merch and like shipping merch at like so much work- I am surprised every time when I learn more about it like how much work goes into it, so yeah cool lots of updates this week huh huh you guys wow it's like it's almost like you're tuning in for something where we talk about our game or something I don't know it's like we might actually do something yeah but we might actually do stuff a coffee stain I can't believe it been so long an update feels like we never do anything yeah it is it is, it is tricky to like always give updates on everything because takes time to make, so we do get these, windows of of, no big real news but we still want to be there like we didn't want to like stop streaming during these moments because I think it's still important that we sort of acknowledge, what's going on in community and like still talk to you guys show you that you were still here not gone right
