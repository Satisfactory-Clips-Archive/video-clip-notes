> will there be any major changes to the game with update 4. so there will be one major change, and that is that the whole balancing of tier 7 will kind of be thrown in for a loop, and there is a video that jace put out I'm gonna see if I can find that there's been a lot of, videos that jace but I'm just like delegating all my all my answers to jase, but jace made a video, let's see two weeks ago there we go cop and paste that into chat where he, talks about tier 8 and tier 8 is coming I guess that was I guess I forgot to mention that during our state of dev but we have confirmed that tier viii is going to be in update four we have confirmed that tier vii will need a rebalance because of that and jace goes into detail about the rebalancing of tier seven I don't actually know the specifics of it I know that some like the battery line like some nuclear stuff nuclear rods maybe got changed and but the the thing I do know that is that there's two things that you can do right now to kind of mitigate the the rebalancing that's coming so it will quote-unquote break your shapes when you load up the new save in update four it will still like load as regular like we use the term break as in like your factory may not work the way that you maybe intended it to so most of the tier seven lines will be broken, in in update four, and there are two ways you can mitigate for this this is either you don't build anything for tier seven or you stockpile parts for t7 so you can use them in tier eight stuff to save you a little bit of time and yeah that's, that's the gist of that so, long story short about rebalance for tier seven is coming be prepared tier seven is coming
