### Transcript

> if we consider something like the smart mod for foundations we have looked at that, i don't know it's very split at the studio what what direction we're going to go with that some people really like the smart mod some really don't want to go that direction because we feel like it like ruins the fun with the game, it's very split and and i know that like it's it's this is something that might be hard for you guys to see but we see it a lot it's it's very it may seem very like everyone wants it but it's the same thing with like everybody wants tower defense in the game not everybody wants tower defense in the game some people really want it some people really don't want it and i think the problem with the the foundation building is that there are certain things that people really think they want but there are other problems that's causing him to want to have it, it's the same thing with blueprints but we are still considering it and we're still looking at what the best solution is so there's going to be a solution to it i don't know if it's going to be like the smart mod thing we just drag because i don't think we'd like that necessarily but there's going to be a solution to that problem
