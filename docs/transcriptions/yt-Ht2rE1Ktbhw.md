### Transcript

> good yeah so so that was the video right there um i don't know how much uh yeah like we said before we probably won't like explain everything into the video maybe we'll just like sort of you know talk over what you're seeing here maybe so so one thing that i saw people commenting on was that like how train lines look a much like cleaner to the ground i don't think we've changed that that's just that's yeah that's an issue i've been like very carefully when i'm placing this making sure that i'm only placing it in places where it looks good um you're just a great builder so um because it is it is doable to get the train lines to like lay down flat and look good you just have to be kind of meticulous about it
