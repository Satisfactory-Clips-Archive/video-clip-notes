> are there plans to make alternate player models in the awesome shop helmetless models jace-faced models, so I mean no there aren't any plans for that and but my mind immediately thought of like we could have snoot and jace models but if we did it you and I have to model our own faces and that's what we roll with if we do it ourselves we would do it ourselves yeah we would model and texture our own faces and that would be what we go with that would be, top 10 out of 10. or muddle each other that's pretty funny too oh yeah oh it's gonna lose out here it's like or or if you could do the thing where like you you do the modeling but you can't look at it while you're doing you know there's like drawing exercises yeah you can't lift the pen or something like that we should do a stream where we model each other's we can't have funny that's so good and then we put it in yeah how hard can I mean I like this yeah I'd have to just do a couple tutorials on blender or something just to make sure that I could find the role you know how where all the little tools are I'm sure I've done like a little bit of 3d modeling a long time ago yeah I've done a lot of modeling in military actually so- I feel I haven't used the sculpting tool that much but I do a lot of modeling, but like simon is really because simon is the the go-to source here like he can definitely get the the ball rolling when it comes to knowledge from that so put a pin in that that's an interesting I that expression always sounds so negative like put a pin in it but that is literally like gotta remember that that's a good one yep
