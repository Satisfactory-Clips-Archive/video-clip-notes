> I really enjoy when you all share community builds on stream do you have a current favorite build style for billings yeah I also love doing that, I've been very busy these last couple of weeks so the prospect of of collect because like collecting the community highlights takes a long time, and it was time I unfortunately didn't have and hopefully I will have it next week but yeah but yeah this I love I love it when, you know I have a very distinct style that I really prefer and I don't want to color like I love like this this doesn't affect the way well kind of how I pick which which builds show up in the community highlights but, I pick builds that I think are cool and have like something interesting to talk about and are impressive in in their own way you know like sometimes you have a bill that's just like just one, one big foundation it's like a big multi-factor and it's making everything and it's all like laid out very you know that's impressive in one way and then you have other buildings where like not much is going on but it's like a really creatively built building and it's using you know the build mechanics in a way that I didn't think about like that's also super interesting so so there's a there's a lot of different like aspects that tick the box for me when I'm picking community highlights as to like why I want to feature them, because there's there's you know there's not one player type for our game there are several and they they're all impressive in their own way right but for me when it comes to to what I like to see is I like to see when people like involve the the environment in their build so like- I think it's cool when I see people like just build out in the ocean just make like really impressive buildings that they need a lot of space for I also really enjoy seeing people when they build like in like the nooks and crannies of the environment and make use of that, like I love it when I see when people have built like dams and they're utilizing the water and the waterfall and stuff like that or when they you know take the the northern forest for instance and there's like don't chop out chop down any trees and like incorporate them or when they make like you know spots where they've avoided cutting down a tree and just made like a plateau around and stuff like that that that always makes me like super happy

> and when people do something like you can build dams so no you can't build dams but people still make you know the the thing that looks like a dam and I think that's really cool when people do stuff that you know we didn't really anticipate them doing, and then there's also people that just do nutty like too much time was put into this like, like anders strew factory for instance and stuff like that that's that's impressive in its own way, but of course if anything it's always like if you made a crane if you made a ship if you maybe like you're automatically guaranteed to be in the queen highlights not really but I really enjoy builds that,

> that isn't just a cool factory like there's more to it right there there's a lot of different aspects as to what what makes satisfactory interesting to look at and what you know impresses everyone looking at it you know it was fun it only took six weeks oh only six weeks oh, so so that's that's a huge part for me at least yeah treehouse factor is also pretty cool like whenever people do something that I haven't seen before you know that always gets I guess my feathers in a ruffle that's not an expression
