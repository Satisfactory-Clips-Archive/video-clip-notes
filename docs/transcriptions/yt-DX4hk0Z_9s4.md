> other plans to reduce more cause and effect to the game so I, I feel like there should be consequences for abusing this pretty little planet yeah right so, there was like I know in the very beginning of satisfactory there was the intention that, you know like if you build like a lot of stuff it will affect the environment and that might screw with things maybe create like bigger monsters or whatever and then we ended up scrapping that very early I think just to sort of simplify the game I think that the interest for that is probably one where most people are probably like yeah that would be cool but I think it's also something where we I think it's gotten to a point where it's also something that's just not as important as other things like it's one it's it's a cool feature but there's a lot of features that would just be cool but what is the game what do we think the game absolutely needs to get to 1.0 and I'm not sure if we think that environment stuff, matters, for a 1.0 release, yeah that's kind of where I think it lies right now
