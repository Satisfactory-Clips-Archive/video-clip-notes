> i need more water i'll be right back okay hold the fork you bet i'm actually oh this is a pretty good question oh god that's going to burn oh that was weird um when are you guys going to fix the trees of life that respawn all the time that's a really good question because we don't know internally really because the the that bug or whatever is like what are you guys laughing about that bug is like i don't get it short so what are you guys talking about all right anyway so so that bug is like has been in the game since launch and it's it's and it's unfortunately like a huge system that we kind of need to rewrite to build to um to fix it and uh the another problem we have is that that system's rewrite also hinges on like other systems that we're working on currently so we need to finish up those first so hopefully we can look into that somewhat soon um i don't know if it's going to happen for update five it might actually take longer than that which is a bit unfortunate but maybe we'll have time to re-work with that but i don't think so because that's a huge system we need to rewrite we need entire we pretty much need to like rewrite the entire like foliage system that we have in the game right now um so uh that's a bit of a bummer but i think we can we're going to solve it at some point or at least that's the intent i'm going to solve it at some point
