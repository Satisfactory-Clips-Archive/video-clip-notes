> build one key thing with the radar tower 2 is that they now also reveal all the resources within that area within that radius of the radar tower, and this is great because now you can get a better sense of like what is in here like what is here instead of just using the the scanner so yeah I will show you all the resources that are here it'll also show the purity if you hover over them, it will also show you if you've claimed the monastery over here for instance I've played a couple of iron roads, and a couple of quartz nodes apparently so yeah I will show you like these, here in the list and you can also use this list like kind of like if you're looking specifically for copper r you can use this to highlight them on the map if you want to look specifically for unclaimed copper ore you can do that if you want to look for specific claimed iron ore for instance here, you can do this as well they will highlight them, so yeah this this I this like the whole point of this is that you can get a better understanding of what's in the environment and a better sense of like plotting out what you want to do in that environment so you know if you see this
