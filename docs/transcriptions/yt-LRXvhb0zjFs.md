> are you gonna buff the rifle damage ooh what do you think about this mark, probably yeah we want a better progression for weapons in general because currently everything is when it comes to weapons and just exploration is kind of balanced around this idea if we have a very small pool of stuff to play with there so, we didn't go too crazy there because we couldn't really afford a proper progression because generally what you would want is that you get one weapon and the next weapon is stronger and stronger and stronger and that feels nice but then we have a basher a rebar gun and a rifle and we all wanted them to them to still be viable so actually balance the rifle somewhat to the rebar gun and the current progression is more based on players, skill and getting new tools like the jetpack to kind of outplay the ai which is not really what i want for the combat but it's just the way the limitation that we have right now because we haven't really focused on that part of the game in such a long time but i'm hoping to put more more time on it pretty soon we actually started working now quite a bit on some stuff there yo just add cooler particle effects and, make it look oh yeah that always layer yeah you know it works
