### Transcript

> but also we worked on moved on working on update five and we have stated before that we think update five is gonna come out in fall sometime we haven't set an internal deadline yet we've only kind of guestimated because we're still trying to kind of iron out exactly what our what update 5 will be because we initially thought that update 5 was going to be smaller when we made our initial planning of all the updates or the updates that we have at the back of our mind right now and fall 2023. all you guys you guys will always get me, yeah it kind of features cheap a little bit but we initially thought that update 5 was going to be a bit smaller, because we initially wanted to release it before vacation but we kind of realized as we were working that it felt it felt like maybe it's unrealistic for us to to say that we're gonna have the update before vacation and especially seeing yes how like we also need like you know a month or so after we're releasing an experimental to be able to catch all the biggest issues that we're running into and being able to to mitigate those so yeah vacation didn't seem realistic or before vacation didn't seem realistic so we're going to wait until after vacation we haven't decided when after vacation it's going to be fairly close after vacation i think but i'm not quite sure and neither are the other people because we're still trying to figure out exactly how update 5 is going to be so when we decided that to move it around that meant that but now that gives you a little bit more time to fit some more things into update 5 and that kind of shifted a little bit what no i'm talking about summer vacation you guys, kind of what will go in each update and we change our minds and and you know that's i think it's good because it gives us an argument as to why we don't have a roadmap, which is the reason why we don't have roadmap is because or a public one at least is because it's very hard for us to to change our minds when we want to and this is this is the case here so, we kind of like move things around we're figuring out like what makes sense what kind of, dependencies exist between the things that we're working on so some things we cannot release until we fix some systems beforehand so we're kind of working on that stuff as well and seeing as i like maybe we'll finish some systems before we thought we were going to finish them and some things might take longer than we thought so things move around a lot and that's just the nature of development, especially in game development but once we know more about when we think we're going to be able to release update 5 we're obviously going to tell you guys we're going gonna do a similar thing we did with a4 where we're gonna, unveil things as we go we're gonna have an open development so to speak where we bring you guys a little bit in the discussion as to what we're doing and showcase some things that we're working on and and you know let you guys be involved a little bit in the decision making that we do
