> figure things out yeah and and this is such a good thing like like like okay now I'm getting a little sappy here right but the satisfactory community is actually like one of the best communities out there it honestly really is and am I biased as a community manager for satisfactory sure but but it's it's it's also like the truth because so like people out there just want things to be good and want things to go well and and so like- I really appreciate it so we can create this kind of stuff knowing that people are so dedicated and so positive that they're just gonna look into like the details figure things out and just just want us to succeed and having random strangers on the [ __ ] internet who have no need to be this kind to us be this kind to us is significant and serious and and the fact that we can count on you guys to take dumb like frames like this what you're seeing right now and turn it into something significant is meaningful and it makes our job as community managers easier okay if we were community managers on this game and no one gave a [ __ ] [ __ ] about it it would be really hard asking me like like it would be really [ __ ] hard as give me an image you guys make it easy for us to do our best exactly you make it so easy for us to to like pump up stuff and exactly always be hyped for it like it's super cool yeah and sure like there's a game there as well but like all the you just yeah like like- I genuinely don't believe as a game developer no game developers deserve this treatment that you guys give us like like we shouldn't expect it right like it would be it would be silly of us to think oh our community should be this passionate no absolutely like no not at all but you are and that makes it easier for us and it makes it so that we can do better all right so like like this trailer is really fun all right and part of that is because of you if anything it makes us want to do better because like the I don't I can't like explain the reason why I spent so much like effort into or we spent so much effort into making this video so good it's just that if it felt like it was worth it when the reaction and everything like when it hit on stream like that makes it so worth like all the because because this was me also working non-stop for two weeks not doing anything but working as well like look and can we can we get can we get massive shout outs to snow and I'm gonna share this [ __ ] like, stream here again shout outs to snoot follow him on twitch we can't we don't really advertise ourselves on our coffee stains, twitch but we you know this is my personal twitter whatever the [ __ ] I want all right and I'm advertising right now snoot right didn't like look you did 90 you did 99 of the video all right like I just showed up right and did like I mean I did a good job- I'm proud of what I did but you did way more than I did I feel like yeah I feel like the video wouldn't be what it is though without the creative feedback and the, the things you and lina's put on the table though just follow so just just just follow just follow like like I've got okay all right now I'm at 3.2 k followers I got like 300 followers tonight you you guys should be following snoot as well all right so like exclamation mark snoot all right please check him out, yeah okay like like I was just on the camera okay but snoop did like all the work all right yeah so let's go
