> i hold back building because of the limit um it's hard to answer this question because it really depends on like how actually ambitious you are because most people don't see the build limit and the people that see it have like thousands of hours in their save file um and we are improving the build limit all the time or like not the build image because we can't really do anything about that that's an issue with or that's a limit in the engine itself but we are optimizing the game so that you can place as much as you can um so like if i were playing the game i would really i don't know when i say build limit there isn't really a build limit it's more of a memory limit um because you can't measure how many you objects that the game is using anyway like you can have like thousands of uh foundation blocks and that's that's one way to measure it but then like if you add like one machine that that counts as more i don't know i don't want to go too much into this today because every time i talk about the object limit it turns into a novel if you want to learn more about the object limit then check out the wiki because i think that the wiki has pretty good explanation on it because again it's not a game object limit it's a memory object limit
