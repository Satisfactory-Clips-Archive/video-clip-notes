> one easy mode for satisfactory this is so interesting because some people I see this very often or on our like on our steam chat on steam forms and stuff like that there's there's like people either come in and complain about how the game is too hard like the game is impossible I can't I can't finish the game because it's so hard like in terms of combat specifically and stuff like that like there's there's so much going on there's so many creatures I die all the time this game is too hard and then other people show up and say this game is too easy there's not enough like the creatures aren't hard enough you have too much health, the weapons are too op, and I'm just sitting like all right bruh what do I do here okay I don't think we want to make a hard game per se I think you know because satisfactory is about the the factory building the the survival aspects of the game are very minor and there are games that do the survival aspect like way better than satisfactory does so we just want that chill like factory building experience, but if anything we would like more variety you know yeah no okay that's true satisfactory does involve a lot of math which makes it makes it way harder so impossible
