> yeah what does that one mean it's like what's the english version of that it's like don't take out, you just you shouldn't celebrate before you're actually, finished or don't count the chickens before they hatch or something like that I think that's is that an expression yeah is it don't count the eggs before the chickens don't chicken the eggs before you count the bombs what yeah eggs for the hatch that's yeah yeah yeah yeah they count the eggs before they hatch or something exactly yeah very similar very similar yeah so like it literally I think it means like, like don't I don't know why you're shouting hello or hey yeah but you know you need to cross the stream first then celebrate when you're on the other side dude yeah that that's saying there's a bunch of things that I've heard my entire life and I've always been like what does that mean and that one is one of them I was just like yeah I remember hearing my my parents say it and just like what what what do you mean yeah yeah I mean that one always makes me think like don't throw your game in dota oh yeah like oh we're ahead then you get complacent and then you lose yeah that's true that happens a lot of rock league too or like you're up by like five goals you're like easy and then you do like a downward spiral exactly yeah I got another one there's no cow on the ice what I didn't even recognize that one there's no cow on the ice okay you've never heard that before no is that like a is that like a regional thing or whatever yeah yeah yeah so, it means I think it means like don't worry because like if there's a cow on the ice that would be weird but something like it would be weird it would be weird but there's no cow so it's not a big deal just chill yeah that makes sense it's a fact yeah for sure but then then we then we get to the two really famous ones that you probably figure I'm gonna be talking about but, if there's room in the heart there's room for the ass yeah another one I still don't quite understand where it's originated from but it's like, you say it when when like oh sorry the car's full but we can probably squeeze another person in you know like we love you so obviously we want to make room for you it it sounds good in swedish because it kind of rhymes right but yeah it's just really random and weird so in english it's if oh you go say this, or something like that yeah exactly I think it kind of sounds cute swedish it must be like a literal thing always because I can't remember using it in any other circumstance other than like oh no we can squeeze another person in yeah or I think it's like move over and you could say it like before jumping jumping on the couch and you're like you're moving over you can say that yeah yeah so it's if there's room in the heart there's room for the the the ass if you're all friends you can always squeeze in another person basically yep all right we got one more you ready this is gonna be good I have a feeling to [ __ ] in the blue cabinet

> like I've only heard it in like very strange circumstances so I actually don't know when I would use it yeah certainly not a phrase I would use because I actually don't feel like I know when I would use it but it's like I haven't but it's essentially like if you [ __ ] up if you [ __ ] up yeah if you're [ __ ] the blue cabinet you [ __ ] up yeah all right you're supposed to shoot [ __ ] in the red one yeah yeah yeah exactly all right you [ __ ] up, I've actually never heard anyone ever say it but like whenever we talk about funny things in swedish people always bring that one up yeah I feel like, yola, our previous ceo might have said like I feel like I've heard him use that one a couple of times yeah he strikes me someone who might say say it yeah I could imagine him using it yeah but no- I can only write like I can only remember occasions when people have said it and I more as a joke of the expression rather than actually using the expression yeah right it's definitely an expression it's a it's it's an absurd expression yeah brown cabinet yeah it's brown cabinet now david yeah why is the cabinet blue it's that's that's an interesting question too why specifically blue like now you've all got homework research that I want, a paper on our stream, next week all right there's another there's another expression too that's like taste is like the ass or like your butt what taste taste as in like your your your music taste or like you know like your taste in in in what kind of movies you want to watch right yeah yeah so like the expression is taste is like your butt divided is the whole expression but peop most people don't say it that way they just say it tastes like your butt so in swedish it's, smoking some baking which also kind of rhymes right yeah and I and I grew up hearing that all the time like oh it tastes like a butt and I'm like what what do you mean tastes like your butt and it's it's a pun because it's like tastes like your butt it's divided as in like you have two butt cheeks right so it's divided you know and not everyone has the same taste as the it's like the message of the expression but I grew up not hearing the entire expression I just grow up hearing people say like oh your taste is like your butt I was like what does that mean like that makes as much sense to me as if it does for you so like what the [ __ ] it's stinky yeah it's like you know what I think of your taste in music it's like your butt it's like your ass it's kind of like the whole, every opinions like [ __ ] or something everyone has one oh yeah kind of similar yeah yeah so welcome to the satisfactory stream everybody today we've got a riveting, show for you all right just be happy we didn't start with final fantasy okay like that's that's, that's a win for you guys we're we're trying to branch out exactly exactly you gotta diversify your portfolio
