> so yeah I can see I can see a lot of familiar names here got josh andrew thank you so much everyone for by the way like there are so many names here in chat that I see every week almost, I'm so happy that people want to show up on our streams, it's it's a lot of fun doing these streams they're a bit hectic to like prepare for, but I've really enjoyed I will call us out yeah yeah, no but it's it's it's amazing to to see that people actually tune in for these, and it's it's it's like one of the tools that we have really to be able to be reactive to what's going on in our community, we think it's really important that we are reactive and you know that we are like out there or whatever you want to call it right like we're on the discord and like the reddit all the time maybe even if we're not writing I'm we're on there every single day you know reading what you guys are writing, and it can be pretty hectic sometimes if we jump in so so maybe we don't do it all the time but the streams are like perfect format for us to be able to like talk to people and and and stuff like that where's chase jace is on vacation still, we are closing in on that I mean it is that time of the year right where, vacation is upon us, coffee saying we're probably gonna take a little bit of a longer holiday break because we've been, working really hard on update five and like on the dedicated servers but also fixmas had to happen we've it was a really kind of I wouldn't say like rushed end of the year but it's been very hectic, if anything so, it's amazing that we managed to get you know everything out by the end of the year we were kind of like hesitant that we would be able to, and and that's not just like speaking of fixmas that's also talking about update five like update five was, like a lot of work update five was gonna be a smaller update and then it turned into a much bigger one and it just ended up feeling like we went back and forth so much we got day five, where we were like let's make a small one and then let's not make a small one and like let's move things around and then we felt like we're not adding two enough in update five and then it ended up being like a huge huge like success for us, so yeah everything's very hectic is what I'm trying to say, but before we even update five we also have update four, which honestly when I think about update four it feels like it was a like a different time
>
> [Music]
>
> like it feels like it was in 2021 if it's like was 2019 or something you know, but update four also came out this year and it was also very special because like the majority of depth before if not all of update 4 actually was produced from home because of kovid so that was very different for us, and I think one really like nice thing about update four was that I don't think development really slowed down too much on update four we still kept like the schedule because we roughly released two updates a year, I or maybe we have always released two updates two major ones at least, and we've kind of like kept that schedule going even though we don't really intend to keep that schedule going because we you know we
>
> [Music]

> we are always try to, keep the the idea that we won't release anything unless we're happy with it and we shouldn't focus too much on you know like we gotta release two updates every year because maybe we won't next year you never know it always comes down to what works you know at the time and hopefully you guys are aware of this hopefully we're clear whenever you know the way that we do things hopefully it's clear though that you know we do this for for a reason, we really always take like all the choices we make for our game is always about what is best for the game what works best for us but also like meet you guys halfway, so it's not just what fit sets it's also kind of what you guys want, and it's really important for us to have this kind of like release schedule or whatever not really scheduled but like working the way that we do is really important for us because otherwise we don't think we would make as good as a game that we are working on, or we wouldn't at least we wouldn't be as happy as working on the game that we are so, I think that's that's the most important thing, so it's gonna be shame that I've been more busy with end walker honestly that's a good thing if anything so, yeah so I don't really have any updates on what's gonna happen next year I think harvesting has always been sort of like we'll do things one at a time we have started working on new things, and, you know as as always we are very determined to reach 1.0 at one point we will not be in early access forever that is super important to us, for for a couple of reasons one is because you guys have paid for an early access game or guy people are waiting for the actual release of the game, so we want to do right there and you know it's it's not a good, or maybe it is in some certain cases depending on how you communicate it but like we don't want to get stuck in the early access phase for for forever you know there are games that have been in the early access stage forever and you know being early access is great, for for us because it really means that we can make the game we want to make like I think that's something that a lot of people forget about when they see games in early access is that it just seems that it's just like a cop-out or whatever, or that you couldn't because that's really what early access is like you can't reach 1.0, to end like the sales or whatever or make the sales amount to you know your prognosis or whatever I'm rambling but, it's also a great tool for us because we that means that we can also you know scale up the vision of the game you know if we were to make 1.0 and release it as it is before we launched early access satisfactory would look very different I guarantee you wouldn't have pipes we probably wouldn't have you know the detail of customization that we have and the build systems that we have
>
> [Music]
>
> because it it's such a good like way to sort of nail down like what we want to make with the game and really like add on top of it, and it's been great doing that honestly I know that a lot of people are like why don't you just fix the bugs and release the game but like there's also a lot of potential to make an even better game you know so if you have never played satisfactory like that experience is gonna be even bigger so I think that's like really where early access games shine, I'll be you have the negatives where you know we aren't able to fix every single bug after every single update you know things are left kind of unfinished for a while and it might seem that we are forgetting things, but that is definitely not the case there's, there's a lot of room for like to fix that once we reach 1.0 so maybe we won't be able to fix like every single thing that people want from 1.0 you know like there are there's that's always the case for games like there's always bugs that you know aren't major issues that maybe some people are more annoyed by than others, and we really have to like make those choices, you know when you release because you're never going to be able to fix everything, but we we want to fix as much as we can major issues, so yeah we're trying to say it's going to slack after 1.0 exactly no but the whole point of this whole ramble was that, if you haven't been on the streams before you haven't heard this before is is really that when we're making updates for the game we have sort of two big motives, and one of them is making a really good update that is like good both quality wise but also that it's like adding something to the game that actually you know satisfies the player base whether you're into you know the base building type or into the factory efficiency type or if you're into the exploring type you know this we have many different player types in our community and it's always hard to please everyone you know for instance we will never be able to add base defense or anything like that for people that want more of that stuff so unfortunately that's not satisfactory, but we do have you know like ideas of what we want the game to be like and our vision for that has pretty much never changed I'd say, we've just added on top of what we already wanted to do because it's kind of frustrating when you set up to make like one game during the early access and then once you release it it's like a completely different game and we don't really we try not to steer too much in that direction but it's always hard but, but we really whenever we're making updates apart from the update we're also really focused on 1.0, and that is a big reason kind of why you may have seen a shift in like how the updates are handled specifically after update three so update four and five we've sort of worked on those updates while also thinking long term for 1.0 and not just thinking you know what are we going to do for this update we're also thinking how do we set up for the major release of the game entirely, so if you guys have seen any difference if you compare them to update three and update two and the other ones like hopefully it's not too obvious that I'm not saying that we're slacking but like we aren't able to you know go full on the updates because we also have to work on the systems for for 1.0 and that's really been update 5 has been a big, part in that setting up the systems you know we were kind of worried that update five wouldn't be you know as grand of a an update as the other ones but we were wrong I'm it's kind of happy that we were wrong about that, so that's really important for us when we're releasing updates and I wouldn't be surprised if we were we might even focus more on this going forward really so you know whether we make an update six or whether we just like hunker down and make 1.0 I don't know maybe it's not impossible, but jase already confirmed that update is coming out on april what was it 12 and 14 what is wait let me check the wiki actually because it's not funny jase has always confirmed update 6 right 32nd 16th, those aren't the only dates right I've never seen this page until now ah okay I have to share this actually I can't just let let this slide, how do I oh no no no no this is kind of great actually so, if you're wondering about update six let me let me share what's going oh wait sorry wrong damn it I always think I'm prepared for every stream and then there's always like one thing I forget to set up here we go so if you're wondering about what update six the wiki got you covered all right so, released at update six it's january 5th no it's march 8th no it's march 9th no wait it's april 22nd year unknown here we don't know, it's also on april 5th tuesday, also april 7th and 9th also 12th could be 13th might as would be 19 30 22. 5 45. this is an oddly specific one it's just like also here's here's a time for the release of the update this one is gonna be tricky, because we're all on break but I'm sure we'll figure something out, we got april 26 tuesday april 26th, april 31st april 32nd and november 31st this skipped significantly we also got enough we also got a release date for update seven apparently, november 15th huh cool update eight holy december 27th 2010 holy that's that's, we got our work cut out for us here holy  update is coming after update seven yeah apparently that seems, yeah it's on the wiki by the way so it must be official because that is that is our official wiki, we've, we've established this many times that we trust anyone working on the wiki pages, we stand by them so this is official so, yeah wikis are always correct especially the official ones okay just just, just so you guys know okay amazing, so yeah that's that's, that's what we're gonna do next year wiki got you covered, yeah someone is actually gonna believe you I'm so sorry december with a z that's like a

> weird like rock band or something easy I don't know, you also get a clip for every single date is now 100 correct as the wiki is official damn right damn right metallica oh that's a good one actually, so yeah we were talking about the 2021 what an amazing year what are you guys favorite part of 2021 doesn't have to be satisfactory could be anything else I don't remember much from this year honestly like I remember we revealed update 4 and it would be 11 day file like that was it we had, golf was pretty fun the whole golf mean I think kicked off this year no was it last year was it this year I can't remember it feels like it was this year I think it was like during my vacation or jace's vacation during summer and then I initiated it and then jace came back and just like spun it even further so golf is a bummer huh staying at home pretty sweet yeah ramp rails that I think that's my one of my favorite, videos that I made was the ram braille one because it came from a place of us not knowing what to do because we had a plan to reveal something else that week and then was delayed the whole update was actually delayed forbid internally and we were like what do we do now and and we're like let's just make a video about ramp rails because that's something we know is finished so and, I love it when people are just like alright snoot just do whatever you want and I'm just like oh boy here we go, because, I like making stupid videos I think, the videos I've made at coffee stain are like 10 of my stupidity, jace always holds me back and just like let's all right one of my also favorite videos that I've ever made was the, when we were in alpha, we we were like every week we'd release like a couple of keys to, to people and we would make like a short video and it just turned into like a stupid thing we just did and one video we had, the first video I made, was was it called it's the one where jace talks to mark this is a simon saga by the way who who's here during simon saga who remembers simon saga that was those were the days we made like how many videos do we make we made 14 videos, question is it I can't remember which one
>
> [Music]
>
> does the one we're trying to get man this brings back memories there was one point where I'm gonna bring this on stream actually so you guys know what the hell I'm talking about actually if you haven't seen the simon saga stuff like there was, it was at one point we try to get sponsorship from subway, so like we would constantly like mention subway in our videos and stuff, never got that sponsorship kind of bummed about that, also had long hair hair here this is this is when is this from how old is this this is from 2018. those are the days huh gosh, simon shows up and eats mcdonald's oh classic simon, the one I'm thinking of is which one is it sorry this is completely off topic this is the one we're marx talks to j's ah good times hair before wigs hell yeah yeah this video was like it's just weird good times what is this video like I don't even remember what this video is about anyway, so yeah good memories old office by the way that office we don't live there anymore we live somewhere else now, what a weird retrospective this was I was supposed to talk about 2021 and I jumped all the way back to 2018 instead, so yeah let's get that subway sponsorship though anyway what else we do, we also released the dedicated service this year after a long time of, saying we're gonna release so originally we wanted to release dedicated servers yeah it's a rewind this is going to be the most disliked stream on our channel because it's a coffee stain rewind, we want to release dedicated servers for update 3 originally and it didn't happen for many reasons and, super cool that we managed to get it out this year because like I think, one issue with dedicated servers was also also that like we never felt that it was finished, like we we didn't want to put that dedicated service until it was a good state and stuff because there were a bunch of like multiplayer bugs that like if you were playing them on multiple on dedicated servers like they wouldn't it wouldn't fly, good thing we can't dislike individual streams on twitch well that's true we're only gonna post our our rewind on twitch that's what we're gonna do it, now the dedicated took some so long to make, for various reasons, because of all the multiplayer bugs there's still a bunch of multiplayer game bugs in the game but now at least you can play on them you know like there was a time where god the dedicated servers were so buggy when we worked on them you can dislike clips on the archive oh   got us there huh, this light counts aren't visible anymore yeah I was kind of like I was so surprised our first video we put out without the dislike bar was the fixmas one, with the the fixmastery and the doggo and all that stuff and I was like there was like 20 minutes of being like hell yeah there's not a single dislike on this video oh eat it and then I was like wait ah this can't be right so that's a bummer, but yeah dedicated service good times good time and I think two other two other highly mentionable things here okay for 21 for coffee stain was that in when we released update 4 we broke our concurrent player account on on all our platforms which is very like how do I how do I put this like as a game developer if you if you, so here here's how it works like usually when you release a game usually you know during your release that's when you're going to see the biggest splash of your game really same thing if you're releasing an early access game like sometimes game developers don't even see like a bigger splash during their 1.0 release like the the first release of your game is always going to be the biggest one typically and then it just like goes straight down right so it is really like humbling that we managed to break our old ccu our concurrent player account from our original release in 2019, you know that is that is something that as a game developer you cannot take for granted that is super like I don't I don't even know how to like put it it is it is super cool to see and it is super like humbling that we've been on this you know steam front page the top 100 games and stuff like that multiple times like some games barely don't even get the first time you know like it is super like I said it's super humbling and the fact that we did it in at the start of 2021 off for update 4 was super amazing but then we broke it again in november which is even more like mind-blowing that people did want to play the game so much so like it is it is insane and it's not something that we definitely don't take for granted, it is it is very humbling to see that same thing with the seeing your game on the steam 100 like to think that out of all the games that are released like we're in that top 100 is it's insane so thank you so much everyone who played our game during those two windows on during the I think it was the first weekend when we launched early access for update four and I think it's the same thing there for update five first weekend, after launch of update five if you played the game during that time thank you so much it it meant the world to us 25 games sold on epic and epstein yeah sales not the same deal but concurrent player base okay that's a different thing right, but thank you so much everyone who played the game, and and thank you everyone who are playing the game and thank you everyone who's you know part of our community really thank you everyone who's here thank you to all our content creators our moderators you know like anyone making mods I'm forgetting people now I shouldn't be hyping people up but like thank you so much for anyone who's been part of this journey, and, yeah it's gonna it's gonna be great to, to see what's gonna happen in 2022 for sure not just like from our perspective because like it's gonna be amazing to see what we're gonna make but also to see what you guys are gonna do, with it so, yeah good times the journey's not over exactly the journey's I wouldn't say it's just begun I mean we we yeah but the the journey is not over, so we are getting there so yeah that's I think that's the retrospective, sort of I kind of ramble a lot, but hopefully someone found it entertaining it's hard
