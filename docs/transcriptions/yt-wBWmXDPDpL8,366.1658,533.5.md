> snit either another good question, students ask here is how do I make modular heavy modular frames in satisfactory you know what I'm curious if we say hey HMF am I asking too much here okay

> in the game satisfactory HMF or as we know high membria thinsulation is a tier two insulation that is used to make equipment that can withstand high temperatures such as the blast furnace to make a HMF you will need the following resources one fiberglass one rubber to obtain these resources you will need to gather them from the environment so like from the fiberglass trees or the rubber rocks or something like that once you have the necessary resources you can cross HMF using a fabricator new building you will need to place the fabricator connected to power and load it with the required resources then you can select the HMF recipe and craft it you can also craft an assembly line of machines to automate the process of obtaining the resources and crafting the HMF this can include using a Constructor pretty good to automatically gather resources usually a minor a smelter to convert the raw materials into ingots true and a manufacture to turn ingots into finished products also true I think I want to ask it again I'll tell it I'll tell it HMF in satisfactory stands for heavy modular frames foreign is a project product that is used to build larger more complex structures true such as the modular frame and the modular platform coming in update 8. to make the heavy modular frames you will need the following resources six iron plates and two screws there's no shot that's true I don't know the heavy modular frame- I block that out of my brain from trauma all right yeah yeah you make them using legal frames that makes sense please don't include this part of the video Mason to obtain these resources you will need to gather iron ore from the environment and then process it using an iron smelter to get iron plates screws are made by by using an assembly machine coming soon and putting iron plates and screws in it then you can craft heavy modular frames using a Constructor okay a Constructor you all want to make heavy modular frames in the Constructor that'd be sick let's ask another question
