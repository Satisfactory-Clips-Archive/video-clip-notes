> in-game event in the near time we have nothing planned right now, but even if we did I think that's one of those things that we wouldn't probably not tell anyone it would be just like here it is have fun because that's how kind of we did with the fixmas event we didn't that was that was also like bonus time, that was that was a lot of that was a lot of labor from from the creative time that I mentioned before where a lot of people got together and started doing like a little bit of creative time and then, people deciding things management or whatever we're like yeah well let's do that and then like here's let's spend a month working on fix it stuff and then we'll make an update with that so but it all started from like people coming up with ideas, there was a very old build I remember I think the very first build of satisfactory ever played had a christmas tree in it oh was it the, princeton family one yes yes and, yep that was a christmas event we had for back in the day it was good yeah that was a secret event nobody even knew about it because the game wasn't even it wasn't even revealed I think at that point, but halloween would be cool I don't know if it's gonna be possible though, just because it's gonna clash with like update five but it would be cool maybe maybe next year we'll see
