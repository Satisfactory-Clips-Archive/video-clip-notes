> and and that's, that's kind of kind of kind of interesting because like the way that we add stuff is like and it's probably obvious by now we don't go to like to our our qa site and take the top things and work down right sometimes we add things that are not super highly requested but they're still good suggestions you know they don't you don't have to have all the votes in order for us to add something but a lot of times the things that we add we we we pick a bunch of things that are kind of relevant to each other right so like we could have added a new wall in each update if we wanted or we could have sat down and come up with a bunch of new buildables that you know people have been asking for and and then while we're building these rework the way that we, the materials that we use rework the the system around it you know so so we we sort of hyper focus on like certain big segments of the game so there might be other things that people want and that people are, requesting but like we'll be like with this update we're focusing here and so buildables is clearly one thing that we've been, focusing on so that's just like a little insight to how we sort of handle these big sort of updates, and and to top them to add on that is also sometimes you also like have like systems that we all internally want to fix and like don't really add anything to you guys but they're like for us it makes it easier to work on like the next system and sometimes you can't work on one system without fixing another one yeah that's another factor that goes into us deciding what we want to do yeah so and there's also the element of like what we want for the game so like of course people are saying what they want but as developers we also have a vision ourselves and we have to make sure that we, take take into consideration what we think the game should be too and I think we do that I think that's good in my in my experience working on other games, or things elsewhere like just like listening to what everyone else says and not following your like your heart or following your vision, usually ends up with worse things yeah like it doesn't make a worse outcome for us then it doesn't feel good doing it it's probably not going to feel super good for a lot of you even if you might think you want it yeah and I think that's a good example of that like is the souping mechanic because that's something that we haven't internally been like super comfortable like about in the way that people have been requesting it now that we sort of like taking a step back and like look at it and reevaluate ourselves we've sort of I think found the middle ground yeah and and and that's and that's sort of the power of the community as well right because like people have been requesting that a lot for a very long time and so I think it's I think it's great that we didn't we didn't just go oh a lot of people want it so we have to make it but instead what we did was we saw a lot of people wanted it so we reconsidered and then we decided you know not to do it, and then we told you that we didn't want to do it but you guys kept telling us that you wanted something a lot something like that so we revisited it again and that process happened a bunch of times you know we've gone back to it many many many times and then now we're at a point where we feel it makes sense yeah and like I know like a lot of people probably would have just wanted us to do this or give you everything from the get-go but like ultimately I think this is a more healthy process which ends up you know don't just look at this one particular feature but if you look at the bigger picture I think we will end up with a better game if we if we maintain this kind of process even though things might take a little longer than what people might want, I think yeah we'll end up making better decisions in the long run yes and I guess on that topic as I say two things that immediately pop up because, the tower defense thing and blueprints right the tower defense thing is is something that we've never felt like the zooping thing is something that we've like internally at least have like discussed and felt like this is something that we could add and it's something we could do something with just don't know exactly what we're gonna do with it tower defense is something that we've like clearly established from the get-go that that's not something that we want to add to the game because we want the game to be a chill factory building game we don't want you to have to like go back and like fix your factory buildings and stuff like that so that's even though this there's a very vocal part of the community that really wants our defense that's not something that really is on the table, and in contrast to blueprints like that's something that we've sort of said for a long time that like that's not something that we want to do but we've sort of also like a little bit going back and forth internally about that we haven't really decided anything yet, I don't even know where our current stance is do you know chase no I don't yeah, but but there are different like there are different, cases where where you know we do these sort of when we evaluate, what we think makes sense in the game and what community really wants and whether or not we should do that or not, so yeah
