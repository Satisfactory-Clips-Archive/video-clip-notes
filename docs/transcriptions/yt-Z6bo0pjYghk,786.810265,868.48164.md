> right so welcome everybody to our, little release stream a little tiny release stream, good times will be had by all it's gonna be a very like chillax stream like maybe you guys remember are akin to the usual way of doing things, like I said at the start of update six it's going to be a little bit different it's gonna be pretty chillax we're gonna have like a couple of people from coffee stain join in and, we're gonna play the game and maybe show a few things that we haven't shown yet which isn't going to be that many things because we've pretty much shown everything but there's been like some development of certain things that I'm looking forward to showing off and, yeah talk about like certain things in certain aspects of the of update 6 that we haven't really like dell into because you know when you're making a video you only have so much time, I'm going to bring back up the little countdown hopefully it works yay look at that so yes we're going to release the update one hour earlier than we usually do and it's going to be at 5 pm cest because we're in summer time now summer standard time no whatever, and the reason for that is because if something breaks which you never know we'll have a little bit more time on our hands, so hopefully you are already stoked so like agenda-wise the only real thing that I have on the agenda is is playing the game together with a bunch of people
