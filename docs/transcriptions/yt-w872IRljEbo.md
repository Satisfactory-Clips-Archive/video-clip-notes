> yes and, yeah dedicated servers are also out we're also working on dedicated server stuff, one thing that i would like to kind of clarify when it comes to the dedicated server is that dedicated servers are kind of like you know running in a parallel track, with the game right like we are working on making sure that the gettysers work fine and that there are no like major issues though right but you know we're not gonna be able to like have dedicated servers reach like a release state when we're done with like the patching for update 5 for early access right the experimental version of dedicated servers will probably keep running, in parallel with the update once it comes out because we have to sort of focus on the game first and foremost because like not everybody's playing on a dedicated server, so when it comes to like features and when it comes to you know general good to haves for the dedicated servers, you know those are going to be running in parallel and those won't like be done for update 5 once it reaches early access right just so you guys know obviously we're going to like fix any major issues that exist like if there are things you can't do on the servers or like related to the game and stuff like that, but you know when it comes to like feature sets that are people are requesting right now, you know they are gonna take time and they're gonna roll out as they're finished essentially
