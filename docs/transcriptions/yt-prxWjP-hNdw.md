> ever been a thought of a general grid overlay that players could enable toggle building on foundations rather than just eyeballing it, I assume you mean like a world grid world grid, we have thought about that we just haven't been able to like do it in a good way it also doesn't I don't know if it really makes too much sense though because like the the world that you're in is kind of like a natural one right so it's like wherever you put your first foundation and however that's lined up that's what's relevant but I guess it's like if you want to build something that like on the other side of the map that's also in the same grid system lines up yeah you could just zoop a massive foundation to it I guess and I mean that's a lot easier now yeah for sure, but we but I think this question specifically was like a visual grid right and we have actually tested that and I don't think we liked it because it just cluttered the view too much but a world great I would love a world grid like in the sense that like you could like you just mentioned if you build something in one corner and like maybe over a pond or something you want to line it up like you would right now you would need to build like a through a foundation clip from your first foundation over to the other side and then remove it so it's like a necessary step but I don't know what we have planned there if we're actually going to like solve that or but it but we are aware of that thing like that concept so we'll see if we can do something about that or not
