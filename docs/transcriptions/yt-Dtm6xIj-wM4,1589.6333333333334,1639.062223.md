### Transcript

> why nerd turrets like sanctum why do you need tarts in this game when they're sanctum yeah, our director yeah the director of the game kind of answered this and basically it was just as we were developing the game and designing it we just felt we didn't need it no like it just wasn't necessary and and you know we had it in the beginning and even though we had it we still were like we don't need this and we got rid of it so I know that that might sound counterintuitive to some but there is like the concept of less is more sometimes and cutting things out can often be the best thing and I think that's what at least the director believes- I'm an idiot so I'm just down with that whatever if you really really hurts Therese your mots turrets menthe
