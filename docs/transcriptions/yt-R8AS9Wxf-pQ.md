> I have a problem with, Shadows of settings when I have it on meeting high or Ultra I get flickering and no flickering when it's on low but it looks so different when it's off how can I fix it so a common fix for flickering is usually verifying save files, save files game files on steamer epic so it's a thing you can right click on the game and do it or whatever, Google it I guess if you're not sure how to do it, and that fixes a lot of the texture flickering things, apart from that making sure your graphics drivers are up to date that's another thing, and then I know that there's like some things internally that we can use that can help with that issue if we experience it but I don't know if they're exposed to you guys I also don't remember what they are I think, we actually pushed that change like to be default in game because there's a setting you can change like the bias or something with the shadow, but there's a there's like there's specific cases where that also doesn't work and that's a bug that we need to fix so that's also something that we need to fix in the future because it's a bug with the, something something within something future stuff hopefully that will fix in the future but you can't remember what the command is but I think that command doesn't really do much anymore after update seven because we defaulted the whatever that change was foreign it's a known issue
