### Transcript

> so the first thing is people have asked about double click blueprint so it's not if you know you haven't been here so, one thing that we sort of talked about was, there's some user ux issues with blueprints, and one solution surrounding building your blueprints is what if it was a thing where you could click to place the the blueprint hologram and you're free to move around and look at it make sure it's like lined up where you want and then you click again to build so basically it's you know when you build like a, conveyor belt poles for example you click once and then you can adjust the height maybe with this thing you can click once maybe you could rotate it who knows right, so that's one thing so people ask is there any updates on that and the message that we got so far is that we are working on improving and expanding building functionality for blueprints, that is gonna happen I've said that before, and the plan was always to finalize blueprints, as part of the future update, because we knew we wouldn't be able to get everything in that we wanted for update seven but you might then say then why did you put it in at all it's because if we didn't put that if we didn't include that we couldn't really include anything else because a lot of things sort of rely on other things a lot of systems do so in order to progress we needed to get it out anyway and then we intended on improving them so that that's always been the playing with blueprints as for the double click placement that's something that we're looking at we've seen it suggested on, on the QA site it's also been suggested internally, independently of the QA site so it's definitely a suggestion that is probably fairly favorable but that doesn't mean we'll do it or not so we don't know if we'll actually go for it or not we're still in the early stages of blueprints, yeah and, that's pretty much that's pretty much it so- I know that my answer to this question I think last week was like oh I don't know and the answer is still I don't know, basically because we we just don't know yet but just so you know people on the team have acknowledged the double clicks as a blueprint option build option, as as we've acknowledged that idea I don't know what we're doing

> because people have been asking that for every building really that like you can sort of place down a ghost building and then okay and, like I can just say real quick for regular buildings because it might be different for blueprints so I'm not saying that we're not going to do for blueprints but one thing that's always been an issue for regular buildings is that it made it kind of awkward to build because in a lot of other games when you do have that functionality usually it's that you like put in resources into the the ghost building and it becomes like a it's like another step of building whereas in our game we felt like it just kind of obstructs the regular building but maybe could be like a separate mode or something like that, but like for the base build game we felt like it was just because I actually worked on that prototype and we felt that it's cool and it's useful sometimes but it's not useful all the time and it's more useful like it's it's only used from certain cases and it's like not worth having that as like part of the regular build system because of that but at that yeah and so maybe even but at that time we didn't have like the different build modes that we had, that we have now like the different snapping modes and stuff like that so you know it's possible that maybe there's there could be a build mode for that in the future, yeah yes we'll see okay so planning mode is something that's been suggested a bunch of times where you just put down a bunch of holograms yeah I don't know sounds like a probably a good idea I think the team has heard that feedback before as well
