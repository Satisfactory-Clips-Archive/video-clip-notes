### Transcript

> uh let's let's continue where were we do you even remember so maybe we just also tell everyone what we're doing here uh we're kind of doing like a director's commentary over the patch notes video because this is very like uh there's a lot of things going on yeah both behind like production-wise but also like what we wanted to do with the video do you want to do a really quick tl dr of this scene because i think it's interesting if you just do it just a quick tldr that this this scene that they're looking at right now on stream like looks simple but it's like really complex so i'm going to transition over to your stream right now isn't it yeah um i could see you now so this this scene is like three different layers of composition so we had a few uh vfx shots with which were made by our vfx artists funny enough uh simon um he made the vfx shots of the lizard doggo and the drones like flying around in the pacino's video and this shot in particular was a little bit of a mess to film because uh the when we needed to film this the lizard dog needed to be like me reacting to the lizard dog i need to be focused all the time because it's easier to like add like things being out of focus than like trying to like add the out of focus on top of the like visual effects so this scene is filmed three times uh there's one time where let's see if i can figure out how to add these layers again yeah so here's here's me reacting here's here's the clean slate of me right and what you're not seeing in this shot is our editor linus like poking the box wait let me let me zoom in on leanness one second yeah yeah yeah

> you can see him on the right there guys you can see him on the right yeah so so i've i've comped out linus out of my play the video a bit so people can see him sort of just move around linus is like the third community manager by the way yeah he's a video editor right but yeah but like the uh teaser trailers and stuff all of him or 99 very involved in the youtube especially yeah so i'm restoring you back to normal now okay um so yeah that's that's one layer and then we have let's see here um wait i think these are just like different takes and that's just the tank that didn't make it in this is funny i'm just i don't know what i'm doing here uh i don't know why i use that shot and then we have let's see here which one is it such a mess what a mess what a mess and then there's your reaction i think it's this later actually no here is so yes and then we have jace's reaction to it all uh which is filmed in front of can i turn off the just just uh just a fun fact here by the way we have a lot more people now watching uh yes i was impersonating dora the explorer okay actually i've never seen dora before but but the the goal was that i would be door the explorer i would in my mind i was thinking blue's clues right but yeah so like i was all like oh my god let's check out what's next oh my god you know like that was kind of like a you know a children's show kind of persona and uh you know where it is oh my god it's a clue you know um that kind of thing and snoot was the normal person was like what are you doing right so that was that was the play here does that make steve blue sure pretty much zapatos had me dying i'm glad you enjoyed that yeah i'm really i'm actually glad that the spanish-speaking folks really enjoyed the spanish lines yeah yeah uh so yeah this this shot in particular was a mess uh and one thing to note if you notice maybe uh let's see if i can get rid of where arizontanto was cool uh you may notice that i'm in focus the entire time which means that the like out of focus portion of the video is actually like fake
