> train should have supports like conveyors and pipes well if we did that then the tracks would always have to be quite close to the ground and that's not really how people like to do things but usually you have to build it on something anyway so folks normally if you're going to be building a train track that's high up they usually build like foundations you put the train track on there and then delete the ones below or don't if you don't want to but again it is it is one of those things where, it's sort of about the I guess kind of like the balance of it you might want your trains it's kind of it's a game where you you can add pillars to it if you want to and you can not if you don't want to right and and that goes the same with conveyor belts and pipes you can build up foundations put the pipes there delete the support delete the foundations and it's floating if you want right so it really is up to you if if if you feel that trains should have supports you can just kind of make your own, and that kind of just works because normally the tracks go on the ground yeah but I don't know like I can sort of see yeah I don't know I don't think I don't think they need their sports but you can always leave that's a suggestion on the qa site interesting thing to think about train supports we want it
