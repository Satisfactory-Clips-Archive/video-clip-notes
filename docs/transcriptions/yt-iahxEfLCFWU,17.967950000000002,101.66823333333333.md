> hi everyone my name is snooted i'm one of the community managers here at coffee stain studios and i'm reporting live from massage 2 a b b b b a b doo whatever this planet is i don't know uh yeah anyway um so yeah today we're going to release a an updated game on the experimental branch that we've been referring to as the fluids update and we've looked at some of the things that we felt were missing from update three as well as in taking some feedback from community and decided to give fluids a second iteration as well as some general uh quality of life features that we've been working on and just chucked that into the game now instead of baking it into update four which will drop early next year if you don't know how to access the experimental branch on steam you hit the properties time for the game you choose the betas tab and then you select experimental in the drop down menu and on the epics games version there should be like a satisfactory experimental game available in the list uh the experimental version of the game is a bit uh experimental so you it might contain some issues that we'll be sorting out in the coming days uh and it should be available on the early access version of the game in a couple of weeks so this update shouldn't affect your current saves too much and we'll go into detail about this further in the video so let's check out some of the changes in the update all right come on let's go i'm walking away this is so dumb so yeah this is the packager building this bad boy can pack and unpack so many liquids and this replaces the packaging functionality that we've had in refineries up until this point as we didn't have enough time for update 3 to make a new building to handle that we're adding it now as prompted by community request and the difference being that the packager is a much smaller building and it consumes less power 10 megawatts to be precise and it fits perfectly on a single foundation and is less than three walls high how about that huh the package is the first building to have inputs and outputs above one another and this is to reduce all the criss-crossing of belts and pipes while setting up like a large row of them and it's a bit of a test case for us so please make sure to let us know if you like this or not now if you've already set up any refineries to handle packaging and unpackaging don't worry because any legacy refinings built in the game will still function like before but you will not be able to select these recipes in any refineries constructed from this point on let's keep moving now you all want a pipeline mark ii and well here they are the new pipes are still the same size and they can be upgraded for mark 1 pipes the same way you can update conveyor belts and have a maximum flow rate of 600 cubic meters per minute and uh that's as good as going to get folks because we have no plans for mark 3 pipes and even if we did were to add that the maximum flow rate would still be 600 due to technical limitations now of course we can't add new pipes without adding new pumps these suckers have a maximum recommended head lift of 50 meters and consume 12 megawatts of power and on this topic we've also changed the size of mark 1 pumps by scaling them down roughly 75 of the original size because we felt they were clipping too often for players so when placing pumps you also have the ability to rotate them placing them exactly the way you want and we also added visual feedback off the head lift so you can now see the distance when placing them we've even made it so that you can snap pumps to that distance from each other so you no longer have to count like walls or anything like that to get the maximum head lift now in last week's teaser video you may have spotted this little doohickey at the end of the video and this this is a valve and they will allow you to limit the maximum flow rate of a pipeline so just slap it on a pipe and uh configure it and you're good to go valves don't consume power they do not stop head lift but they do stop backflow so they are directional now in this update we've also added some quality of life improvements to the game so let's check them out by starting with jump pads so instead of having two different sets of jump pads it's now just one buildable where you configure the angle of the jump instead so previously jump pads would just apply a uniform force on the player when they stepped up on them but now jump pads will instead calculate the force needed to hit a specific target making them much more reliable in addition to this we also visualize the player trajectory so you have an easier time figuring out where they're going to blast you and for some reason now you can also place these on walls and at the bottom of foundations we've also added so that when you're dragging wires from buildables the connector will now match walls and ceilings depending on what you're aiming at and yes we're adding the ability to place power mounts on ceilings now and last but not least we're adding ladders to the game magyad their height can be adjusted and they can also be attached to walls and at the bottom of foundations so yeah a lot of cool stuff uh for the full patch notes make sure to check out the link in the description below and uh don't forget to follow us on ro socials and whatnot and make sure to smash that sub www button and until next time have a good one this is snoot reporting live from massage 2a bbb dvd 1945. um bye wow we're flying whoa check that out whoa
