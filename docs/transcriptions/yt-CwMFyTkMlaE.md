> can you guys make it more obvious that project parts need to be used in future project parts so we build proper factors ahead of time instead of slacking and hanging ourselves right later that's a pretty good point I don't I don't know if we necessarily have to do that but I totally feel that frustration I think that's a valid concern there, qa site my dude leave that suggestion there you know like it's not me that you need to convince right, so that's why I say that I think I think that's a very valid bit of feedback I don't really know how we would work around it or if we actually want to but I think it's definitely worth putting out there
