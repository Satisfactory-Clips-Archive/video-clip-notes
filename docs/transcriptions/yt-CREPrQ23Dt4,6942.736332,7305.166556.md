### Transcript

> you want to show it, the resourcing Edition yeah yeah so, awesome sink, so we changed, this was actually gonna come in update six originally but we didn't have time to add it for update six, so there's like new two tracks now, I should have I wish I had weapons oh I do have weapons I'm gonna go kill that thing and go find your body or my body it doesn't show up on the I think it might just be like one of those are disabled actually that might be a compass it might be a thing where yeah we don't show offline players, if you go towards the big waterfall but also be creatures there yeah let's do that, we've changed to that like there's new two, two tracks of of, coupon points now so when you're making DNA capsules which we also change the name of him apparently, they used to be called they were always called this sure, they they serve a separate purpose now instead of just being part of like unlocking stuff in the map they also give you separate coupon points rewards thingies so, it's it's like good because like if you already have a lot of coupons and and and you want to get more, it will still be effective let's see what happens here come back here easy see money you're a real tough guy now aren't you where did you where'd you put the thing, to the right to the right to the right it's a snail over there then across the river somewhere across the road again there we go we're gonna add robots to the game the row boats don't give them ideas dude why don't we get pizza to the game when are we getting pizza at the office that's a bigger question yeah in an hour get that we're gonna have a big pizza party now you're right here now okay left sorry do that your other lift it's okay good thing no one was watching it's probably just a couple of I actually don't know how many pizza for everyone yeah yeah just show up at the office, wait where somewhere around here I think oh let's see yeah get on top of this dude get a good vantage point I was killed that guy don't kill that guy all right it's really easy yeah it's really not very hard is it oh it attack me wait maybe did you turn on retaliate yeah I think I did I sure hope you did yeah I should have cut the stream I'd be like yeah yeah I totally did yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

> where's this body I think it was more to you right now more on the dunes still he's just put in like a wild goose chase I think I can craft the cup I'm not sure if it's there though it's so weird as well because she just got my safe so you should have just no I think it is I think it's because I'm oh because it's a different it's a different session idea so, yeah man, and, since it's staging build I can't whoops I switched I can't to use the yellow any possess thing, so anyways so yeah let's make some hot protein let's make some splitter protein and then DNA okay so I wish now I kind of want to go back now because I want to put, the other stuff in the awesome sink as well but I can show it off here and then kill myself and, go back there, awesome sync and then we'll hook up to that totally there's a power source there don't worry about it, so yeah now you can put uhmj storage container all right think of a jig there we go I'm gonna put the DNA capsules in there actually I could put the other stuff here too so we can just show off real quick, this one updates every minute right it doesn't show like immediately like the curves I think here so so each DNA capsule is worth a thousand points and then, it ramps up like the more points you need for each level to generate a coupon but just from killing those animals I already got three coupons, which is pretty sweet actually, with that I can buy stuff very useful things such as beans and stuff so you can see here like compared to like the the low level stuff you get a lot of points for the DNA coupons, it Rams up pretty quickly so the idea is that you can get some early coupons pretty quickly yeah from some stuff you have left it's also of course is still the case that you need them for research like the alien remains so there's a bit of a thing like do I want to do the research do I want to get some coupons yeah but it's mainly just a way to yeah you saw a lot of players just leave of course the loot behind because that's no real purpose yeah after the early game so we figured why not just let them get some coupons this way so the players that like exploration maybe a bit more than others can get some coupons that way so if you have smaller Factory you can still just get all the Cosmetics you want or if you're that friend in the in the play party that there's always a factory building it just wants to run around you can still contribute a lot yeah if you're that person in the party that's like I'll get car drives then like this is for you okay that's my that's what I do every time we have our PlayStations now because I'm like I'm going up hard drive hunting wait oh is this still the alpha hog sound or is it the this sounds like that yeah yeah, we're gonna change because like right now all the Hogs do the alpha hogs sound we're gonna we're gonna change that up cool
