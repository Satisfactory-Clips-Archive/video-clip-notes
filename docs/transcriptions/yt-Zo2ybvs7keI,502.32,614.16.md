> hi my name is JC le if you don't know now you know your life is different now hi I'm Jason community manager here at coffee stain studios and today we're doing something a little bit different something new we're doing a Q&amp;A on Tuesday asked you all on Facebook Twitter and Instagram if you had any questions and boy you did so let's just jump straight into it and answer them let's start off at Facebook and I'm gonna start with strong with the name that I can't pronounce sorry about that but they've asked how are you doing yeah I'm doing good thank you very much next question is from Dylan Dylan else would you be interested in offering placement positions and maybe looking for new eager talent internationally yeah we have been actually we advertise a programming position here at coffee-stained like a month or two ago and we're currently hiring at coffee-stained north in stockholm and i'm pretty sure they're hiring internationally as well we certainly work coffee stain studios so like keep your eyes peeled on the social media because I do share it there but also check the job section on our website which is coffee stain se or coffee stain studios calm there's a job section whatever we have going there look at that and see what's available hi ganache what's the biggest challenge you face an average day-to-day activities do you hit walls how do you keep yourself moving forwards you know I can't speak for everyone here the companies all just speak for myself you know one work on big games for a long time it's it's kind of hard to imagine the you know the goal the end being in sight and so the way that I keep myself moving forward is to actually not focus on work so much try and just enjoy my life every single day make every day fun and enjoyable for me to live which also includes me working and I work at a great place so I enjoy working here as well and that's what makes it easy for me because if I can just enjoy day to day and take it one day at a time eventually the game gets done and then we get a big release and then a lot of happens and it's really fun so that's kind of how I do that Kamel asks am i handsome well camel you're gonna have to buy me a few more drinks before I can answer that next up leo asks can we get sanctum simulator instead well if you put sanctum on a virtual machine on your computer it's kind of like Thank You simulator so you can do that yourself lymph grand asks many people aren't aware of what the working conditions and business conditions are in Sweden would you say it's a nice place to work and a nice place to have a business in you've got a lot of questions they're slim so I'll start with that yeah it's definitely a nice place to work in you know I I missed ralien I lived in Australia I also lived in Japan for a few years and now I live in Sweden and Sweden has been the best place to work in my pi√±on best work conditions that I've had so far so whether or not it's a nice place to have a business in I don't really know I don't own a business here I just work here but there's an index that rates and I think in 2017 Sweden was like ninth or something like that I'll post the actual number here or whatever so slim goes on more specific to coffee-stained you have a more serious franchise sanctum as well as a complete bat ship WTFs franchise goat simulator did different teams work on those or did sanctum does miss their meds and creates going simulator in the process no different teams did not work on that it's the same team so after sanctum was done I think a few games sort of popped up that what they were thinking of making I wasn't there at the time so I'm not too sure but a few games came up and goat simulator was one of them and that sort of kind of just took off and that was sort of it but yeah it's the say it was the same development team honestly if you look through sanctum one end - you can see you can find a lot of silly stuff in there you know the humor and the the wackiness of this studio was present from the very beginning that's that's for sure and lastly also it looks like third-party devs worked on the development part of several of your more recent projects namely a story about my uncle the West Point independent deep broth Galactic are you moving toward a more publisher only role or do you still have an actual development team working on games so those games were we did not develop those at all we only publish them we have under the coffee stain brand there's coffee stain studios which is where I am right now we are a development studio and there's also coffee same publishing which is separate ish to what we're doing here they kind of do their own thing and so they published those games but those games were completely developed by their own studios so we had basically no hand in that at all in terms of coffee stain studios you know where I am now are we moving towards a more publisher only role not at all that's the publishing side coffee stain studios is still making games Ethan asks any plans to ever bring goat simulator iPhone and Android only levels to the PC version currently as far as I can tell there were no plans to do that any plans for a future goat simulator DLC or sequel slash another goat simulator game yes there's plans for a future goat simulator content Lina asked will you consider working on a brand new fabulous something similar in the future or is that off the hook you know if we're looking for a game to make and the best game to make is a something simulator then we'll do it the cool thing is that we're actually an indie studio we don't actually have a publisher apart from coffee-stained publishing which is us so we have the freedom to do whatever we want if that is the best thing that we deem for us and we're gonna do it Adrian asks when will we see goat simulator VR there are easier ways to induce vomiting Adrienne you don't need good simulator VR Sam asks are we going to get another absolute gem like a story about my uncle that was a great game and I hope so I not to say that we haven't I think the other games that we publish have been really good but yeah of course we're always off to really really good games like that so now let's move over to Instagram Jimmy records asks what programming language do you prefer develop but I have when applying for a job at coffee-stained C++ I guess we mostly work in Unreal Engine 4 and the engine is in C++ so if you don't know that you can't work in the engine so I'm definitely C++ Jim Henry sauce who is a better colleague Natalie or Hannah come on Jim I cop pick a better cut level who's my favorite colleague I can't I gotta do that on the video nonetheless it's Natalie Ian Varley a suspiciously familiar surname asked what's up not much because I'm shooting a video David Belcher knows how do you feel about your studio I feel great about my studio it's on my studio but yes it's nice here we have a cinema now we're moving over to Twitter armory arm in arm in a Bryce sigit Armand de bris sick Arisa check it bruh psychic a Ibrahimovic asks if aliens came to earth what would the best response from humanity be obviously kill them arm and you know this young gun o-360 are the first two letters of your next game's title really essay what they're referring to right here is an image that I posted on on Monday and the answer to the question is yes actually the first two letters our essay I was just trolling you guys a little bit there but that is true and that really is the game that we're working on right now by the way some people were asking why isn't their super sanctum TD in the coffee's same section of this image the reason is because this is an image taken by one of our testers and they don't have super sanctum TD that's why they didn't put it there or if they do they didn't put it in that category it's it's no like we made that and then cut super second TD out no weird funny business going on there it's your boy asks a great question how does guy autumn get her scars for those of you who don't know whose guy autumn is she is one of the characters from sanctum one and two and yes she's pretty badass alright so I'll read an official part from from the character profile for this subscribe as a teenager she stole real guardian and went out on her own to explore the wilds and hunt creatures that lived there while she was told off by her parents and teachers she still gained respect from her peers when she came back like some action here with cuts on her face and huge beasts claws a trophy that she gladly showed off tra Torrez Studios asks thoughts on current game industry situation when now 30 games are released on Steam daily how new Indies can it how can you induce adapt to this situation I'm not an authority in this and I can't really say too much that is gonna be actually correct all I can say is good luck friends but you also go on to say also what's your favorite character from sanctum there's this guy mine is sweet sky sister sweet autumn and she's really cool I liked how she was super playful I loved her rocket launcher I would always play sweet Daniel the dorito dragon asks is it true that you built a golden statue of a goat in Japan sure stay-at-home cat that asks is there someone at your office who is like a super underappreciated kitchen hero who always prepares coffee for the others and if yes who we should have coffee gnome appreciation days yeah we did / do you know a lot there was like a few people in the studio who was like going on doing everything and a lot of other people who weren't but that you know we we talked that out and now we're trying to get more people to take up a lot of the responsibilities as well so that it's like everyone in the studio should be doing a little bit and not just a few so you're right no coffee no appreciation days would be good to have better yet everyone is a coffee gnome but also we don't actually have to make our own coffee because we have the coffee machine that either serves tasty coffee or breaks for booze Coffee asked coffee or tea I think the studio answer would be coffee coffee stain a lot of people here drink coffee but personally I like to drink tea I've got a few other tea drinkers here too and then we also have question here by pixel sanctum 3 question mark sanctum 3 question mark any sanctum 3 gameplay' any news on sanctum 3 can weave a trailer for sanctum 3 how far along is sanctum 3 yeah so we get a lot of questions about sanctum 3 a lot of people just assume we're making it and I and I don't think that the image that I shared on Monday helped much but whether or not we're doing section 3 I'm actually going to tell you we are not making sanctum 3 right now Oh No please don't hurt me so obviously we know that everyone wants sankt 3 you know we won sanctum 3 - it's it's it's honestly a good idea I couldn't find someone in the office who wouldn't want to make it honestly we would like to make it and we know that you all wanted as well so hopefully one day it happens right but basically you know we came to a time where we could choose what we want to do next sanctum 3 was one of the options and it was a good option it was one of many options we brainstormed a lot of different game ideas and even though sanctum 3 is a good idea the game that we're working on now one over sanctum 3 so we are doing this game because we really believe in him and we're really passionate about it and we've been working on it really hard for quite a while now I know that's disappointing to hear for a lot of you but the future is bright I think our sanctum fans will really like the game that we're working on and you know in a way I also don't want to just leave you disappointed like that I I'm saying all this is because very soon like really soon we're gonna be teasing information about what we're doing so you don't have to wait long for some news and when we do I honestly am think I'm really confident I'm sure that you will at the very least you will think it is satisfactory and then I also hope that you think it's amazing so for what it's worth it may not be what you're expecting but it is gonna be something cool and I'm sure of that okay so that's all the questions for today I want to thank everyone for asking questions it was a lot of fun make sure that you follow us on Instagram Facebook Twitter and subscribe here on youtube all the links to everything is down below in the description because as soon as we release any information about what we're working on next you want to be up to date with it right away right so consider doing that so you can get that information as soon as possible alright and thank you very much for watching the video today and I'll catch you guys next time bye bye what did it feel like when you made the decision to announce sanctum 3 this Friday also how excited do you think the community will be when they learn that consoles
