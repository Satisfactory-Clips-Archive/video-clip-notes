> low-end pcs both gpu and cpu side yeah of course there are constantly optimizations- I know that the optimization front and yeah I talked about optimization before but we'll talk about it a little more, the optimization front is never obvious because optimization is constantly going but most folks will never realize it because it's tiny tiny steps but if you rewind back to six months ago and check out the game you you'd notice a huge difference or a year ago it's it's light years, better okay maybe not light years that's a bit of an exaggeration but it's better it's much much much better, so yeah it's one of those things that you can't feel it as you know day to day or for every little update but, it is happening and so, we do care about the low end pcs too we're not just targeting high npcs we're not but high-end pcs will always perform better
