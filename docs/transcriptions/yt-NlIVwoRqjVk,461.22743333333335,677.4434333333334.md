> yeah we're working on so why did you sign an exclusivity deal with epic wasn't for the money understandable especially if the amount was large enough or were there personal reasons no slander or hate but I just wanted to hear the reasoning from dev thank you for not slandering or hating yeah so we answered this question way back when we became exclusive with epic but it that's been some time so I'll just I'll just rehash it real quick of course there was the money aspect I'll talk about that lost I want to say a few things first and that is that there were a lot of other things that we sort of supported with that move you know from the support for content creators, the revenue share obviously the standard at the moment is like 30% revenue share of your money just goes to the platform and it's fair that the platform takes money you know sistema steam does the 30% thing but 30% is a lot of money and so epic has been offering 12% and that is much much better and and so that we wanted to support that movement for potentially better revenue share within the industry as a whole as developers we also think of the well-being of developers and we think it's important that developers make money like that they that they get a better share from from what they're doing so so we think that's pretty good as well now you know we now I say that but now we're going to steam right so are we going back on it I don't know maybe right but but the the other reason really was you guys as well like like we heard you guys like so many people wanted steam and we wanted to do right by a lot of folks we really did think of you guys and you know this is not me just like spouting some [ __ ] to make you feel important like it really was I remember the conversations you know III was there like I was part of it and you guys were important in that decision very important in that decision so I just wanted you know said thanks for that and we sort of also think about you guys as well for why we went to steam now the last thing is obviously money yeah of course there's that now the the reason and you know again this is one of those things that people will say he's the PR guy don't believe but the fact of the matter is when it comes to the money it's scary releasing this it was scary released in this game you know we spent years working on this and it's a factory game you don't know if your factory game is gonna recoup three years of money let alone make any kind of reasonable profit to keep us going for like longer right we don't we we have we had no guarantee we didn't know we you know we knew the game was good but you just don't know if that's gonna take off and we did so I guess in hindsight maybe we didn't need it but we don't regret it because we still don't mind being on the epic store it it really is about security and it's it's that's why there are a lot of devs who are people going there- I think it's not just me it's not just money in the pocket like I can assure you that it's not just we want to make more money I can assure you that it's more likely security you know is a studio gonna be open can we keep paying rent you know that is a huge part in it remember that world humans as well especially when it comes to management you know how manages and stuff like that they're really awesome and you got to remember that their priority is is to ensure all the people in the company have a job you know they're gonna take care of us and and you know so they're they're doing that- I can assure you it's not about it's not about just getting rich I can I can assure you but people would believe that I understand that too a more lighthearted thing
