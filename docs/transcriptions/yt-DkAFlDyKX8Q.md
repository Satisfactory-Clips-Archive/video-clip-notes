### Transcript

> produces such absolute bangers like valheim deep rock and satisfactory, I mean coffee stain didn't develop valheim or deep rock but they did satisfactory obviously published the other two games so all credit goes to those developers yeah, iron gate for valheim and ghost ship games for deep rock and then coffee stain studios made satisfactory, why do we make good games I don't know just because we do look I guess we're lucky yeah well you know I always reduce the luck because my tiny brain can't really figure out why but it's weird that you know like do you just keep getting lucky maybe yeah yeah maybe just continually getting lucky as a thing I don't know but maybe there's something that we do that is right as well who knows I definitely think there's, working at different studios you can definitely see like people do it differently and and coffee stain yeah I feel like you know the studios that that I've worked at were you know they've had great games they've sort of had sort of the same not mantra but like there's like some common denominator but it's like really hard to like take apart exactly what it is other than like focusing on making good games first you know making sure that like these are games that I would want to play, so yeah also taking care of the people yeah that's also a huge part you need to empower those people yeah but but there's definitely also an aspect of like, because I've I've seen games that other people have worked on that were not like huge hits but they're really good games and you're just like why is this not a hit like this is such a good game, so I don't know yep so it's it's a tricky question yeah I don't get it
