### Transcript

> this is this is a good point actually because we do need more feedback on this because one of the big things that we're wondering still is like how do players want to build yeah with these maybe you have like a crazy idea of combining Blueprints and then we need to somehow make sure that the system does accommodate that yeah exactly, because I haven't said this actually but this is important I'm gonna go to the full screen for this part but, yeah this is the first iteration of the release of blueprints like we are going to be equipment working on this, we actually wanted to do a little bit more for this release but we really really wanted to release at the end of this year so usually what we do is we delay you know if you feel like we're not happy with the release we usually delay and it's not like we're not happy with this release but it's more like we want to do more things I think with Luke Princeton, what we have right now I think this is a pretty solid like first iteration though but there's more coming is what I'm trying to say, I can't say exactly what's coming because it kind of depends a little bit of of timing and production but also a little bit on you guys like when you feed kind of feedback we get, because you know it's kind of like we haven't had that much time to ourselves to like try and see what how what kind of emergent design that comes from this yeah and I think that's, that's kind of the problem and we knew that when when getting into it as well that we were not going to be able to finish it to the Quality yeah because we normally go for but we wanted to get it basically in player's hand so we can see how people start using it so we don't waste time developing features yeah like that yeah yeah that's a waste of time check up our background oh yeah that we waste time on stuff that people don't even care about and then you know yeah and it's going to impact the game to such a big extent it's kind of important that we get as much feedback as we can before we reach our 1.0 deadline here's the dedicated server by the way it's it's on
