### Transcript

> is an end of if an end of a train is sticking out from a block then shouldn't the previous block still be reserved too yes that's what will happen so if any like I said in the video if any part of the train is in a block then that block is technically occupied so while a train is like traveling between the you know the the border of two blocks then both those blocks are occupied by that train yeah and you can see that in the teaser video, when the train is arriving, here you see that like that oh geez that was loud for me well you can see that like as soon as this train line here enters fully the block that's when the path thing is like all right it's clear you can go, it's like obscured obviously here but yeah that's essentially what happens so like as soon as the last card enters the segment that's essentially when this turned green
