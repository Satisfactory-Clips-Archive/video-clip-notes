> any news about the cup oh I don't know what the status is actually we we, you sort of told me about it yeah there's there's I think I talked about this on stream last week but I'll do it again, we have been making a lot of progress in the cup, if just a quick quick recap of why the cup has been taking so long is because the the it was kind of tricky for us to like nail down exactly how we wanted to make the cup because we we we were like at the beginning we wanted an enamel cup and we really set on that but then due to like production issues we couldn't get like the exact colors that we wanted, and then we're like oh bummer but we can make a ceramic cup that is like correct in terms of colors but it's a ceramic cup and it feels like but the cup in the game isn't a ceramic cup and it felt like a bit weird, so we've been going back and forth a little bit about that I need to sneeze jeez
