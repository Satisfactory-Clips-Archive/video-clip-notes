>, yeah i don't know i don't i don't think you guys should ask us questions about analytics because i don't think we know anything well i implemented the analytics i actually know everything about them you know but you know the results i mean, yeah i do people asking about results oh you do okay well the the thing with the results is that it's, it's very hard to know the problem with analytics in general is that it's very hard to know you know like the example someone brought up of like how do you know if what if 90 of people replay the game then you're not really getting you know data from new players you're getting data from from existing planes that replay the game and then you're getting like faulty data so to speak and you know the analytics isn't the only thing that we look at when we decide on things with the game like if you look at the data that's on analytics and see like oh that takes eight hours on average for every player to get to tier four and then we look at like but what's the highest time it's like 50 hours and then yeah so it's really hard to know you know what the truth is and what you can do there is you can do something called inferential statistics where you calculate how high the probability is that you've actually collected accurate data from proper group of people and we've done that from time to time but honestly like we just kind of shoot from the hip a lot of times we look at the data on analytics and we're like okay there's there's one data point and then we talk to people in the community and say okay that's another data point we play it ourselves and try it out and say okay that's another data point so it just becomes one data point in many things that help us decide what we do with that so like the analytics isn't super actually like helpful actually, in that sense because but you can find you can find value there sometimes yeah yeah that's good exactly as a tool and then there's also the aspect of like what if i implemented it incorrectly like what if the data points are over stacking so we're getting multiple you know data entries that are incorrect that's also something we have to think about when we look at that where is the goddamn hole i can't say that you missed it yeah i better i think i did but i can't, i'm just going to go yeah so take an organized approach exactly so like we we get some value from it but it's not like the end of the world if we didn't have it you know what i mean, and that's that's really all there is to it honestly
