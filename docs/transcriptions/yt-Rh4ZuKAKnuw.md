### Transcript

> why would you pick vulcan over dx12 and vice versa I don't know just do your research and see which one you like yeah it depends on your hardware which one is better or supported but my guess is that dx12 is probably the better supported version right right now because vulcan is still sort of in development there's a few things that are like aren't supported in vulcan yet, but we'll probably like the the the the main difference between vulcan and like everything else is that like vulcan has the potential to be a lot better than some of the because of they've like drastically changed how the rendering pipe works whereas a lot of other ones have like worked on like older iterations, whereas vulcan is like sort of ground up changed how it works but I think what I've seen is that a lot of people have had in better support using directx 12. there's also like if you're playing the game on linux then vulcan is pretty much your only choice because directx isn't supported there
