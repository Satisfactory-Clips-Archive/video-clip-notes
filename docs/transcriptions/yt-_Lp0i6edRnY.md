> um do you release holding back these all secrets or do you die a little time inside every time you ask i actually die a little every time people ask because i don't i don't like i don't really like keeping secrets that much like i actually don't like it at all i don't know if anyone really does but it's uh it's kind of just the best way to do things uh at the moment for the most part you know like with update three we didn't say anything that was even worse where we were just like nothing's happening but a lot was happening at least now we get to give you stuff you know a little bit like every week bit by bit um it sucks to not be able to answer everyone's questions all the time but uh it's tricky because there's two things right like when we answer questions and give information um we have to like on like for like our marketing or community engagement purposes it's better to give a little bit over time right and build this hype slowly over time that's sort of like good for the game good for the update all that kind of stuff even though people want more and more and more but that's kind of what sort of fuels that sort of hype and what gets people engaged so like we sort of like we want to sort of take advantage of that a little bit right but there's also the aspect of um

> god i actually forgot oh yeah yeah so there's also the aspect of not like a lot of a lot of questions that people ask we have a vague idea like i can go to i can go to mark and i could go ask him you know one-on-one and he'll be like yeah probably this uh probably yes we talked about this last week and we thought this was pretty cool we'll see what happens later like a lot of these you know questions that you guys are asking we may have somewhat answers for them but none of them are like set in stone like we're back and forth and flipping flip-flopping on things all the time so it's it's like we we also just can't give you some of these answers because if we do we either lock ourselves into something that eventually we come to realize we don't like you know like maybe we say we're gonna put a feature in and then we tried and we didn't like it but then we said that we were gonna put it in now what do we do do we cut it completely but people's hopes are gonna be up they could have this idea of this really cool thing even though we think you know what i mean it's really hard so we can't we can't just say everything because the details might change or some ideas that we have that we think are cool now might not come out later so we can't i can't just answer all the questions and it sucks it really does suck it's probably the worst part of my job i wish i wish we could just talk about all the stuff that's coming along but you know and then there are times that i'm just like i don't know and then sometimes i the second i say that i'm thinking actually i do sort of know but i can't say anything now i just lied to everyone and now i feel bad about it you know like oh i i don't know what to do i don't know what to do man it's like i just can't tell you i just can't say answer some questions it feels bad
