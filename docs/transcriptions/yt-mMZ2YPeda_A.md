> what is one of the bigger risks facing the game in the next 12 months like engine changes or infrastructure issues I don't really know if we have a risk I think we're kind of in a good situation that I mean there's just like a couple real big things that I don't know I feel that are big but maybe the team feel like are completely manageable like story is going to be pretty huge like I feel like that's going to be a tough thing to make and then you know implement correctly but you know I believe in the team, mod support I'm really curious as to how that's going to pan out but I don't think there's any other sort of risk apart from that I think we're we're really lucky that you know we've had so much support from you guys that we can just like like freely just take our time and make the game as good as it can be and just take whatever time that means, and we're really lucky not not not a lot of the studios have this kind of luxury and it's all because of your support folks thank you thank you so much
