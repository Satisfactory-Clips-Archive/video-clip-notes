> here's the game when we stop make update for language translation and patch this broken map, we will update the game in a timely manner when it makes sense, so you've got broken map and big capital letters there i think you're exaggerating a little bit i don't think it's that broken i'm sure there's some stuff that's glitchy, and we actually have the world update on the sort of separate development branch which is going to come, when that sort of makes sense which is not really an answer i can really give, and when that comes there'll be a bunch of changes to the world which might address some of it but i'm sure there's still going to be some of those glitchy areas it's going to happen but we will work on it, and just just so you know, so you're saying like stop stop updating language and fix the map it's not like it's not it's not like we can't fix that we're too busy fixing, the language right they're on two completely separate teams they don't impact each other in any way shape or form so if we stopped updating the languages you wouldn't get the map quicker they just wouldn't be language updates right so yeah dude speaking of that something that jarred my memory i haven't seen like, stop tweeting and fix the thing yeah we haven't heard that in a while i have that in a while like yeah people like stop stop making videos and just optimize the game yeah i just make videos dude like if i stopped doing this i wouldn't be optimizing the game i just wouldn't be making videos yeah exactly
