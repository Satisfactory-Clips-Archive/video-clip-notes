### Transcript

> so let's talk about the future now you might be asking yourself what's coming next and the answer to that question is i don't know there's still a few hot fixes we want to do for update four we're currently working on those and rolling them out as i mentioned before but we have been moving on to update five actually and that's like our next target here we're gonna work on update five but we don't know when that's coming out because we're kind of still figuring out what we wanna put in update five and how big update five is gonna be um and that's something that we're gonna be figuring out while we're working on update five essentially so we don't have like any news yet we are obviously gonna announce stuff once we can but it's still a little bit too early to like nail down exactly when it will happen or what it will contain it's it's gonna be sometime this year okay but we don't know like if update 5 is going to be a smaller update than update 4 or a bigger one or same size um or what that's going to entail etc etc so we're just gonna have to wait
