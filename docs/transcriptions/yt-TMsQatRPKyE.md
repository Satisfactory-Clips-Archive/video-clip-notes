### Transcript

> um so yeah and the next thing i guess we can talk about here on the bilmos is the soft and hard clearance which is uh has been super like a lot of positive feedback on this yeah um i'm actually surprised i'm not surprised but like i'm i'm stoked to see that so many people are are hype about this um i mean i think i i think it's it's like natural basically we're just giving people more freedom to do more things and so you know especially the people who really do you know there are people out there who don't give a about how their factory looks or they're not really creative in the way that they build i'm sort of one of those people like i'm a little bit careful but you know i i'm not i'm not super creative about it but i know that the people that are immediately see all the possibilities with this whole soft clearance um edition anyway we should explain what soft and hard clearance is for people who maybe haven't seen the video right so you go for it yeah so so what what soft and hard clearance is so um different buildables will now have be classified in two different ways they may have hard clearance or soft clearance the things that have hard clearance are things like uh buildings that have functionality so it can be manufacturing buildings it could be like the mam it could be power switch power poles things that you know whatever right um decorative items but also pipes and conveyor belts they have soft clearance and now what these clearance levels mean is that uh two hard clearance objects cannot be built on top of each other um but two build like but a soft clearance can be built on top of um any other soft clearance piece and also any hard clearance piece so like they can intersect um with those pieces with the clearances of those pieces so um if you just go back a little bit here oh yeah yeah this is fine so you can see here that all these pieces these walls and these belts here they all have soft clearance they can be built in and around the particle accelerator like it doesn't matter however you couldn't build a uh constructor within the bounds of the hard clearance of the particle accelerator um because those are two hard clearance buildings intersecting so there's so there's still some limitations with what you can build and where and this is probably most apparent with um so here this is the constructor here uh you know you can't build it in that little space even though there's a space there it still intersects the hard clearance of the particle accelerator um and it's it's even more apparent if you skip ahead just a little bit just a tiny bit so they called generally yeah to the cold generators here because the cold generator has massive bounding books right because that that pillar that goes up uh so all that empty area there that you can see is considered hard clearance so you can build foundations across it now finally but you can't actually build like manufacturing buildings in that space so there's still a little bit of limitation there but you know that's hard and soft clearance and i think a lot of people see it to be you know um it gives you like a lot of options essentially yeah
