### Transcript

> hello good evening welcome bienvenue, hello super cool all right welcome everybody good eve good evening welcome everybody to, yeah the week weekly weekly dev times weekly dev stream it is tuesday it is 3 p.m cest yeah I was like is it I can't trust me, hopefully everyone's awake at this point, we are in europe but anyways yeah jason's face is muted welcome everybody to a very very special, devstream it is the first dev stream, since we unveiled the update six update update news thingy, six am in california jeez why are you up so early so early go to bed nobody deserves to be up at that godly hour yeah dev stream with actual content oh what is this this is the best time zone isn't it, yeah welcome everybody I don't even know where to start honestly because there's so much we have to get through in the stream today, it's actually kind of nutty, yeah dave has news so hopefully everyone had a good weekend I don't know why is there okay I just hear like a weird echo in my headphones but it's probably because I have something on that I'm not supposed to have on anyways, yes welcome to our weekly dev stream, where we talk about actually talk about the game actually talk about what's going on right now because we actually can't talk about stuff first of all jace is on vacation, we unveiled this information last week as well last like 10 seconds of the stream but yeah jace is going to be on vacation for two weeks and then it will be back again I think hopefully fingers crossed, in the meantime it's you're locked down here with me chat okay so you're you're gonna have to deal with that, and jace picked the best time to go on vacation too because we, last week I don't know if you guys heard the news okay if you didn't hear the news we have a command for this now update six right, last week friday we unveiled update six and it was a little bit of a different thing it was something that we've never done before is we actually show talked about the entire thing instead of like teasing it bit by bit we actually told you guys everything, there's a couple of reasons why we're doing it this way the main reason really, is because we are changing sort of how we're working on the game, we are focusing more on, the 1.0 release we are focusing on finishing the game right now, and as I mentioned in the video the problem with the main problem we've had making these up updates is that we tend to look at like okay we've made update four right let's make update five what can we do in like the loose time frame we have in between update four and five and then we sort of plan ahead for that and sometimes we plan you know some things some people do work on things that take longer and they're like they don't get to be included in update 5 or whatever the next update but essentially that's how we've been doing things up to now we've been thinking like okay if we're making a new update like what can we do in the time frame we have what will be exciting for people like what would be a cool update to make, and when we were making update five we were kind of like in a weird, like middle ground it felt like to us at least where we felt that like that the update 5 wouldn't be like a grand update because like we're not adding too much update 5 we're adding like cosmetics and we're adding like a couple of changes to the build system but like compared to the previous updates which have included like a lot of content for the game, it didn't feel like same sort of vein of update as the previous ones which is really, scary for us in a way because there are expectations set on us when we are making these releases you know and if we don't live up to those expectations people are gonna be like no coffee saying if dropped the ball and this game is gonna go to shambles right, so we were really kind of worried about that and we were actually thinking of doing the approach we're doing now for update five and we had like a lot of like emergency meetings, right before teaser season started off for update five with like what are we doing man should we, what do we do, but it ended up not being the case for update five, it worked out well but you know once we've gotten update five out of the way and we started looking at the planning again, we sort of felt the same way as before right we felt that like okay but we we always do this we always kind of move the goal post between updates like the the intention for us is to reach a point where we feel happy with what satisfactory is and so we can like actually say like this is the final product this is released version of the game this is 1.0, and it is really hard for us to plan for that if we have to like run a marathon in between the updates that we have, and the conclusion we kind of came to was that we don't really have an option we have to sort of plan ahead for the release because we can't really fit updates in between then and work in the same way we have to change how we work, and from our point of view it's always been for us the game kind of comes first in in almost every regard, at like how we work on it so you know even if it's not exciting and we can't make these like big updates anymore, you know we think it's more we think it's going to pay off in the sense that like the 1.0 release is going to be really good because the 1.0 release will be sort of a grand release of the game it'll also be a couple of new things, but the road leading up to that will probably be a bit like different I guess and we don't really know how it's going to be different we just know that this update is going to be a smaller one because some of the work that we're doing are leading over update six so like the majority of people are working on the final version of the game a lot of people are also working on the things that we're going to see in update six so, so that's where we are right now, this sounds sad I'm just serious, because I wanna I wanna ingrain like that you know the stressful part for me and jayce is managing expectations of these updates right so like it's we are gonna probably get some flack for doing it this way, from people that like barely like where even update5 was like oh there's a small update like whatever, you know and and fine if people feel that way like it's not, you know people are free to feel how they feel you know, so, what was what was the point of all this I already forgot but, yeah so that that's why I'm I'm being serious here guys this is important okay, like the the update that we're working on right now which we're labeling is update six, is is not gonna be like a grand update as the previous ones, it might still be like a significant change to the game I think, I honestly don't know too much about it apart from like the overall high level information I've already given you guys, because I haven't really delved in and tried it out yet, but I think it's gonna be pretty cool, this is serious this is my serious face all right so, so yeah that's that's the reason why we're doing this and I think we need to sort of, I think we're gonna have to kind of like have to hammer on this nail for a bit next couple of weeks, just to make sure to that everyone's on the same page I know that you guys are probably on the same page because you guys have been here on the streams, and, you know you you probably like we already kind of talked about this before we even announced update six, I think a lot of people weren't surprised to hear that like this is gonna be like a smaller one and like we're working once whatever maybe people were surprised the fact that we were revealing so much information about update six, but but that's how it is, there's still a lot of exciting things to talk about the update though it's not like that video encompasses everything we haven't really gone into the details yet about update six, and I think it's gonna be really exciting to talk more about that too, and we will probably drop like a couple of snippets of information here on the stream we're trying to do the same kind of treatment on our youtube channel, dropping like you know cool updates on what we're working on, but right now we're in a phase where, not everything is finished like when we started the thesis season last time we were more in a finished state now things are more like in development but we're kind of okay with showing that and we're kind of keep talking about that because we want to you know be open about what we're doing and have this kind of like you know back and forth, about you about what we're working on and what our expectations are etc etc, so yeah that is that is, that is what's happening at the moment and, this is this is the most state of dave we could have given you in a long time, so hopefully you guys are excited, I'm gonna just quickly in case someone hasn't seen the video as well I'm just gonna really quickly just go through kind of, jesus or all right this stream is going to be stressful, tight stream okay but, essentially what we confirmed so far with update six is that it is all about the exploration aspect of satisfactory we're going to talk a little bit more about like what that actually entails because because we have game director mark, he's going to join us later and we're going to talk about we're going to talk more about like what the exploration aspect of the game means but also talk about the overclocking changes that we might do, so stick around for that but, so yeah the ex this update is going to be mostly about the exploration loop, there was a there was a it was like a screen if you guys saw the tools video we put out there we showed like the main game loop of the entire game and the way it works is like you have the factory loop with like you do factory maintenance and then you do have like the the you know the mathematical part of whatever like the layout stuff and the and then you have like the exploration group that's kind of like at the side of it, I wonder if I can bring it up actually and show you guys because actually it's kind of interesting it's something that when you're pitching, games you usually have to sort of nail download what the core game loop is, because the idea is that you can always like keep reiterating the main loops of a game satisfactory tools I don't remember it's probably in the game design part thingamajiggy one second chat one second tool game design

> [Music]

> it's one of the documents here microsoft except cool very cool this is a this is a beefy video holy  41 minutes hope you guys watched it we put a lot of time into that all right I'm not finding it whatever, leaking coming into yeah leak from an old video were released but, yeah so the exploration route loop is is a part of the game that we've always sort of like pushed aside a little bit and it's also something that we always knew that we're going to come back to, because the exploration loop is a part of the game like it's a pretty I wouldn't say it's not a core like it is kind of core loop but it's like it's not supposed to be the main emphasis of the game it's not it's like it's a it's a it's a, what's the word not the leading man of the game right it's it's a side character or not, and it encompasses like the the whole exploration aspect of like the planet the fact that you're on an alien planet, we like part of this also is like the the whole like story aspect of the game potentially as well which you know you won't see until 1.0, so you won't get that the full treatment really, but you know when we have been working on this the exploration aspect for us we've been working on things for 1.0 which is going to be tied to the story, and that's why you know we want to release that part with the final release of the game we don't want to like drop parts of it because we feel like that would sort of ruin the experience for a lot of people, we're ruining experience enough as it is being in early access for some people, just kidding but, so so like we're we're not including this in that outtake like the story part but we are including like the other aspects of the exploration loop and the exploration group isn't just necessarily that like we're making the world you know more interesting you know we're improving the environment and stuff like that it also goes back to like the aspects of the game like the gameplay that is affected by the exploration loop right so that is also something we want to improve, and due to sort of planning wise we also won't be able to fit everything that we originally wanted in update six so some things are going to come later down the line as I mentioned in the video too we will be working on this game a bit longer in experimental so it won't be like it'll probably take a bit longer for it to get out of experimental because we might do like the initial bunch of stuff that we planned for update six push that into into experimental and then we might keep like tweaking and working on things and introducing new things while we're in experimental and then we're happy we might push it over to ea but nothing is set in stone yet regarding that so that might also change because yeah if you haven't noticed we're going to try and be very like adaptive and agile to to to to this particular part of the section of the game, because we kind of need to so like the final final release of update six, on ea might not come until like way later, down the line, sometime like I don't know august maybe I don't know, we'll see so, so so yeah that's, that's the crux of that, let's see so yeah- I completely sidelined so so yeah the expiration loop is a big pretty big part of update six, we are introducing a new biome in update six as we've tasted about this video for a long time we haven't talked we haven't shown anything from this biome yet I'm very excited for us to actually start revealing stuff but we have a new biome set it actually is significant like a significantly different biome compared to the previous ones it's not a snow biome though, but I think it's pretty cool I already saw that coming when people in chat all right anyways, so so so there's going to be an update there's going to be a new biome there's also going to be like an update to the swamp area in the game and I mean I've seen the changes remain to the swamp area it's it's almost like it's a new biome honestly it is very different, so I'm looking forward to showing that as well, and there's also a couple of random areas on the map that we're also like kind of tweaking and updating, but you know if you've been with us before when you've seen these world updates you know that like they come in batches so when we do drop the update, you will get like an update to the world but there's more things to come it's not going to it probably probably the world probably won't be fully finished until we reach 1.0, and maybe even like after that we might do some tweaks but, there's still a bunch of areas in the game that we feel are unfinished we have shared that like map a while back and we might make an update to that map with the state of things as they are right now but there's a couple of, if you check our press kit and up the under update five, we have like a map where you can check out the state of things we also showed it in the video and there's a couple of areas that won't get many major changes but there's still a couple of like environmental tweaks and things that we're gonna update, so yeah the whole bible is floating that would be cool actually what if what if it is except it's not because you already showed it but, so yeah also just want to quickly say as well the by the new bio won't be as foggy I haven't seen too many people talk about that but I just want to confirm because I know some people have like you know getting triggered from like the previous updates or a lot of fog on the map the the fog was there to like tease it more so than like what the actual amount of fog that will be in that environment, it was mostly just so you guys wouldn't get like a clear image of it, can we get a fog biome that's pretty cool idea actually, so yeah, apart from that we also have plans to integrate like more, maybe potentially add some kind of weather mechanic to the game, specifically rain, we're not like 100 sure if that is actually gonna make it in because we've mostly been trying things out, it's been kind of promising so far though, but it all comes down to like how much time do we have left and if if there's enough time because one thing that we're adding to this game, to this update is is a huge revamp of the atmosphere, system, this is something that we were originally I think we were originally planning to update this in update five but we didn't have time and then the system kind of like took an even deeper improvement bigger improvement so the the the new atmosphere system that we have in the game are going to like completely replace the sky sphere so the sky sphere that you are seeing right now in game is like say goodbye to that because it's going to be completely changed, we have like dynamic dynamic like clouds and stuff generating and stuff and it's it's like it's so much nicer, and, yeah it's gonna be pretty cool
>
> [Music]

> and it's it's gonna be there's gonna be also a lot more like the biomes are also gonna be more sort of the atmosphere in each biome will also be a little bit more distinct I would say, when you're like moving from one biome to the other, colors will be more like unique to the biome and stuff like that so it's it's it's really cool I'm I'm really looking forward to showing you guys that, so, yeah let's see that's that so the next aspect that I want to talk about is creatures, like I mentioned in the video we have plans to, improve the creatures some people can I didn't give too much information here what that actually entails, because I did mention that we are changing how they behave we're changing we're updating the behavior we kind of reworked the entire ai system this is something that we've planned for a long time if you remember when we talked about the like issues we have with the pathing system and the ai in the game some of those issues are still being worked on, because we sort of did a bigger revamp of the overall ai in, for the game and this is something that I think we've communicated this past but this is a huge system rework that we've always wanted to do because we have we see a lot of potential in improving the creature behavior, so yeah the creatures are getting like a revamp and how the ai work, I can't tell you too much like exactly what differs because I haven't actually seen the the the the how it plays in action, but the major thing with the the the ai and the new creature behavior stuff like that is they're gonna be more like it's gonna be more clear what's going on, you know when you're fighting hogs it's gonna be more distinct like what's going on they're gonna animate more to like indicate like when they're doing charges and stuff like that, and so it won't be just like if you know exactly how to handle the hog you know it won't play the exact same time every single time you know we want to improve on that a little bit that being said the the the fighting aspect of the game isn't supposed to take over you know it's not supposed to be a you know a fighting game or a shooter anything like that but we still wanted it to be a little bit better than what it is right now, without it overtaking you know the the the how it works right now we're also doing an updated look on the, enemies in the game or the creatures in the game, some of them will will get like a kind of completely new look some will get just a revamp of their current look and if there's time you know we'll add more creatures, to the game so yeah but we won't be able to add the big crab yet unfortunately the the long-awaited big crab, it's required a little bit more work than we anticipated originally we also got more ambitious I think a little bit, because we're also trying to figure out like the the the what is the point of the big crab like it's supposed to be a boss creature or it's supposed to just be a big creature that roams you know or is it supposed to be like this you know cool encounter that you may only have like it's like we don't know at this point, and we're kind of like evaluating like what the what are the different approaches we can do there, so so that's the main reason why the big crap isn't if you're if you're curious about what I'm talking about when I say the big crab we unveiled in the 2018 reveal trailer I think I can find that, there was like one shot of this huge, enemy, and we haven't really shown anything of that enemy since then where are you it's at the end of the trailer right where are you it's like one of the it's like a super short snippet there oh found it where'd you go it's such a short like I have to almost there I found it all right, cool I always forget to set this up every every single time so this is this is a big crab that I'm talking about this is a this is a creature that we've teased you know in this update in that trailer and you've never seen it since right where is it I don't know it's just gone burn it we originally wanted to include this in update three, but due to the the need to upgrade the uai system, it just didn't work it didn't happen so so so this is a creature that we want to add to the game at some point but it probably won't happen in update six I mean I say probably I know it won't happen in update six, but just to give you guys an update on what's happening with that because I know a lot of people always ask about it the og players so to speak, so yeah and again we'll talk more about creatures when I know more but also we have things to show so probably a video, we also want to improve the the interactions with the map, ice in the video I say that we might change radar towers, correction we are going to change radar towers to make have like more of a significant like purpose in the game, I don't even know the radar towers do because I don't think I've ever used them in my own playthrough, but the sort of goal with the map changes that we're doing is that we want to we want it so that when players, are about to explore the map we want to give them sort of tools to be better to like set up expeditions almost and, you know give indications like where to go and stuff like that so the radar towers are supposed to to give you better insight as to like what's going on in the environment and like give you directions of like where maybe your resources are stuff like that I don't know exactly how it works I'm kind of hesitant to talk too much about it, but the the thing I wanted to communicate here is that the radar towers will serve a bigger function that they do right now, because right now they're just like they're they're cool looking but like what did they do, apart from revealing the map you know, we want them to serve a bigger purpose than that and that goes also with the map itself, we want that to to improve and be more useful for people but the the the map changes I have to also put emphasis on this, the changes we're making to the map will mostly be about the exploration after the game I know a lot of people want to have like you know sort of, satisfactory calculator interactive map sort of features where you can see like your factory layouts and stuff like that we won't be able to do that for this update, and I don't know if we'll be able to do that for any update but that is something that we also want to be able to do so that you you can use the map in in more useful ways for building as well, but for this update the the map will mostly have improvements regarding like expeditions and exploration and that kind of stuff, so yes, we're making equipment changes as well I think I talked about this in the video a little bit we're adding multiple body slots we're not 100 sure if this is going to make it into this update but this is something that we are working on this is highly requested I know some people were like geez it took so long for them to realize they just want to add the body slots we had like multiple body slots in back in the day for satisfactory I believe we even showcased this in
>
> [Music]
>
> an early build maybe but, yeah we the the reason why we removed multiple body slots was because we felt that you became a little bit too overpowered with the equipment and we sort of still feel that way but what we sort of, been doing, up until this point is we we've been kind of evaluating like how you know multiple bossless has always been an option to just add back into the game for us but we also want to check if like if are there other things we can do with the equipment system that makes that make sense that you know makes sense without us changing like the body slot system thingamajiggy and I think we've sort of evaluated a few things and and realized that sort of the best approach is really to add multiple body slots, and it might have seemed like obvious that like we should just done that just add more body slots that we asked for, we and and, you know we wanted to evaluate that system before we just just went with anything, and but I don't think we're not just gonna add like another body slot we're also changing a little bit how the equipment works too so so you won't get that like overpowered sense you'll still be able to do some of the things that you aren't able to do right now, for instance right now you can't use you know, the hover pack and build nuclear power plants at the same time for instance because you can't use the hazmat while using the hover pack you know stuff like that we want to we want to fix and hopefully we can fix the the when you wear gas masks in vehicles as well that's also something that was kind of tied into the equipment system and that was something it was a bug that was like kind of rooted in like the issue of the core system itself so we never elected to make like a temporary solution to that because we always knew that we wanted to revisit the equipment system and change how it works, and that is something that we are working on right now actually, but we don't know exactly exactly exactly what those changes are, but yeah that's something that we're addressing at the moment so to speak and we're making an update to weapons, I didn't mention too much about this and- I kind of wanted to use it a little bit too because it's kind of cool, it's not it's nothing like it's not gonna change the game overly and it's not gonna become like a base defense game but, but there's there's some cool additions to to some of the weapons that we have in the game, that I think is gonna be really cool to show show off, essentially, it also again ties into a little bit like how the equipment system works too because yeah there's a couple of things that we need to update in the system itself to make it work, and yeah lastly not lastly actually but then we also have a couple of technical improvements, for update six that will just overall like improve the game for people, hopefully we will make it so that like networking and foliage will be a lot better we're also hoping we'll improve like draw time for people so like you get better performance, we're hoping to improve, like yeah I mentioned the video like how we're handling how assets are managed in memory so hopefully yeah yeah that that should like improve rendering overall for people with bigger save files and stuff like that I don't know too much about these technical changes the systems, because they never told me too much about it but we are working on a bunch of steps as always- I feel like it's important to mention this because otherwise people might feel like we've forgotten it but we're all worth working on that stuff and then lastly one thing that we are considering doing I should probably clarify a few things about this and we will talk more about this later with mark, but we have we are considering doing a change to how overclocking works in the game, there's there's a few there's a few reasons why we want to change this but we'll probably go more in depth about it with mark but tldr is that the overclocking system is kind of like confusing for new players I know that a lot of all players really like the system, and and think that it like there's it's an interesting trade-off and we think so too you know we think that it's it's it serves a purpose but there's also issues with it you know and that's going to be the case with even if we do introduce linear, power management like that's going to introduce other issues, for some people you know so there's not going to be like at the end of the day I don't think everyone will be happy and I know that some people are requesting that like can't you do it so that we can maybe switch which one we want to use, and that is maybe possible later down the line but I don't think it will be too like possible right now maybe, with the way things are but when we're looking into you know game modes and stuff like that, this is some this is an aspect that we want to kind of like tie into that, so it's possible that we'll add feature for that or maybe we'll do like a config thing I don't know, but that is that is on the table just so you guys know, but we but one thing I should clarify too is that we haven't you know we sort of put out the the, the question to community right to you guys we are curious what you guys think and we've heard a lot of different discussions there's been a lot of really good discussions actually about the overclocking stuff from from both sides and it's kind of interesting how I think, I think it's kind of split, in terms of I don't think I think if you look at polls and stuff like that you will see that adding linear, changes to the overclocking system kind of overtakes it but- I think honestly when I'm reading the discussions it's it's kind of like it's very split in terms of what it actually what people actually gain from it and how people actually feel about it, and you know these are actually these are obviously things that we take into consideration more so than the fact that like you know majority of people vote on one thing or another because at the end of the day we're still going to like take all the information that we have and evaluate that and maybe we'll change it maybe we won't you know there's no even though most of the polls always are in the lead of changing it to linear that doesn't guarantee that we're gonna change it because a lot of people want it like we have to always think about like what is the best for the game overall, so yeah but we will talk more about this with mark later on because mark actually is the one who is thinking about this, and and you know he has the proper rationale behind everything, just listen to me and ignore the rest that sounds like the the way to go honestly yeah, so so, yeah we will see what happens with that and it might be the case where you know we might introduce this in update 6 and try it out and then maybe we'll change our minds you know it's that's hopefully we won't do do that because that might be affecting a lot of people but there's also an aspect of this discussion where it's easy to like speculate as to like what the actual implications are of introducing a system like this but when we actually try it out you know it might not be the case that it you know what we hypothesize about, might not come into fruition and it's a lot of cases like that in game dev where something might seem obvious and then when you try it out it's not at all obvious, so but but there's a lot of really good discussions about this, I think, we're gonna try and like organize a little bit better so that we have maybe like qa posts that we sort of lead people to towards, but you know right now I'm reading pretty much every discussion I find like on the steam forums and qa site and discord and and just like taking it all in, and I'm really pleased to see that there's a lot of like pretty pretty like, pretty decent discussion all around from people, sharing opinions about this, because it is not an easy it's not an easy like it's not a clear like this is obviously better like they're better in different ways, we always have to weigh like are they better in in ways that will influence like the thing as a whole or will it influence like a core set of people or will it influence like you know it's it's it's hard to like imagine sometimes when you're playing a game but people have very different experiences with games, and it's it's hard to like as a player and- I think about this a lot when I play other games it's hard for me to like be like how is everyone experiencing this game like you can't really it's hard to like imagine that you have to sort of just collect that data trust that the game developers are collecting that data and like making good choices around it so, so yeah we will talk more about that with mark anyways holy so so that is the that is the main crux of update six as of right now, or correct that's that's the content of update 6 any questions okay, holy so much we usually start community highlights like half past and we're like 50 minutes over time, so I'm thinking we should probably just like dive into community highlights I was actually considered not doing community highlights today because there is so much to talk about dave was stated that's for sure there's still a lot to talk about and it's it's it might be better to have this discussion with mark too about the different things about update six, so I don't think I don't think this one stream is gonna be able to like encompass everything that's going on it's honestly a bit overwhelming with all the discussions that are happening right now so let's take a break from update six for now we will get back to that
