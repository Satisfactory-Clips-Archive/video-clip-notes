> are there any plans to add VR in satisfactory after 1.0 I will be more than happy to pay for VR DLC, there are no plans for it it could be a thing it could be a thing that we do but I think right now that's super super low on priority it just really is I'm sorry I know you might like the idea of having VR and I think walking around factories in VR would be sick but, but yeah I don't see how that could be prioritized over anything else at the moment flat screen to VR Discord Community might do it they're amazing I have seen I have seen people who have VR wait is that what the other person said just think of the spiders yo that's terrifying, but no I have seen, VR versions of satisfactory before, but I'm not really sure to what extent that that had been done
