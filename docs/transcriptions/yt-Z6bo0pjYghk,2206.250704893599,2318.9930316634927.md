> yeah for sure all right so this is we're going to come back to huey now this is this is why this little rap I don't know if we can handle this no so huge made a post where they said like found a nice flat place to build oh yes more details in the comments oh yes well you're getting what you deserve okay this is not acceptable yeah so in the past huge is also built on like this place here a bunch of maybe it's here actually, trying to be funny like turn record oh recommending this site for the building it's super cool this is this is gonna get demolished soon in less than what is it where's the countdown like three hours two hours and thirty minutes kinda, if you boot it up on experimental that's up to you but, yeah don't build here basically yeah this is because this part is also gonna change we we we've told people a long time that this place is going to get renovated or changed, because you know it is sort of like obviously not done right like it's it's like very obviously well we I feel it's it's it's fairly obvious although putting a crash site there doesn't help with the situation no I was going to say it like yeah yeah it is a misleading yeah and that I think that crash site is going to get moved also so, and I think even if you collect it from the crash right you won't get another hard drive but I'm not 100 sure of that, I know for a fact that the nodes we hope are are not going to generate more oil than we already have because it's the same amount of nodes and it's, they've just moved unless we broke something else but which is you know likely yeah actually anything can happen but yeah shame on you for for teasing people
