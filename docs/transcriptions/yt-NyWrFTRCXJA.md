### Transcript

> oh this is great hang on, what do you think of a hard mode with production per minute requirement in the elevator yeah so I was thinking about this earlier when we were talking about hard mode I was thinking I didn't say it but like I was thinking like what would be a more interesting challenge is like forcing production per minute but that is something that I've heard people talk about before in the past, I think I had heard it talked about with respect to like achievements but it could be something that could be used for progression as well I think- I think it's, I think it's a pretty good route I think that's an interesting way of increasing difficulty and then you actually have to change the way you play it right you you simply cannot use the same, strategies that you would you would have used in normal mode in hard mode right if it was production per minute required I think that's a pretty good idea would match also, something that we also wanted to do is having like stats sort of so you can see like how your production lines are going something a lot of people requested like when we do that then it wouldn't be like too much of a stretch to be able to do yeah so they go hand in hand those two features yeah this by the way is this thing that we're sort of like sometimes looking for when we're designing the game when we're thinking of like where is our where's the bang for the buck when we're implementing features so like if there's a feature like that where you kind of get two features in one if we implement one of them those are much more worth implementing for us not saying that we're doing this specifically but like just a second example of our thought process it factors into the decision making for stuff it's it's not that we only do stuff that's bang for your buck but it's a valuable factor to consider
