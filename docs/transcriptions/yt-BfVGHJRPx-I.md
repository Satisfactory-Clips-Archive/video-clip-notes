### Transcript

> so yeah if you appear on stage together in person con or event would you be tempted to come on a cinemas and juice velvet you know like that that could be something funny if i know if we know that like our audience is gonna be full of people who know the joke you know what i mean but if if like like if if there's gonna be like if like 80 of the people in the audience are just like oh we heard you made a factory game like they're gonna be like what the [ __ ] are you doing juice velvet what you know city maze yeah so like i don't know that's that's the thing it could be funny but that's the thing with the passions videos really it's it's made but like the majority of people that are gonna be for experimental release are the people that are like in on you know the the streams that we've done or watched the videos that we put out they're in on the jokes like the majority of people know sort of who we are they're somewhat invested yeah they're they're somewhat invested so like it really works putting the passions video and the experimental release because that's when the die-hard people show up and they get all these jokes like if we were to go on e3 and just like announce satisfactory in like these kind of like in this manner it wouldn't work at all it would just be like who are these [ __ ] think they're funny murmur yes that's that's what the crowd sounds like at e3 there's a snake eater song and then copyright simon and then um you know like the the trailers like the actual just release trailers they're more of like a a thing to get people who who might not know about the game hyped you know yeah and that's when the game drops to early access so when it's actually available to anyone anyone who just picks up the game and buys it and gets it they'll be on the early access branch by default and they'll just be able to play what they saw in the trailer um and so yeah like the the the uh patch notes ones are more of like like a fan service things that we do for our community um but hopefully they're also still enjoyable to people who are kind of outside of the community and and still a little bit informative as well as well so that people can still get an idea what you know what they're what's coming so this is a tricky balance because like we don't want to we we also want to move on and like not because this video is long as hell and like we didn't anticipate it being this long actually we did a i did a pre-cut of this before we filmed anything recording anything where i just like i just read the lines out and i acted i acted it out sort of made a placeholder cut just to see like how big the video would be and and like it was like half the time uh and then we just just added more like we found more and more [ __ ] that we're like this is funny to add like we gotta do it this way and stuff like that so yeah but uh worth it
