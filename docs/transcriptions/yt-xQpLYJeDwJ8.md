### Transcript

> how does the horizontal small pillar work is it just, like horizontal yes it's like the beams is that all you do they work similar to beams so you you aim and then I think they they, they snap too I don't know what they snap to I don't know if they yeah small pillars not free form but they're like they they snap in the same manner that beams do so like when you're aiming at walls I don't know if they work on walls actually I haven't I've only tried it on the bigger pillars but pretty sure that you can like aim at walls and then drag them out I'm not sure but, don't don't sue me if I'm wrong on this but, that's the way we did it with the pillars we just aim at the pillars and drag them out right I'm pretty sure they zoop but yeah I'm like I'm 70 sure
