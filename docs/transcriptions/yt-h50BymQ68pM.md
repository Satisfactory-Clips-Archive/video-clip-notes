> so yeah with that out of the way, I'm going to move over to the real news which is state of dave state of development and the I got some banger news to tell y'all today the the badger news is that we have no real news, yeah so, I'm gonna re-reiterate this if you this is your first time joining in maybe the new time slot unlocked like potential for new people to join in I don't know but, essentially since the launch of update what five what was the last update five, no robo jc what do you mean robert jays we've never had a robot jace silly, so, what was I talking about yeah so if you have if this is your first time joining in and you haven't heard the news up until now is that we are kind of in a phase of development where we are working on the next iteration of the game and we don't really have anything to share yet we don't have any news or any like timeline that we're aiming for right now because while we're working on the game we're also kind of trying to figure out what we're gonna do with the game, and I guess I can say this a little bit because we are making the thing right now guys is a little bit different compared to how it's been in the past you know when we've been in between updates and we're like trying like okay what's the next step like the thing is we always have you know 1.0 at the horizon and that's been the case since the very start right but I think we've shifted a little bit more towards like actually thinking about what doesn't 1.0 release mean for us and like I said we don't have anything to share really right now but you know we are trying to figure out if you know doing a new update makes sense for us or if we should do smaller updates or if we do you know change it around a little bit and don't do like proper updates anymore we don't know like they might be in update six there might not be an update six maybe we'll do a smaller update I don't know we haven't decided yet that's kind of what we're trying to figure out and that's what we've been trying to figure out for a long time now, so what I'm what I kind of wanted to say with this is like our main emphasis has been that we are looking towards the future we're trying to try and figure out what we're going to do for this year and I know we're already into march, and it's been like three months of us trying to figure out what to do, but this is a this is a tricky making games is tricky, and we want to try and strike a balance between like what makes sense for the game as a whole but also what makes sense for you guys what makes sense for us, etc etc so yeah no real news yet, I just want to keep you guys in the loop as to why we're not you know why we haven't announced anything apart from the many dates that jace have given, on when update says is coming out I wonder if jace has another date that he wants to share with us today maybe no oh okay didn't get a response there but anyways, so yeah that's sort of the situation right now and, you know maybe we'll do a different format in the future who knows we don't for sure for sure so that's what we're trying to figure out so that's why we haven't given any news as of recently now that doesn't mean that we're not like working on the game obviously we are working on the game, and we're also still kind of patching the game, slowly it's been kind of slow on that front because we've had work done on like our build system and whatnot and various other things have come in between but we are patching the game and we released the patch two weeks ago or is it one week ago on experimental, so there's still a bunch of stuff coming on experimental that are like kind of minor fixes that are more like system kind of wide changes that we're doing where we would like to get these out and try them out and see like if they work and if they work then cool then we can base that on like what we're working on, right now and stuff like that so it's also a good period for us to like try that out, and you know we've pushed I can't remember exactly where we pushed in the in the last couple of weeks but we made changes to like how the vehicles work a little bit fix some crash issues with vehicles, fix crash fixes in general, for the game

> and, we're gonna keep doing that, I don't know when the next patch will come out, because we've had some people like be sick at the office and like we haven't been able to work on the stuff and the patching system has been broken a bunch of reasons, and we're coffee scenes so we always delay stuff but hopefully we'll get a patch out sometime maybe next week with more updates and hopefully we can address some of the issues that have been coming up in the previous patch that were released
