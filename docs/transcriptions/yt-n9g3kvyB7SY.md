### Transcript

> and your old programming days did you use sites like stack overflow often yeah yeah absolutely yeah yeah well sometimes yeah yeah it got to a point the the more I programmed the less I used it which I guess makes sense but like especially when I started doing unreal engine stuff it it was never it was it rarely got to the point that I needed like my solution would be on stack overflow like my solution would be in documentation yeah like it was very very rare that I would need stack overflow it's like stack overflow is good when you're like you're you're sitting there and you're like all right I need to implement a I don't want to use recursion but I do want to do with the stack how do you do that again and you like you find it on stack overflow here here's how you do that with a stack like oh cool and then you do that and then but most of the times it's like I want to do this in unreal engine how do you do this like what does the api look like and then you look in the documentation for for unreal engine yeah, or then you might use the, what is it udn or whatever like the yeah like it's kind of like stack overflow but only for unreal development yeah and it's like closed off and you have like other people from epic I think they're opening it up now, with unraveling five, but they have like staff from epic they can answer questions as well so like because most of the times we're asking pretty specific questions about unreal engine yeah that like nobody else has done pretty much, and that's not to say like we're doing something revolutionary that's just like kind of how it is sometimes when you're doing very specific things and we're using the engine in a specific way it wasn't maybe intended as udn is really good for that, and then you google sometimes if it's like how do you ray trace it on real engine sometimes you just forget that too, very basic things so, yeah
