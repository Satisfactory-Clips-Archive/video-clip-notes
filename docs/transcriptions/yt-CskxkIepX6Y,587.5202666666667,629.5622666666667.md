> solutions in that way so yeah if this is if this is confusing don't worry about it i figured this out and if i figured it out you can figure it out i promise you if i can do it you can so another property to pass signals is that on top of reserving a path through a block they also ensure that the exiting block is free okay so this will make sure that your train can take its path and also exit safely as well otherwise you know you might get into weird situations where okay the path was free but there was a train waiting on the exit and you get into a weird deadlock situation or as i like to call them epic train stare down contest
