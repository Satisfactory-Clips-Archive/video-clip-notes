> fixing bugs are doing new stuff it's a combination of both we're doing both fixing we're fixing bugs that we made for update six and also fixing some books old bugs might also introduce some new bugs can't wait we are working on fixing the thing with the train train lines, listen some people, when building train lines they use pass signals and and do a stations in between pass signals apparently that's a huge bummer for us it actually actually breaks a bunch of stuff apparently I don't know we're not certain how it worked before, so we're not we're not certain we can fix it with the new system that we have so we need might need to do a thing where we have to inform the players that like hey you're using path signals in between the the train stations stop but if you're having bugs, with the pass signal like if you're having bugs with trains not reaching train stations stuff like that make sure that they're not encapsulated within path signals right now let's place blockers at the stations and path before and after exactly yeah it goes to her yeah you're playing the game wrong there there is a reason why it's not, like why it's not a good idea to do it I can't I can't recall it because you know every time we have those stupid programming meetings they just keep babbling on and on about like look at the bug I can never remember anything from those meetings I guess you keep talking about like oh try to implement this thing and it didn't oh look at this cool thing we gotta probably use volumetric let me let me okay you know I you know I used to be a programmer right I've done this thing twice now in my gamedev career where I went from a programmer to like another discipline where I'm not programming anymore you'd be surprised how fast you go from like being interested in programming stuff and then just be like in program meetings just like this is boring you'd be surprised okay yeah when you're working satisfaction python love to see that the quiet are you doing this thing too now you gotta do it in the caps
