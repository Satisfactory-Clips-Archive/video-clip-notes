> any secret mechanics we haven't figured out yet oh god no, you should we I hope you found all the things that we've made because we've spent a lot of time on them so we make a mechanic we really hope that you're using it no people people are [ __ ] people have managed to break down like everything that we've done really if anything you guys find like find mechanics we didn't intend like you guys probably have you're ahead of us like the slide jumping I think was not intentional no the slight jumping is intentional at first yeah it was oh was it no no no no no like the speed boost define speed boost you mean the plug where like if you have a high frame rate you just shoot no I mean you just you're foster no that's that's intentional like when you're sliding and jump from the slide that's you get a little boost that's intentional what a weird intentional thing to put in but there's a bunch of other games to do that well you're all weird but, one thing that wasn't intentional was the [ __ ] hyper cannon thing where if you place entrances next to each other you get the boost after boost after boost until you hit the pipe or the hyper tube yeah yeah that was an intentional that's that's something that you guys discovered the canon so then somebody discovered that if you place the new jump pads on a wall and you just run up to them you get like a new place that next to a hyper cannon he shoots you into the cannon oh really that's been fixed suck it oh so see so the thing is nerfed it was nerfed see the thing is like the eat cannon thing like where you stack entrance and intentions that wasn't intentional right but but there's a little bit of trade off there because you need to stack so many entrances and they consume power while like they're just standing around while they're idling so, we felt like it's a pretty okay trade-off like it consumes a lot of power you do get like a significant speed boost that wasn't originally intentional intentional but you know like really tedious as well yeah it's a bit tedious like set it up so like I guess it's it's like an okay trade-off but the the the jump pad just like insta boosting you we were like nah that's that's too cheap can't allow that
