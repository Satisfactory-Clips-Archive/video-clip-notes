> i got this linux this is gonna be the case all right this is the take hey everyone my name is jase i'm a community manager at coffee stain studios and today i'm gonna be showing off some new ui changes that are coming and in doing so i'm actually also gonna be demonstrating the new resource well pressurizer and extractors as well so you're going to see how that whole thing works you'll see their ui and you'll see a whole bunch of other ui changes that are coming to update 4 as well so i thought this is going to be pretty cool so we can just jump straight into it i have a little test level here um you can see this is the um resource well over here i've got some pipes all set up ready to go for how i want to demonstrate things uh you can see a bunch of other buildings over here and in the awesome shops so i'm gonna get to that in a moment the first thing i'll show off though is that we've added a new little quality of life feature to the codex or specifically actually the build menu so like if i go to uh the build menu here i can right click on this and i can go open in codec so this is a nice little thing it opens up that selected thing in the um you can also go to these recipe these parts here you can right click on them and go open in codecs and drill down to whatever it is you need to need to find so it's a really nice quality of life feature there you might have also seen i got a little cheat square here you know what that's for me and not for you okay i'm not a cheater you're a cheater okay so let's go uh we'll leave the uh resource well for last so let's move on over here first of all okay so we're just gonna start off with the shop for for now now we wanted to update it a little bit to make it feel more like an online shop that we're all familiar with uh especially these days in covid uh we do a lot more shopping online so we wanted to make it feel a little bit more like that so we had some ideas for that and here's a mock-up of one of them um so we thought like the whole idea of uh other other pioneers bought but just kind of like suggesting other items could be really good so this is one mock-up um here's another one here some featured items that we could select you know just to prompt people to buy some new things with the uh steam controllers there for reasons unknown to mankind we also had this idea of uh having players be able to like leave reviews and stuff like that which is super fun and i think people would find that really fun but it didn't really make sense with with the game itself uh so we decided not to go down that route um here's some more uh uh little advertisements here to to prompt you to go and uh continue buying more things so we figured that kind of approach would be really interesting here's another design here resembles a little bit more like the build menu that we are more familiar with but ultimately what we arrived at is something that's still quite similar to what we already have but uh with some improvements okay so uh you know i've unlocked sort of everything because on i'm on my my cheat account here uh but you know you can select an item and it comes up with a description as well as recommended items you can favorite your items if you want you can add them to your cart you know we can go to statues we can see what we've got here i could favorite these you know i want to buy these i can add them directly to cart from here you can check your favorite items over here as well see if there's yep you know check out some other statues that we may have so that kind of thing the cart has been updated a little bit as well so you can see uh the changes there and i have a lot of coupons you guys so uh there we are very cool so that's the new uh shop design so the next thing that i'm gonna move on to is uh just sort of production ui changes in general and i'll first demonstrate it here with the smelter you may be asking but jace what are those big cubes over there they're our internal like cheat blocks they just spawn whatever we want uh yeah so they're they're our special little cheats okay so this ui has changed as you can as you can see the main difference here is that essentially we wanted to really separate the input and output a little more so you've got this thing in the middle here what you're creating and then you've got your output over on the other side and we just want it to be really clear what is input and what is output and this makes that much clearer and you know that was never really a huge issue when it was just one one input one output but for example when we have multiple outputs this really starts to separate them to make it much clearer what's what basically it was a little bit cramped and a little bit messy before we felt so that's what we're going along with here the other thing that i want to show is there's actually new ui for each production uh building so you can see look down here look it's got a custom design it's different to the manufacturer see look see this has got a different design right and different designs so a nice little touch each production building now has their own little feel to them as well so that's pretty cool too okay so but you know what i'm going to show one more to you guys that i think it looks really cool i like it but it's it's an unreleased building so i don't know if i'm allowed to do this i don't know if this is gonna make it to the video don't tell anyone i'm gonna show you a new one check it out all right so check it out you guys it's blue it's blue i like it it looks really cool i like it it just looks really cool wonder what it is who knows uh i hope that let me put this in the video because it's really cool okay so we've also updated the power ui as well but also like things like generators have gotten a facelift um so you can see that this is now looking a little bit more in line with what the new production ui design looks like um another thing that we've added which you can't see right now because these are a flat line so i'm just gonna disconnect and reconnect this a little bit okay leave it for a second okay so you can see there's the dips here and uh you know you can hover over each of these it's gonna highlight which piece of data that you're you're looking at you can also show and hide certain things so you can just have one thing on or to your heart's content so a nice little quality of life update there as well for those uh interested in that kind of thing okay so last but not least we are gonna go look at the resource well now so let's check out the resource well first of all we can take a look at the well itself i'll give you guys a nice look this is the well this is nitrogen gas well you guys and then there are these little satellite nodes they're called all right and so we want to we want to get the gas out of these nodes so what we need to do to activate the uh satellite node so that we can extract the nitrogen gas is we need to build the pressurizer on the the main node first so we'll equip the pressurizer we'll plug that on there it needs some power before it actually starts uh pressurizing stuff to come out of these uh satellite nodes so if i'll uh just hook that up real quick all right so it's uh it's gearing up it's doing its thing and the you can see now the satellite nodes on the outside they're all um you know gassing up just so you guys know this is still work in progress like some of these vfx aren't done they might change more might be added there's still a lot of visual polish um still to come so this is just work in progress but you'll see how this works so it's uh slamming away and these nodes are ready to be extracted upon from so let's equip a resource well extractor i'll point this one towards that pipe there we can point this towards those pipes now i'm just placing them all down cool um and now we'll just hook them up

> cool they're hooked up okay so let's take a look at some of the ui here guys this is the resource well pressurizer so you can see that yeah there's some statistics for it whether or not these are the final numbers you guys that may change in the future just take it with a grain of salt i'm just showing it off for now okay but um and you can see that all the extractors are connected as well so if i if i were to delete one of these extractors you can see that it's like four out of five of connected right and then i can just rebuild the extractor connect the pipe and then it says five out of five again so this is sort of what it looks like the ui for the pressurizer now the extractors also have you know they're obviously they've got their own ui and this is kind of what that looks like yep you can see what it's doing now something interesting something worthwhile that i'd like to mention here is you'll notice that i can overclock the pressurizer but i can't overclock the extractors and that's because it kind of works they work together so if you overclock the pressurizer it overclocks all of the extractors now this is going it's trying really hard you guys so now it's uh pumping a lot more nitrogen gas out so uh overclocking these bad boys are really worthwhile one more and the final sort of ui update is gases uh in pipes so you know the the fluids would display fluids here in the ui thing and this is what the gas looks like when there's going to be gas in the pipes so that's a little change there as well for the ui alrighty everyone i hope you enjoyed that i hope that was interesting a nice look at the new ui stuff that's coming in and a little demo of the resource well pressurizer and extractors that whole system and how that works and gases in the pipes looks pretty cool huh looks cool so uh if you enjoyed it i don't know if you like these kind of things but if you did please leave a like comment down below give us the old thanks jace helps a lot we'll bring that back for this video and uh yeah we'll see you next week on tuesday with streams and uh next friday with another video take care everybody hope you have a good weekend bye everybody okay so uh there's also so so um wait
