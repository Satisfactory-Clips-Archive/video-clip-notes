> soon if you could add a feature yourself right now what would that be, being able to, holster equipment is one thing, being able to unselect, when you're mass dismantling being able to unselect individual things if you accidentally select something that's another thing I would like to fix there's a ton of building things that I that I are super annoyed by when I'm playing, especially when I was making the trailer stuff, where like when you're placing stuff you have to like sometimes you have to place things in a very particular order for it to work which is kind of weird like if you place like a splitter if you place a wall and then place like a splitter next to the wall and you remove the wall you can't re you can't add the wall back again for some reason, kind of weird, there are cases where when you're dragging conveyor belts it'd be nice if they snapped to when you're using the snapping tool to have them snap to the input and output, that will be fixed in the future I'm pretty sure because the the like guideline tool and the snapping tool is in the it's a prototype that's reached implementation like the the guideline tool that you're playing with right now is implemented by me and that is a prototype that was not supposed to make it into the game, but it was a prototype that like worked enough I guess so we just decided to put it in the game, but that's a permanent solution, and that's gonna change, at some point I think that whole system is going to be completely rewritten to to function better, prototypes always ends up in production you hate to you hate it when it happens nothing's as permanent as a temporary fix yeah so so those like I think there are a bunch of general like building situations that I would like to improve on, to just make it more streamlined because, I don't I don't think there's there needs to be many changes for the building to just feel so much better but I don't work on the game anymore so it's not up to me
