> like if you're curious about potential uh improvements to the game don't be deterred if you want to try it out just make sure you're back at the safe first uh and also make sure that if you're playing like if you've played on ea up into this open at this point and you start playing on experimental make sure that you don't overwrite your old save if you want to go back because save files work with like you can hold older you can load older saves but you can't load newer saves without uh like you can but it will potentially break stuff and we don't know what it will break we have no idea so we don't really ha uh support loading newer save files but if you load older save files it should work tm um from a scale from one to 2077 how buggy can it be i don't think it will be as buggy as like little like playstation for cyberpunk 2077 okay i don't think it's gonna be that bad um we've we played it a bunch uh there's been a few people um play testing it a bit um so it like i i don't know i'm gonna be honest i don't fully know but it shouldn't be it will it might be the most experimental version we put out uh but it won't be like you know you you'll potentially run into crashes and like wear glitches sometimes but no nothing that will potentially you know affect your save falls too much as you're playing uh you should continue and stop with q a yes let's continue actually uh because it's well we have one more minute actually yeah just copy the file somewhere create a directory on your desktop or whatever and jump them in there
