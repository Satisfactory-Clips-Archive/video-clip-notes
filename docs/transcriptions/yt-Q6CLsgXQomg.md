### Transcript

> what about adding blueprints to the game what about it how what about it blueprints is something that we've always gone back and forth a lot with because, part of like the you know we're quite, inspired by minecraft's view on things where you know you are placing one thing at a time and it's that's part of the game, it makes it so that like when you see this like huge huge factories you know that like so much effort went into it, and and we wanted to be a lot of effort put into making huge builds because it is a huge endeavor and, yeah so so but but we also see the huge benefits of using blueprints as well so it's not like we're never gonna do anything like that this is something that you know we've always been sort of split on internally like some people really want it some people really don't want it so we keep going back and forth maybe we'll reach a compromise, somewhere around the or along the track but right now we don't we don't really have a decision made on what we do there like you'll know at one point whether or not we did it implement or not I guess
