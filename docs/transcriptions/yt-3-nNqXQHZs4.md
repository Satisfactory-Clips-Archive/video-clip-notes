> will there be any improved control support to make it easier I hope so, I think initially we really thought that we would like 100 have control of support for the game but I think the complexity of like the interactions we've added to the game have made it like we don't know if we can do it at this point

> but at the same time I know that there are like steam mappings to the to for control support so I think it's possible still but we don't know for sure because we're still not done with the game we still might make kind of drastic changes to how you interact with things, so you never know really you know maybe as of now it looks very promising to have controlled support full control support to the game, but you know once we reach 1.0 that might be a different case so we don't know right now, and it's also like as to why we haven't done it yet is because the game is develo like during development we would constantly need to maintain control support and it is it is a huge task actually so it's one of those things where like since we're early access and since we're still constantly changing things for the game it would be too much work for us to constantly like have to cater towards controller support all the time if we're adding something it would limit a lot of additions we've done, so but as of now there are pretty good controller mappings, for steam and like you can use them even on epic I think, so those are recommended for now and as for steam deck support and that ties into that question too because one of the one of the requirements to be steam deck verified is that we have full control support which see previous answer so
