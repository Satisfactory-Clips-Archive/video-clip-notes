> yeah, merch we should give an update on march actually okay for merch, weird stuff has happened there, so we haven't finished designs yet so work on the designs is still gonna happen it's a little hard for us I think I mentioned this before but a little hard for us to commit a lot of time to designs because we've also got this thing, it's called a game to make yeah so I was really hoping you'd go with that joke yeah yeah oh I went with the joker yeah so, but we are gonna be assigning time it's just a little tricky but but then the weird part is because of coronavirus the factory closed yeah, so they're delaying essentially or yeah for the duration of this pandemic apparently yeah, yeah cool so we're gonna like try and internally still keep kind of working on the designs and whatnot but the actual supplier may not be able to do much with that for some time and we don't know essentially when things will happen
