### Transcript

> add more body slots, to be able to use bladders bladders and jet pack at the same time we we don't like that solution because it feel you it feels like you get way overpowered but the problem with the way it is right now is i'm gonna i'm gonna let you guys in a little secret here okay from the beginning the game was the equipment was designed around the fact that you had a body slot for each like segment of your body so you had one body slot for your head one for your chest back i think it was back your hands your feet like we had body slots for for your your body parts essentially and the equipment was kind of came from that design but the problem when you have everything but body slug but when you have all the things equipped at the same time we felt like you got a little bit too op and it felt like you're breezing through exploration too much so we didn't like that so we limited the amount of body slots to two but that creates other problems given the fact that our equipment is made for that old way so what we're gonna probably do at some point is we're gonna like look over the equipment system, overall and change it to fit that like to fix that problem i think, so that you won't run into this issue but maybe we won't have like body slots like that maybe we'll do something else with it i'm not quite sure exactly what that would look like i mean none of us are currently because we need to revamp it and look at the different solutions but so yeah
