> had a bit of a game breaking bug i, changed the key bindings off to which i fat fingered the game camera mode and the index at the same time got stuck, in camera mode without any way to exit, so i guess in that case what you could probably do is you could reset your config files just back to default you can do that by finding if you look for where your save files are there you know users your username local whatever factory game saved and then there's like your save files like a folder up from that there'll be a config folder and, what you can do is, there'll be like a config folder windows mode windows 64 i don't know no windows something something whatever you can just delete the config folder or rename the config folder and it will recreate your configs with default settings including your default keybindings but it'll it'll reset all of your default settings, and you could just do that if you wanted and that should restore things so that you can actually work with the game again
