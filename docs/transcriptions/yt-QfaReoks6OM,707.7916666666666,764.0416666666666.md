### Transcript

> Why is there a train track
going through here? I don't know. But it is kind of topical, though,
because we're adding signaling systems and collisions to the trains.
>
> [Train horn]
>
> Ever since we introduced trains
to the game back in the day, we've been wanting to get around to adding a signaling system
and we're finally doing it.
>
> There are two types of train
signals: Block Signals and Path Signals.
>
> Block signals can be placed
along the train tracks to create sections of the track
where only one train can pass at a time. But if you're a train aficionado, then you'll find that you'll need
more complex solutions for your layout. For that, we have Path Signals. Path Signals are used to
reserve a path through a block so you can create safe,
collision-free intersections. So what happens
if you don't make use of the signals? There's also
been an update in how the timetables work.
