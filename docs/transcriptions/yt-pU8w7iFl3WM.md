> is there any plan to make it so that, like smelters and stuff what is like which type of resources being fed into it, because I often forget to to tell it that it's gonna be iron or copper to smelt I don't think there's any plan for that no, I think that's honestly I think that's something that people most people just kind of like adapt to after some time, but you can always go to our website questions.satisfactorygame.com and leave that suggestion there and then people can take that into consideration, I remember we talked about this when we played a long time ago this this stream is highlighted by the way a long time ago me and jace played like a pre-alpha version of the game, like a very very old version of the game and in that version that actually was the case like if if really or yeah if iron ore came into a smelter it would like switch to that recipe, it makes kind of kind of makes sense in like smelters yeah maybe but I think I'm not like 100 sure why we changed it but- I'm pretty sure it's tied to like, onboarding, with the game where like sometimes you would get that behavior on machines and sometimes you wouldn't, yeah yeah because you can't guarantee that behavior on light you can only guarantee that behavior on like the the smelters or lower tier, construction stuff like that on loads here, but I think the heart smells and there's the there's the building everyone's waiting for yo that needs to be on the curious side, and I think like it was just a decision of like it it it's more, the fact that you have to go into the machine and select recipes teaches you about that stuff in the game, and when you're not seeing anything happening that also kind of gives you a like a pointer that like you're supposed to do something and it's kind of weird if that happens sometimes and it sometimes doesn't happen, I think that's the thing that would be very that makes sense that would be very confusing yeah but I can't say for sure but I know for a fact that we we didn't go with that approach for a reason but I wish I knew exactly why but that's just my my hypothesis pretty good reason
