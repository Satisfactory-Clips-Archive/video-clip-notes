> love to do satisfactory do a factor with 500 players in the game that will probably never happen 500 i think that most we've ever seen was 60 something 70. something like 60 something yeah i mean maybe if it's running on a dedicated server it might be okay maybe maybe there's been you know more stability and optimizations that have been done so that number might be able to increase but, i mean yeah it's pretty i think the goal was to get 100 people and i i still don't know if we'd get 100 people in a on a dedicated server maybe because i mean we we technically have some dedicated server support right now like actual servers that do exist that we can test on, so that's kind of the progress of that right now, so it's like you know we could it's a thing that could be tested but there are still issues with it
