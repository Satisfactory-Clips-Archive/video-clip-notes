> right now maybe I'll find out yeah when is the hub bed going to work like the minecraft one I think it's going to work about as good as the toilet does there was a really- I forgot about that reasoning that you put in the qa video actually I think that was pretty good I think maybe you should echo that the the sleeping yeah yeah so so one of the things that people have asked to like skip night by like time traveling like you sleep and then you're bam you're in the morning and one of the main issues with that is just, first of all if if night as in the the lack of light is an issue then the main problem there is that night time is not good, and not that you need to fast like travel ahead in time however the other issue with it is, it undermines the core of the game the entire point of the game is optimizing things and letting things, yeah you want to get things done as quickly as possible and simply sleeping, kind of undermines that quite a bit so yeah but maybe there are things like some people have thought like what if there's a mods that night time is also daytime okay I mean I mean that sounds kind of cool I don't think we would ever put that in the game ourselves personally because I don't know like as a developer where we're saying this is the game we have crafted we'll be like our nighttime sucks so you could just have day night time you can have bright nights now also like instead we should just fix the problem inverted nights inverted nights no- I really feel that the because I played, I played ghost of tsushima fairly recently and the way they render night time is so much better than what we're doing, because like everything is still like it's still nighttime you can tell and everything's dark and all that and moody but like there's something with like the gamma the way they do I don't know exactly what it is but the lighting is just better so everything much like everything is still visible are you saying another game does things better than owls I mean there are plenty of games to do better than ours but here's just one specific case that I thought was interesting but we we've talked about doing that for a long time, improving the nighttime lighting, so it's just a matter of getting your butt
