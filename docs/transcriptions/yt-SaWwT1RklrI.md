> have you considered keeping these videos on demand I'm always in a meeting Tuesdays during this time I must Miss mother would like to watch, the vods are always available for two weeks after the stream is gone up so you can always watch the there's always a video on demand for all our streams and it's been that way since day one so, yeah just check out the VOD and we don't keep them for longer than two weeks like two weeks is the default one and we could put like add them as highlights but there's, the reason why we don't that is because a lot of times and this is actually kind of true with Eclipse as well a lot of time information change with sort of how development goes and that's kind of natural but but for the most part me people tend to cling to like old information so sometimes I see people circulating like old like Clips with old information on them and that's the main reason why we don't keep the streams up for longer than that I just made it did I miss anything well we're about to wrap up this train kind of not wrong actually there's only 10 minutes left
