> so let's talk a little bit about the blender um and how it how like kind of the nitrogen plays into with the blender because that's also something that jay's put up in the video last week the the blender plays an instrumental part in how you use nitrogen to make fuse modular frames which we teased in the advent calendar if you played the fixmas event which ended yesterday um you you are you're gonna need nitrogen in order to make um fuse modular frames essentially in the blender uh because it's made in the blender right yeah exactly uh and we already we showed the cooling system right in the gases yeah we showed it in the gases video yeah yeah yeah yeah so both of those are are made in the blender cool with nitrogen as well awesome have we we didn't show the cooling system before the video last week right i don't think so no it was revealed yeah yeah the guest video yeah exactly so that's another part you guys this there's still more parts coming even that we haven't showed yet um and yeah we we i'm just gonna reiterate also the blender stuff that we released two weeks ago we're at least a teaser for that we talked on a stream we haven't put this in a video anyway uh or put the information out there but uh yeah the blender takes multiple fluid inputs it has um it has a big centrifuge i don't know why that is a point in my notes here um and the few smaller frames were built in it uh and like we teased last week that requires another resource and buildings and that was the gases that were revealed last week and something that we haven't talked about yet and we probably will we'll probably wait a little bit more before we unveil this stuff but the the blender plays a pretty centrifugal part in uh nuclear refinement and stuff like that and how the new nuclear stuff will work um and i don't think we'll talk too much about that today because there's still juicy interesting stuff with that um so we'll kind of tease that leading up to the uh the coming weeks is there anything interesting with the blender you feel like is is cool to bring up mark uh i think the main things that we haven't mentioned yet is that it's unlocked in tier eight okay yeah well so uh to get specific there like the the the resource well stuff isn't locked into your wait did i say tier eight for the blender the blender yeah ah my man tier seven okay so it's it's it's a liquid bauxite refinement the milestone that already exists where you get like uh the aluminium ingots and outlet sheets and stuff like that and we're kind of revising that whole thing so with with tier 8 we're also revising tier 7 of course and the blender is going to come with the bauxite refinement but it won't actually be used for the bauxite refinement but it will be used for a lot of important milestones after you get like your your basic aluminium parts running and you can unlock those further milestones and the reason that we're unlocking it in that that early milestone is because we want players to get to have some some freedom in which milestones they select because most of the important milestones afterwards need the blender to make their parts that they are uh unlocking gotcha to kind of give them a bit more of like an open-ended progression option there where you can actually have more freedom of choice of which parts of the progression you want to continue with you're unlocking it early on so so it kind of becomes like part of the whole like rebalancing thing with with tier seven yeah yeah cool
