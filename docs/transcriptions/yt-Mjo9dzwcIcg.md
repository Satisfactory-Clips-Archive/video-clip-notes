### Transcript

> i ain't asking something that's our answer we'll update five wreck our update for saves we uh so generally that's a we don't really know we haven't really put anything out about that but i think it's probably safe to uh assume that it won't i mean well you kind of have to define wreck like there are people like let's game it out josh josh from let's get it out never heard of it to this day when he played is a content creator uh when he plays the game he's still using the same save file that he used in uh closed alpha that that save file still works so the chance that your save will load in update five for uh your update for save is very high that you'll be able to load your save now whether or not you're building your your machines will be working uh or whatever i don't know how much effort you'd have to go through to fix things i don't know what what levels of effort that would be but i'm i think it's safe to assume that your saves will actually work like you'll be able to load it that's that's our ambition at least since pretty much day one we always wanted to be able to load your save files yeah but like maybe due to balancing changes or whatever you'd need to refactor it essentially in some cases it sucks refactoring some parts like sometimes i know like in the fluid update we did it was like it was kind of okay when we changed the fluid rates and whatnot was like ah you can you can deal with it and the packager and that stuff uh but when we did like bigger ones like pipes it's like it's kind of hard to not do that and also introduce this new cool thing in the game
