> multiplayer update i don't know when that will happen we are constantly working on fixing multiplayer if you're looking specifically for dedicated servers we're still working on that we don't have any ata yet one that will happen, yeah pretty much i talked a little bit about this as well earlier than the stream where you know we are in early access so we can't constantly be working on bug fixes for everything especially not bug fixes that are like not game breaking so to speak, and one one area of the game that kind of constantly falls short because of because of this is, multiplayer because there are there are both like multiplayer bugs that aren't like game breaking but also multiplayer bugs that are super annoying on clients, and stuff like that and the the consensus is that we're also always working on multiplayer but it's such a huge area to fix it's not just like one thing that will fix all of them it's like so many different issues that need to address some of these issues need complete overhauls of systems that take like months to to make essentially so it's a little bit frustrating from our end as well
