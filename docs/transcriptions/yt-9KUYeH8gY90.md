> yeah you mentioned before that they they decided on a shape and then you know try to fit things in that that's sort of the approach i had when i was when i've been building stuff for update five patch notes video, because it's like when you're building things that's supposed to like look good in the background and stuff like that it's it's easy to get the shape up and then trying to fit factors in there and i've noticed that like it's it's significantly easier, in update five because of all the software and stuff wow wow you'll you'll need to get this update five need to get it too bad that you guys don't have it oh it's so good though in front of my belly you guys you just wish you had update five i bet yeah, yeah honestly like it's it's probably a good enough state we could just release it now we'll just wait till next week that's fine we'll just enjoy it ourselves for a little while you know what days why don't we delay a week might as well what's the difference less they've waited this long to wait one more week yeah they can't wake one more that's fine that's fine yeah yeah really cool build nonetheless i love the the roofing situation yup great job
