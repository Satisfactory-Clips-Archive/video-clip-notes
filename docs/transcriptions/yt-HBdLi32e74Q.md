> hello everybody welcome to yet another weekly dev stream I can't believe that we're here again this week this month this year, it is may so it's actually it actually is a new month but, welcome everybody to, yeah the weekly dev stream so let's not yes assad I'm still alone jason is, has one more week off and then maybe next we'll be back I don't know we'll see so how's how's everybody doing in the world in the world I mean in the real world actually, yeah starting on jay's time which is a good good point mesa because I believe that next week we're gonna move back to the old time and I'm going to probably mention that a couple of times in the stream but yeah so we start on 3 p.m cest if you didn't know right now at 3 pm cst next we will probably start an hour later again go back to the old stream schedule, but so yeah good times I need that extra hour to prepare because these streams always come like doing these streams on this hour comes in clutch okay so, yeah it's, looking forward to go back to that but time shows have been kind of tricky and I actually kind of should have moved back actually last week and I forgot to mention that and then I forgot to mention it this week so I'm mentioning it now okay next week we might go back to the old time so if you're here right now next week will be one hour later okay everybody peachy okay good glad we got that cleared up anyway it works better for australia view I know it's it's sad, can I gonna have to stay up late late af for this there's always the the vaude you know but live is live honestly like- I agree with you guys like watching a vod is not as exciting as watching, live even though I'm not interacting with the streamer I still think it's more fun to watch it live I don't know why but that's just how it is anyways I'm just glad that you're here oh geez it's not even me it's someone else you tagged, it's changing the summer time no we've changed the summertime a long time ago but the reason why we switched time zone, the reason why we switched to this time was because jace has been in australia last couple of months and jace is gonna come back from australia next week I think I'm pretty sure, and he'll be back in sweden again so we can actually be in the same time zone is this a live vod did I did I put out a bot to write that message just to make it seem like this is live, we will never know, so yeah welcome everybody to our weekly web stream, the, these last couple of deaf streams have been pretty packed in terms of things to talk about I hope we have time for a proper q a this this week, because there's just been so much information to to convey so I thought today we would take a little bit of a break and it's gonna be a little bit disappointing for some people because we still we're still behind on some information and we put out a teaser for the sparkles we won't talk too much about the spider coast this week but, there will be a video this week about the spire coast again more information clarify some a few things we will talk a little bit about it today too but you know we are planning to go more in depth next week because we will have hannah on and hannah will showcase like talk about everything inspire coach related, so something yes so, so yeah I guess I guess, I don't know where to start there's there's a lot of things I need to talk about today, a couple of things are related to optics a couple of things are related to the game as it is right now I'm thinking it might be good to sort of get that out of the way before we dive into update 6 for a little, because I don't know it feels better to do that way so so yeah the the latest info that I have to give you guys or like the latest happening recently was that a, experimental moved over to ea so there was a big patch friday was it friday I think it was friday opening up the patch notes now I think it was friday, 28th what was that is that friday thursday okay so it was a patch thursday last week, and it broke fix it never I'm so sorry to hear that panna cotta bummer, but yeah that was a huge patch and essentially what it was was moving, the experimental branch over to the early access branch we've been sort of, doing a couple of small patches here and there on the experimental branch mainly changing a little bit how vehicles works fixing some of the issues people have been reporting regarding vehicles but also some fixes for trains, there's a couple of, changes to the dedicated servers I believe but for for the most part the patches the the things that we've done, on experimental have been related to issues people are having with the game so it's mostly a patch fix, there's there's one major thing that I want to address that is related feature-wise and that is we are we have finally implemented a way for people to, unlink their epic online services account so there's now a setting in the main options online in re there's a setting called reset account linking it is now possible to unlink your account, or do that so you can link your epic account if you want to, it opens up a lot of possibilities I probably won't talk too much about this because I think this is I think it's kind of settled for most people like what this feature is and what it does, if you have linked an epic account and you know this doesn't change anything this also only affects people on steam so people on epic this is not a any news, but essentially tldr what this feature does is you know when you started up the game on steam for the first time you got like this prompt that said like hey do you want to link your epic account which isn't something that you needed to do but it's just if you had an epic account and you wanted to be able to like, see your your epic friends in the steam version we gave you that option essentially, and some folks have had like some issues with the game not going online and the only reason the only way to fix that was to reset their account linking because something happened in the back end, with the game so we've up into this point we've been doing that manually and we're gonna stop doing that manually because now you guys have that option to do it so I'm gonna update all the info on the facts and everything but tldr is essentially you are now able to to do that on linking yourself or if you have an applicant account that you haven't linked, you're also given that option now to reset that account linking so you can link an epic account so yeah good times will be had by all so, that's that so the next thing I want to talk about is vehicles on ea I know that a lot of people have been saying that like the the vehicles are bugged now on on on ea, but the thing is they're not bugged they we just kind of changed how dead locking works a little bit with vehicles because here here's the thing right there's there's like two sets of people using vehicles in a in a specific way, and maybe people coming in from like playing update four or even earlier coming in and thinking there's issue with the vehicles, the way they're designed right now is, I think we talked about this before as well but we've introduced dead locking to vehicles so similar to trains, vehicles can get deadlocked now so if there's if you have like vehicle paths where if you have like a roundabout or something like that and there can be a situation where where vehicles might end up like giving away for each other but there's no way to like for them to exit out of that they will deadlock and they will like be in a state where essentially they're waiting for the other vehicle to to take action to resolve the the them stopping, and this is intentional this is because there's a lot of issues where when vehicles collide they because like, unpredicting, what's the word like they can be very unpredictable situations when vehicles constantly collide with each other and stuff like that, and as we when we introduced like ghosting and that stuff in update four we made it very clear that like ghosting is supposed to be a very last, like like last attempt for vehicles to resolve their issues right, so we want there to be a an aspect of the game where you are designing the routes and the routes do have to make sense we don't want you to like cheat around like the system that exists just to make it like simpler for you, and some people like playing it that way and it's very disappointing for them that you can't do that anymore and you know that's fair criticism but we think that it's better overall doing it this way because there's a lot of people getting annoyed by vehicles like flying around the map and stuff like that or people expect vehicles to take a certain amount of time to like deliver, deliverables and they're not meeting those like time frames which means that if they're having like people having like power issues because their vehicles aren't, performant and stuff like that it's really important for us that we make a system where vehicles can be as performant and like as reliable as possible and that's been the goal since the very start making vehicles more reliable, so so that's the main reason why deadlocking is more like muted right it'd be funny if I spent like this amount of time and then now I realize I'm muted, so so that's the main reason why, dead locking is it's it's a like bigger aspect for vehicles now, is because yeah they they cause a lot of issues for people and, we don't really see a way around that except like increasing how deadlock works and we'll probably tweak this a bit more but but this is like the direction we're going with with the vehicles, and if you agree or disagree you know the qa site is always open for you guys but please keep it civil the next thing I want to talk about is and clarify is that if you have a a train station and you're supplying fuel to it, it will calculate like how much fuel is needed for a vehicle to make like a full, route back to the the fuel station, some people believe that the routing is if you have like one fuel station here and you have another way if you have one fuel station here and have another one here a lot of people seem to believe that the fuel is calculated based on like how much time it takes for this vehicle to go from here to here but it's actually calculating the entire route, I believe I should have I should have double checked this but this is this is what they told me so somebody can probably correct me if I'm wrong but this is I think how it's intended to be, this can be confusing if you're not supplying enough fuel for the vehicles then they will stop and wait for the fuel, so important to note that another thing important to note is that some people think that, if if a truck gets stuck on the way and it's fueled for like a certain route right and it gets stuck on something, people think that that will cost extra fuel but that is not the case, if if a truck has calculated that like I'll need this much fuel to go this route, then if, if a truck is automated it will only use that that much fuel regardless of what happens during the route so if the truck falls off a cliff and goes back or like gets stuck on like a pillar and tries to move back and forth and shimmy and stuff like that it won't use any extra fuel, and I've seen some people think that that's the case and if you are exp like make sure that you are supplying, enough fuel to the truck station at all I think it shouldn't even move but if you are experiencing something like where the trucks run out of fuel and it seems like they're supplying enough it might be a bug with the system itself but it's not designed to be like that so please same thing there let us know on the qa set if you're running into that issue specifically and we can and and maybe supply your save file if you can reproduce it you know the more information you give us on this matter the better, yeah the more information you you supply was the better so we can look at it but it's not intended to be like a thing where un substantial like circumstances are not like taking into account with this they should be so if you're if you're running to issue where you have an automated vehicle it's running out of fuel, it should essentially that's the goal at least, so that's the design, and I'm addressing it because, I think one one thing that we've been kind of like bad at communicating when it comes to the vehicles is that we launched, we launched how vehicles worked in update four yeah four wait five wait then when we changed the vehicles it was up four or five I can't remember whatever, we even like going back and forth a little bit about how we implement the vehicles and like going back and forth a little bit with with community as well, given feedback we've gotten on vehicles, four or five we will never know it's one of them five I think we've I think we like did we introduce ghosting and no it was five right whatever this is irrelevant anyways, we introduced the vehicle change in one of the updates and then as we were in experimental we were changing a little bit how they worked and also like went back and forth a little bit with some of the design decisions regarding the vehicles, so people folks that had like started trying out vehicles at the start of experimental, and then people that started using them in early access they got like kind of different, experiences with how the vehicles worked, so that led a little bit to confusion but then also while in between updates, between update five and now we've also made a couple of changes, and I think I think this adds a lot to the confusion as to like what their intended behavior is, because people tune into like you know the announcements for their releases and then they see like us talking about vehicles in a particular way, but then when they look at the game right now a they function a little bit differently so that is that is you know on our part and that that's you know we second our job
>
> [Laughter]
>
> in explaining that stuff we should probably be more clear about that, it might also be that maybe we shouldn't be tweaking, those kind of gameplay features in between updates because it might be confusing for folks, because I mean we are pretty adamant when everything else in the game that we try not to change too much balancing wise and like gameplay elements that when people build in a certain way you know it will change how they built we try to keep like the experimental phase during updates for that time you know so the people that jump into early and experimental they know what they're in for, so so that is a little bit unfortunate we are in early access so you know it is the case that we are updating the game and to a certain degree you know you guys also have to understand that we have to change the game, if we feel like we need to, and sometimes it makes more sense to do these changes you know when they happen because handling updates the way we've done up until now, it's it's tricky so so but I just wanted to kind of clarify those things at least when it comes it comes to vehicle we will probably I'll probably do more clarification on this particular topic when I know when I understand a little bit better because there's also a lot of times where and this is kind of whoops problematic, in general when it comes to feedback, when people have played a long time, and they have like more complex solutions to their setup it's sometimes really hard to communicate like what the, like what is the actual issue that people are trying to communicate to us and you know we when we try to like figure out like what is the problem we don't have like a clear enough vision of like the complex setup that is needed to actually run into the problem sometimes, because like there's no way for us to to be able to play the game to the same extent that you guys are, which which falls back to like if, it's it's really important that the more information we can get from the qa post when you guys are are reporting stuff the better and I know at a time like a broken record here, talking about like how important it is that qa posts are very clear, but it it really is like super super important, because it really is like an aspect of like you guys tell me something and then I go tell that the development team something and then they're like I can't what do you mean and then go back to me I'm like maybe I don't know like and then it goes back and forth so like it's really it's a lot better if if there are qa posts regarding these issues they're as clear as possible they have as much information as possible you know uploading save files and you know giving very clear instructions as like what is the way how to reproduce an issue you know those issues are really easy to, to look into and those are more likely to get solved so so yeah essentially explain the dead things as if they're five years old exactly so yeah so so that's a few things with the patch, that came out last week because anything else I'm check here eos there was an engine update, we were kind of like we were kind of curious if that would break mods I guess some mods were broken due to like changes oh yeah yeah okay well I'll finish this train I thought before I just like so happy I remember this, so so we were kind of like because we did an engine upgrade a small engine upgrade we're kind of worried that the engine upgrade would break mods but it appears that, most mods were okay but and here's here's the butt okay, some folks have reported that there's like random issues with trains and train stations, and we have yet to be able to like reproduce these internally and we believe that the cause of some of these issues are due to mods so this is one of those cases where the game might seem to function like well but there might be mods that are like breaking something and it's like super obvious, so there's there's there's a couple of things that we're looking to train I'm not saying that every train related issue that we just run into, that happened due to the patch are because of mods because there are a few things that we are looking into, but, a lot of a lot of cases that I've seen with the path thing specifically, seems to have been a direct like people that have had mods installed, when they uninstalled every mod and tried it again it worked so, and we don't know which mods are affecting it so it's like it's it's a really tricky thing to to troubleshoot because in our testing we're not running into any issues so it all back again to, please folks if you are reporting these issues with trains, please give us as much detailed information as possible are you using mods how is your train set up even give us your save file so we can try it ourselves, because it sometimes is really confusing to us when like people are like oh like the paths are broken and we're like, are they like they work for us and like you know there's so much we can do when we only have so much time to test things,

> so yes, so that that was the main thing I wanted to bring up here that there there have been a lot of, issues with the game where mods seem to be the culprit and we've been not have been able to identify it but we're still looking it's not like we ignore it just because it's not like as soon as we hear mods are related we're like ah drop it, we are investigating some things but, the majority of folks that I've talked to have had, the main issue has been because of mods, so like if anything make it like a protocol if you're running into issues with the game and you have mont installed to like try out before like reach out to us try and uninstalling mods and see if you're still getting the same issue, it's kind of annoying too because sometimes just saving the game with a mod installed and loading that save file could be enough to to cause issues with the game and I know that the mod creators don't want to like add extra work to us when they create mods so it like the more you guys can help out and like figure out what's the problem better because sometimes there's been cases where if you use a mod save the game uninstall the mod load the game there's still an issue but if you were to play the game vanilla, the same way, it would wouldn't be an issue so like sometimes that's happened too, and those take like so much so so much time to like figure out what the why that is and then it ends up being just like we can't do anything about that, and we have to reach out to the mod creators, hoo boy so yeah that's that's that's, that's the patch, that we launched last week, again the qa side if you're having any issues please report on the qa site there's been, I've seen a lot of people talk about different things but when we search on the qa site we don't see any posts about it so like that gives us some information that there's some issue but like it's really hard for us to investigate it unless there's an actual post on the keyword site, so I urge you all to check out the keyword site if you haven't already okay, cool let's see oh yeah I guess one more thing to mention too this isn't really interesting maybe to to you guys but it's interesting to us I guess but up until now we haven't been able to like collect, crash reports on the dedicated servers, you know when you crash the game in singapore which happens all the time right you get this like crash reporter, and when you click like yes I want to send a crash like that we get that automatically that's not been possible to do on dedicated service until this patch, I believe there's like a setting if you want to allow if you want to allow like you still won't the game still won't send any information out unless you approve of sending that data you know it's the same thing with the gameplay derivatives and stuff like that, so so there's a setting somewhere on the database or I believe you can opt out if you don't want to send the crash reports but for the most part these are anonymized so I don't think there actually is like any any private like personal information regardless, but just so you guys know like, that that option is also in there maybe that's fun information or not I don't know which is really good for us, because dedicated servers can crash because of dedicated server related reasons not because of the game, and it's been really it's been a struggle to like kind of figure out those crashes because we don't get any crash reports, on dedicated servers we've had to like manually get those crash reports so, good times will be had by all, so yes that's that's the patch oh boy that took longer to talk about than I thought
