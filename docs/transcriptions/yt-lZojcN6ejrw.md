>, when the multiplayer will get some love my son bought it would play with it so buggy yeah multiplayer is always getting updates, every single update we haven't updated the game in a long time though because we're focusing on update five so we won't have like any updates until update five is out but we pretty much like do an update on multiplayer like we do optimization and bug fixes multiplayer pretty much every, patch that we put out so that's something that's going on all the time there's never gonna be like a patch that's gonna have like a like a lot of multiplayer fixes, accumulatively except for maybe the first one with update five because that that one is you know all the the multiplayer bug fixes leading up to update five but we're probably gonna introduce some new bug fixes for multiplayer and update five because that's the way it is early access is, it'd be like you do in early access you know, but we're like fixing multiplayer says a marathon it's not a sprint so that's something that just are gonna roll out as they come so hopefully that answers your question
