> with the shooter aspect of the saturday become a stronger you said there will be bosses so there will be they won't be I actually don't know if it's if it is a boss or not but we have an intention to add like the big crab enemy but I don't think that would be a boss encounter but it will certainly be a bigger enemy than like anything else in the game but as for like if the shooter mechanic will improve in the game, we have we have intention of improving the like some of those aspects but I don't know like how far we'll go with it, like I don't think we'll add more guns or anything like that but we might do like tweaks to the guns or something yeah or maybe we'll have more I don't know we'll see I don't know what's been decided fully on that topic but it I think it is an aspect that is lacking, and I think it's one of those aspects that we kind of want to look into a little bit let's see if we can improve it
