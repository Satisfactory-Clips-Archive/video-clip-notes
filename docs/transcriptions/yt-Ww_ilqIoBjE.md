> a water reflection is coming in with the update so the water reflections are part of the shader for the the water, and that is coming in terms in in the sense that like once we're replacing the water volumes that are using that shader, we already are used it's the same shader that we're using in update three, sorry update five they're all blending together, in the northern forest the way the reason why I know why you're asking this by my total is because the reason why it's so extra like, glossy or reflective is because I'm closer to the surface the closer you are to the surface the more reflective they come become, but it is the same water shader I mean it it might have been tweaked a little bit between now and then, but essentially we need to replace those water water, volumes around the map and the same goes for the the the streams and stuff like that, and and it's still gonna be the case where sometimes you can even see like where the new stream and where the old stream starts, some of the streams in update six will have the new water shader, and some of them will have the old one so it's just a matter of like us getting around and replacing all the the the water volumes essentially any water physics with the newer waterfalls so the the new wa yes that will come I'm not sure if we actually had time to replace them for update six it might come during update six we originally anticipated to have it for update five actually but it's getting dragged behind a little bit but it has to do with people being busy with but we are intending to replace like all the waterfalls that you have in the game right now they're all, placeholder and they're gonna be replaced by the new water system which have like a little bit of fluid physics, with them so like if you stand in them you're gonna get pushed the same goes for enemies, there's a video about this, actually maybe you should look at that video satisfactory it's the one with ben which is google satisfactor ben will I find that image well it might be this one actually isn't this one yes cool let's let's actually show this off here's a this is amazing, still I got here as well with jace picking his nose very nice, so so this is what the new the new water will look like, the new waterfalls they will have more of like a like a physical look rather than just being the texture right caught in 4k exactly, and they will push off like enemies and the same goes for the streams and, yeah like th this is this is what the final, water volume will look like essentially and we just haven't gone around to replacing the in-world water volumes with this, because there's a couple of, there's still a bit of work left for them to be able to be adapted to like how the map is made and stuff like that I'm not entirely sure on the details here but, we are they are coming along here's the same water volume that we have seen it's a bit more reflective, and I think I think the only place that have this water volume right now is the lake up atop the update three, sorry update five, northern forest section because northern fort was part of the the rework so it is essentially this, system, that's gonna show up in the game eventually so yes it's beautiful it is really good looking it it that's why I love doing those shots with the like low pan, I did it in which which that was satisfactory update, what video was that for they all they all blend together all the coffee stain videos look the same that's not racist video was that that was cautious how long

> oh was this one sorry going down memory lane so it's the same, water, system here got the reflective same same deal here the closer I get to the surface the more reflective it becomes so it makes it look better, I guess the difference here is that the water here has the waves going for it I don't think they do in the swamp so that might also be why it looks different, so yeah anyways I've been talking about our water now for too long very wet is is water wet though is it somebody somebody actually just gave me a explanation as to why water's wet wet and it was when I heard it it was so like obvious like of course it is duh I can't remember it I can't remember the reasoning just trust me guys can we rewrite the water no it's it's baked into the level
