> I'm not changing asking for a change but why beacons to craft bullets yes no what why beacons oh yeah I saw a thread on on the reddit I think about this I don't know it's like you you get like eight bullets out of one beacon or something like that so it's like segmented or something you just like cut up this yeah I don't know what's up with that actually it could make sense because if it's the railgun thing it's just they're just like wooden, wooden metal yeah but it's not the right it's the actual gun oh like the rifle the clip maybe it's like the I don't know yeah why why does like concrete like why do we get concrete out of, limestone isn't that the bigger question here yo illuminati get on this why can't we flush the toilet that's a bigger one that's actually upsetting yeah yeah it keeps me awake at night I should riot right now
