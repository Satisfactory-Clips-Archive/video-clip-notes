### Transcript

> one thing that we also talked about is that we're trying to kind of like look at build mode again and like try and improve sort of the the like the base feel of when you're building in the game a little bit sort of, we look at the like ux aspect of that like the user experience of of building and we're trying to figure out like good ways to improve on that, and the sort of instigator on this is when we released update 4 we fixed a bug unintentionally we're so good that we like fix bugs without realizing we fixed the bug with, the chickry which is a thing that some foundations in the game didn't have collision and sort of the thing that was nice about that for people in the community was that that made it possible to like sort of build in a certain way that wasn't possible before and we're not talking about clipping specifically i'm talking about like sort of people using sort of the the cheat crate the the collision-less foundations to sort of create scaffoldings like temporary scaffoldings to be able to like like if you're building around a corner and it's very tight collision then it's it's it's like impossible to unless you like really think ahead to play some of the the foundations and some of the like conveyor belts and stuff like that so the chicken was really useful in that sense that you could, use that to do creative builds and stuff like that and when we fixed that we felt like it was such a bummer that people felt less it felt like a not an improvement and we really want to fix that bug but we also don't want to have people in the community feel that you're limited in the sense that you how you can build and stuff like that so we're looking into that for update five and that's something that we announced a long time ago
