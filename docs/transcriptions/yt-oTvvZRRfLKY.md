> any workarounds for the d3t fault and unreal engine, so the workarounds so those that issue is mostly because of hardware, there's we haven't found any way to reproduce that case, unless you have like, drivers that are incorrectly installed or not up to date, there's also you can get that if you are on a laptop and you're not using you haven't disabled like power save and stuff like that and there's also you can also get that crash if you have more than one graphics card and you haven't set your graphics card to be the default one that you want to use and that can happen this is also like a very interesting case where like sometimes the blade runners can cause that crash we haven't been able to like reproduce it at all but multiple people are saying like oh when as soon as i equipped the blade runners i get that crash which doesn't make any sense, but i guess maybe that's the thing too so don't use the blade runners until we figure that out, so those are the things i know at the top of my head but like not on the time temps when people talk to me about that d3d, crash it's because of hardware and like i i kid you not not on 10 10 or like when i talk to people they like oh having this issue and i'm getting this crash and i'm like okay most people tell me it's hardware related and they're like it can't be hardware related and then like maybe a month later they come back like oh yeah, one of my rams died or like my hard drive crashed like there's always like something actually wrong with a computer so if you're getting that crash, back up your computer, because you can go very bad if if that's the case i'm not saying that's the case here, it's just like the people when i've talked to people a lot of people come back later and tell me that like their computer broke when they started getting that crash, if they if their computer broke because of our game i don't know i hope not, but, usually it's like a sign that like something's not great, so yeah that's a psa right there
