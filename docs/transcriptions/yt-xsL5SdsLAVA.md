> fast food in the u.s in general is garbage it is it is it is not great i yeah my last time i went to the us we had fast food quite a few times and, my body was just not having it like whoo boy, really rough really rough but some places are pretty good like i've had wendy's and that was okay but that was before i was vegetarian but when this was okay and i've had, i've had like denny's and i remember having pancakes at denny's and they were okay but i was kind of young and dennis is like one of those places where people will absolutely trash talk denny's, so maybe they're just like way worse now than they used to be when is it okay that's that's how i felt at least dennis are amazing wow i've never heard anyone say that ever in my entire life
