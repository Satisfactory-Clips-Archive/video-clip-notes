> that'll do, sort of spamming but I know it's big on the qa site what's the thoughts of hanging conveyor mounts my thoughts are that sounds cool, but I don't know what the status of that is within the company in terms of if they've decided yeah it's not a technical issue because, there was a bug where that happened I guess or maybe not, but one of the others broke the bug because like when we implemented the mountable conveyor mounts we can hang them on bottom of foundations, you can apparently do that with a lot of like almost any buildable now, as proven with the jump pads you can play them on walls and ceilings so I don't think it's technically impossible but it's probably like we may need to make a new model maybe or I don't know specifically but check it on the quick qa site, make sure that it's uploaded if you guys really want that, and then yeah our our people will get back to your people how people get back to your people exactly
