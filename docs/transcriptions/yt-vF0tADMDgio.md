> when you guys get ready for a build do you hold off on new development and work together to finish current pull requests, sort of we have, we work in in different it's referred to as branches but like we work in on different things on this game and the problem is like we can't it's it's kind of hard to like merge things together so like if we work on one thing here and another group of people work on something here there's always a like if we want to combine the two it's a lot of work like managing that so whenever we make a public build we do it on like a release branch and then if we need to fix something we need to go back to the release branch because we can't really like move it into the release branch if we fix something and then we have to move that fix over to the development branch it's it's really tricky, but when we are doing like these major releases, we do come together sort of on that release branch and then like work together on fixing the things that we need to do and that disrupts sort of developments on maybe some other things we're working on and at the same time like that's sort of why we the way we're doing it now where we we can't fix bugs all the time we'd rather do it when like we release something and then we like sit down and fix the bugs because of that like it it messes up the workflow if we constantly go back and forth and fixing bugs and and then we have to move the fix over to a new branch and blah blah so, so kinda kinda yeah amazing, programming comments here by the way all of jace's commit message is just vominos
