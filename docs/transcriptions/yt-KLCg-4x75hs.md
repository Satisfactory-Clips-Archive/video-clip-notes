> let's see I think I think, we managed to capture all the fixed related stuff at least that's good, that's good it's good but yeah just tldr like fixmas will work essentially like it did last year so like if you want to know more about fixmas just look up like on the wiki, I believe there are also a couple of like fictional guides here and there on the steam forums on reddit, to learn more about that stuff so if you have any questions just ask in the community and I'm sure like people will will help you out too if you're new you want to learn more yes because it is it is like it is one of those rare things where like I don't think we will put everything in the patch notes even like what is in fixmas it's it's more like we enjoy yeah we enjoy people figuring things out and finding things on your own instead of us telling you what's in the build and I think it's going to be pretty much the same thing this year
