> so okay wait so we sort of touched this earlier, but it was about like we sort of talked about like how how do you check your translations and so there were those ids that you guys can use in game check it up with crowdin the tool and you can see what text maps where right but but then like how long do you have to wait to see if your translation works in the game, i guess i can direct this to say megalian, usually you just wait until the game gets updated and then you just try it and see if it first of all fits in the game because a good example is german again you can't really tell if it's going to fit inside of crowding because it's hard to tell the dimensions of the certain strings and once you see that they don't fit in game you'd have to return to crowden and maybe change it up or contact alex and ask him about maybe extending the ui and if that doesn't work then you really just have to rework it again right and then you have to wait another how long for an update who knows how long until you guys update the game when we feel like it let me just jump in here but that's that's something that jace wanted when i came here, to the coffee stain and even before that when we talked about this, we were asking, about how quickly we can update the game and jay said this is a pain really because, we used to update localization not that often it used to wait for bigger patches and maybe hotfixes and something like that so we people waited like a month sometimes yeah and that was really awful and we understood that so that was one of my focuses from the start you kind of find a way to patch more often and now we have this so i can actually patch it like every week or something i'm not doing it because between big updates there's not that much progress but when we have the update on experimental, i think guys you remember this, magellan roger and everybody in translation community team, we updated i don't know a couple times a week maybe three times a week so many times over yeah so that was done specifically to help you quickly see your translations in the game and i'm thinking about how to implement the, thing that roger talked about that you could export stuff from crowding yourself and put it in some folder in the game installation and that the game picked it up so that you could actually test your translations yourself without waiting for us to do this i think unreal can do this without too much effort from us but we didn't have the time with the team at coffstein studios to just dive into it and try to implement this but i think we can't do this i will not promise you when but i think we will fingers crossed that's huge yeah that would be very nice yeah and yeah and since i'm working for coffee stain publishing my idea is to kind of make this a module thing so that we could use it in other games as well when we develop our future games and stuff so that's the idea oh exciting
