### Transcript

> power um multiple body slots when yes maybe maybe uh yeah we've talked about a lot of different solutions and you've talked about this a bunch on here as well generally we do want to support it it's just uh the problem before for me has always been that we don't have enough different types of equipments which kind of makes a lot of challenges that we can apply with exploration super redundant because we don't have the tools to then challenge the player anymore right when they have a jet pack and a gas mask and the blade runners but i don't think the general idea of having those things on at the same time is an issue so i think we want to support it if that is from multiple body slots or maybe combining equipment together at certain points in the game so we can maybe control it a bit better that way as well i don't really know yet we have been talking about it a lot there's a lot of different ways on how to do this but it kind of comes down for me at least to the idea that we need more types of equipments so that you can actually have different things in your head slot if you could only have the gas mask there it would be a bit meh so i want more different types of equipments to really make this a proper thing and then of course more things that actually require you to have those equipments and want to use them and swap around sometimes not constantly run around with the same stuff on your body gotcha one other thing that you pointed out before as well that was pretty interesting i haven't thought about it was that the world is kind of designed around the fact that you have one body slot that you use at the same time so like when you're in gas you won't need the jump uh the jet pack to be able to like get around the the world puzzles that we have in those locations and i guess the world does will need some redesign if we're gonna have more than one body slot for those cases yeah that's a big problem like you said like you could have a jump also that has gas on it specifically to stop you from using the jet jetpack to get onto it or make you think in a more creative way of how you can either build your way up or get to get there with the jetpack from like a different point but that would kind of be ruined of course if you can have them both at the same time than the whole gym person just gets completely destroyed right
