> are there any updates to dedicated server coming soon we have been planning to do a docker, image I think it's called a docker release for the dedicated server sometime soon, some updates take stuff has come in between for for people working on the dedicated service part but, feature wise for dedicated service you know dedicated servers are still experimental we are working on them in parallel with everything else and, the one thing that's kind of been like delaying dedicated to work a little bit is our build server because we've made our own custom build server it's a lot of work to maintaining that that's why we've been hired looking for hires for hiring, people that have experience with, game engine build server specifically, so hopefully we can like remove that workload from people working on dedicated servers, but there will be more things coming to data servers there's a couple of features I think we want, etc etc so it's not done but the dedicated server like feature set is is running its own like little track it's not running on its own track so it's not affected by update six or anything like that so don't expect like things to pop up with update six you know these features will come by their own sort of they might be bundled with some of the update six releases because it's easier to manage it that way but you know technically they work separately
