> another thing that i have to point out as well is when you're updating the game make if you're running into any issues before you like jump to our qa site which we have a keyway site by the way if you didn't know this is where you're supposed to go and send us your your issues and whatnot uh questions satisfactory game.com um is verify your game files because we've been noticing specifically on steam shame on you valve i don't know if it's valve or maybe it's us i don't know but uh apparently this the when the steam version updates it like misses some parts of the download or something like that which makes the game like kind of corrupt but it can still run and stuff uh so a lot of people have like solved a lot of their issues by just verifying the game files so always do that if you're running into any issues to just make sure that it's not because of the the patching system or whatnot yay there's a link in the youtube chat cool um there you go cool cool all right
