> soon soon very soon we're gonna have something else hopefully hopefully exciting news, to you guys I mean we think it's exciting we will see if you guys think that yeah that's exciting so yeah you told me yes so yeah this stream we're basically this is the announcement of the announcement of news of an announcement okay this is the countdown to the countdown this is the countdown to the countdown to the announcement okay yeah so like I know everyone's like haha announcement of announcement but you know I figure you all would appreciate to hear that like we're going to have something for you soon you know like maybe next week maybe if everything goes well yes, not on the stream but like next week, and you know hopefully y'all are happy to hear that okay so because we have been sort of plotting back and forth like what we should do next in terms of like but what do we do next like in terms of like because we have had an up in the air like maybe we don't do whatever you guys will know more about it next week like yeah there's no point of us just but like talking around yeah but like one one thing one thing that I sort of want to make clear is like even though like we haven't been giving you guys news and like we've been saying like we're we're figuring out our planning and figuring out what we want to do next like I also one thing I just want to make clear is that like over the past few months it's not as if we've had no idea what we wanted to do and that no one's been doing anything like we have been working on things that we know we are gonna be working on and that we know are gonna be coming it's but it's just more of a matter of like is that thing coming in the next update or not and, and like what else is gonna be coming in the next update but there were you know but even though we didn't know everything that was going to be coming we did know like a bunch of stuff that's going to be coming so like we have been working on things that needed to be worked on so I just want to make it clear that like we haven't been doing nothing like we've actually had quite quite good direction but it's it's more about like how do we how do we like package what this update's going to be like what's going to come into this update and then like what can we tell you about that's what we needed to figure out and we're getting much closer to that now so and also if there even was gonna be an update that was also something we were also trying to figure out like if it makes sense to keep doing it that way yeah like we're literally having all options on the table even if it meant not having an update anytime soon you know we're just trying to figure out what is good for balancing what's good for everyone you know yes, because you know if we only give you guys what you want like the the game might the game and the development might suffer for that so we have to like weigh the development into account way what we wanted to account weigh what you guys want into account, and and then try to find a good way forward from there and that's you know what we've been doing all along but, we're at a different stage of development now where the, plan of attack has to change a little, and we need to be sure that we can adapt to that that we don't just stick to a formula that we know and love that has worked in the past make sure that we use formulas that work well for us now everything has to sort of focus because that's the main crux with for us developing the game is that we always put the game first kind of and it's easy to say that because like oh of course you want to make money blah blah blah but like for us it's really important that the game comes first and that we can make a great game because we think it trickles down from that like we think it's important that if we make a really good game then things will like trickle down from that, and that's sort of how we have to approach development for that game as well so that it fits so yes so, yeah exciting exciting times to come,
