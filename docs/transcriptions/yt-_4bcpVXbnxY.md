> dual output MK3 Miner please easy fix I mean in a way it is an easy fix but it's it's not a matter of whether the fix is easier well it is a matter of how difficult a fix can be because if something's too difficult then it won't want to do it but, it's also whether we want that so yeah and as you might have like noticed like a lot of people a lot of y'all request things, for us and there are many times that we we Implement those things but they don't always match the way that anyone had requested it before because, and so like blueprints is sort of one example of that where, when we add a when we add a solution we try and we try and like solve many problems at once with one specific thing or like you know what I mean so if we just added a second output to MK3 minor, it's it's not like it will solve that immediate issue but like what other sort of precedent does it do is there is there a better way that might be more interesting that we can, solve the same issue, where we don't have to have two outputs or maybe two outputs is like interesting and maybe we do want that yeah I don't know it's it's up to Mark it's up to Mark and and the other folks I guess
