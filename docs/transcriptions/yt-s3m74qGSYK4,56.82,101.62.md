> hey everyone my name is Jason the community manager here at coffee stain studios and today I'm just gonna make a video it's gonna be like a rapid-fire update video of some of the things that's gonna come in the future but before I talk about future stuff I want to talk about some past stuff and that is a say yesterday I did a live stream on our Twitch you can follow us on Twitch which is twitch.tv slash coffee stain studios Deb's put a link in the description below and I streamed me editing the next develop a highlight video which is focused on Hana a level designer so that was me just doing some video editing but we've done a couple other streams we want to do more but we haven't done many but we've also done a live stream with snit doing some programming and hannah herself doing some level design so if that's interesting to you consider following us there and we're gonna try and do more of that in the future I think we have another programming stream coming up soon that is the plan another thing that's happened in the past was that lusts week like I remember when I released that video but the last video I asked you should we prioritize dedicated servers or mod support for update 3 we could probably not get both in and we can hopefully get one in so which one should we focus our attention on and we had a poll in YouTube video and people were talking about it on reddit twitter facebook and discord and it really seems as though people want dedicated servers so we're gonna be focusing on that we love the idea of doing that too so that's that's great we're gonna do that have you said that though a lot of people turned up to vote for mod support so that's also really cool so it's great to hear that there's a lot of people who want montt support and when we do make mud support it's it's gonna make a lot of people happy so so we're looking forward to that we're gonna have it just a little later let's talk about the future stuff so in the next one to two weeks approximately we want to do a patch so the first thing I'm going to talk about is the train fixes a lot of people have been asking about fixes for the trains and when I announce that I'm doing editing a video for example people I will fix the trains first I don't do programming anymore so I caught but we have been fixing the trains the delay comes from a series of unfortunate events honestly with the guy who normally does it go sick and then we had to update the engine and all this kind of stuff but we fixed the trains now I don't know to fix everything but I think we have fixed the most requested bug which is the like the ghost trains the carriages like going off and doing their own thing so I believe that one's fixed and is gonna be in the patch the next thing I want to talk about is mast dismantle so we're gonna have a new feature which is mass dismantle so you can clear out your factory much much quick oh my god much quicker and that is actually a feature that Snoke was making on the developer livestream so we'll hopefully have mass dismantle in it's actually already merged into the code and stuff so it should be should be in there the next thing is again it's another snits feature and that is cloud save so that's gonna be really cool as well that's actually also been merchants to the code and and is currently being tested but the thing with the cloud saves is we have to be very very careful with them and test them rigorously because we don't want you losing your saves or your progress having said that we screw up all the time back up your sails cuz I predict this 90% chance of us screwing up I picked and I give us a chance snoot screwed up so yeah back up your saves to when that comes out and we'll keep you posted on whether or not cloud saves will be rolled out or not if we're not confident in it so that's all the things that I want to talk about today we're me and snow are actually gonna be going on the top-secret adventure today for you guys and so I have to be quick with this video because we're running late already so I'll catch you guys next time maybe like and share and all that stuff if you want or don't bite
