### Transcript

> so what's coming in update seven you
> might ask well the main thing is
> blueprints I mean it's like it's
> blueprints uh blueprints so I'm gonna
> give you all the real story here okay so
> we we knew that we were going to make a
> update this year uh we weren't certain
> what would be in it and we were we
> wanted to do blueprints uh because it's
> good to get that out there because we
> kind of want feedback in like testing
> and get that out as soon as possible
> um because that sort of goes into like
> the whole thing where we're working
> towards 1.0
> um so but we weren't sure we're gonna
> make it so that's why we sort of like
> waited on announcing blueprints uh it's
> also like I guess it was a little fun to
> for us as well to do that it's good I
> mean it's also you know good to keep
> some things kind of hidden then we can
> announce that and cause a big bang I
> mean I hope you guys understand from
> like a a fun slash hype marketing
> perspective that that can be beneficial
> too so
> um but it really like really is like uh
> close like it really came yeah like I
> wasn't so some of you may know like I
> want to break for it before I want to
> break I had no idea that we were
> actually not doing blueprints I came
> back and I was like oh cool that's what
> we're doing let's go then right so uh
> it's a very a late decision too because
> we didn't start working on it until like
> very end of update six uh or or
> something like that because we also
> weren't sure we wanted to do it
> um yeah but it was like on the list of
> like when we were looking in towards 1.0
> it's like if we're gonna do blueprints
> this is this is it like now or never
> essentially
> um so that's why it went down the way it
> did
> um so yeah literally like the week
> before
> we posted we were like maybe blueprints
> don't make it in and like but we're
> about to announce it it was like ah they
> uh we'll we'll see what happens
> um
> so yeah good times but they they it's
> there
> um but as you know this is on
> experimental and it is experimental uh
> especially the multiplayer aspect of
> blueprints uh is still a bit work in
> progress uh so you know you play
> experimental at your own risk here we do
> want people to play it so we can get
> feedback but you know there's a chance
> that there's going to be some bugs maybe
> crashes who knows
> um but if you do come across any issues
> with update seven please go to our QA
> site questions.satisfactorygame.com and
> let us know uh about the bugs that you
> come across share screenshots whatever
> uh and then our team can look at that
> stuff and fix what they can fix yes so
> we can stabilize it as quickly as
> possible and then put it out on the
> Early Access Branch so that everyone has
> access to it
> um we can answer a couple of quick
> questions here so somebody asked like
> what tier is blueprints unlocked and
> we're gonna talk we're gonna dive into
> this at like once the update is out
> we're gonna have Mark and we're gonna
> have Dylan who worked on the blueprints
> uh to talk about about like the decision
> making behind it and how it works and
> all that stuff but blueprints will not
> be unlocked in tier four I believe uh so
> it's a mid game it's a mid game like
> thing that you get
> um and I already forgot the Mark told me
> but I already forgot the like
> how much it costs uh it's uh eight
> dollars a month eight dollars a month
> hahaha
> they already got me
> uh endless supply of holy
> it's paid to win dude yeah
> uh yeah so uh get a little check mark
> next to them
> oh anyways all right we got 40 seconds
> yes
> um 30 seconds okay but we forgot we
> forgot how much it actually costing
> games so yeah well Mark is going to be
> here and like I think so we're gonna
> talk about that stuff
> so get get ready mark because you're up
> uh and maybe Dylan as well
> um but yeah but first but first we're
> gonna we're gonna start uploading Bill
> I'm gonna we'll buy a web page here so I
> don't up uh let's see look yeah
> you're looking cool uh it's like this
> one and then
> all right
> you all ready the delete button is right
> next to the launch button here we go one
> oh wait it's not working
> I don't know
> but come in here yeah
> we didn't really think of a way to get
> out of it we should set this up we don't
> know how to get out
> get out we also didn't have any uh we
> didn't have like a video to play or
> anything yeah no so yeah so so this is
> yeah the left of a Halloween stuff
> get out of here all right uh the update
> is out hopefully do you need a hammer
> though
> [Laughter]
> wow great a comedian over here
> foreign
> huh huh did they miss the hand joke yeah
> they did no
> I pushed the wrong button oh
> God
> wait did you hear the hand joke
> oh we heard the oh we got the
> hand wait when did I cut out
> or maybe I accidentally pushed it like
> just a second or whatever oh only mute
> it for 10 seconds okay well they got it
> they got it okay cool cool I was certain
> I pressed the studio live yeah so we
> should be good we're professionals here
> we don't never mess up good one yes
> um but yeah maybe so can somebody
> confirm that the game is it out yeah I
> can't check it because I have the
> staging build open
> um no update well I guess the game got
> deleted guys maybe I should check the
> maybe someone wrote to me like just a
> second like stall stall the truth let's
> see here
> uh update seven will be coming out on
> 22nd of November no
> no
> wait a second wait
> experimental push back push back to okay
> why didn't anyone tell us earlier yeah
> what the we set up the stream and
> everything
> how annoying
> what the Mundi got it
> wait it's shipped only to demerne thanks
> for the community highlight yeah so it
> should be out yeah should be out so uh
> make sure to if you're not seeing the
> update happening on steam or epic uh
> restart the clients like the steam epic
> uh application yeah yeah yeah and it
> should pop up and it'll get updates and
> uh good times will be had by all
> yes yes I saw one person say well bye
> because it's here leave then I mean why
> did you come here at all
> what were you hoping for
> all right uh all right you got other
> people coming in oh wait maybe it's more
> okay tell me first
> check the notepad
> I already forgot the schedule
> oh right I haven't I didn't decide it
> um and it says uh uh QA guy uh Lizzy was
> saying that the build's alive now so we
> should be we should be sweet
> uh
> uh should we do I'm a bit conflicted
> well because either we have both Mark
> and Dylan on at the same time I think
> you should have both of them on yeah
> okay let's do that and then I'll even go
> get my hella fresh are you are you
> hearing me uh Dylan and Mark get your
> butt over here
> build us on fire yeah true it should be
> fine
> because like the thing is like it takes
> so long it's like even if there was
> something we discovered like that
> would still not like it's still too long
> yeah yeah yeah okay it is a pretty we
> talked about this a couple of times on
> stream but it's it's a quite complex
> like build system we have for for uh
> like when we're working on the source
> code and all that stuff and then when we
> need to push it on like the different
> builds like the different uh platforms I
> mean like on Steam and epic and stuff
> like that this it's very complex like
> build system that handles like how
> is built and uh hey good looking all
> right
> um
> so um
> it takes like 20 minutes or something
> like that to to get it ready
> cool yeah uh all right yeah so we're
> gonna have a couple people who join talk
> about blueprints uh there's gonna be too
> many people on the couch so one of us
> have to leave
> uh or both of us here we go you guys can
> just do the stream around here this is
> paper rock let's see who goes okay Rock
> Paper Scissors Shoot
> Rock Paper Scissors Shoot oh I won so I
> get the time off for everybody
> dude I was so curious how are you gonna
> handle that
> foreign
> oh that's so good holy
>  genius play Hey Pokemon welcome
> in Let's see we gotta we gotta make sure
> we all fit in here
> tight squeeze can I give you but no that
> doesn't work
> all right I might need to just actually
> we're gonna do this
> we'll be right back after these men
> foreign
> thank you
> foreign
> we're back look at us back to the future
> so I'm joined by Mark our game director
> and I'm enjoyed by Dylan
> yeah
> and I'm gonna oh I forgot to update
> these uh but so I think I think maybe
> not everyone is has been to the stream
> before so let me just quit really
> quickly like what what you guys do and
> uh tell us tell us a little about
> yourself what's what sign are you like
> absolute bored right uh yeah I'm Mark
> I'm the game director for satisfactory
> which means I keep track of division and
> I do a bunch of design work as well like
> balancing and stuff like that
> and I'm a programmer and I did a lot of
> the programming for blueprints and other
> systems in the game but uh most recently
> blueprints stressing out yeah stressing
> out about blueprints yes
> yes so uh yeah remind me again when did
> we decide to have blueprints it was
> pretty recently right it's not a whole
> lot of development time I think the
> proper decision was uh started this year
> it was at the beginning of the year we
> did like a big look at the backlog and
> everything that was in there and
> whatever could stay and should go yeah
> and we had a big push for blueprints
> there was like multiple people that were
> like we should really do Blueprints and
> uh so we decided to do them and then I
> don't know when we made the decision to
> do them now but yeah my first I checked
> my first submit for when I started
> prototyping it was uh late August and
> then I got pulled up to do update six
> stuff so then it's yeah it was
> basically at work started working like
> September I think yes
> very neat
> um so yeah some people asked like what
> do you need to build what is the
> material I can check I can check my own
> here because I get them rolling on it
> come on
> is it working all right I'm pause
> that's a lot of stuff
> just list that
> wait wait that's not correct though
> isn't it if you build it yeah there you
> go yeah why does it say it's like uh
> monitor frames wires concrete and steel
> beams yeah magic I'm not going to give
> you the ratio you have to figure that
> out on your own and uh the unlock cost
> uh the same Parts but higher amount of
> gotcha uh so I already forgot this but
> this is tier four right is this part of
> the mam or is it part of the general
> like online no it's just in the tier
> yeah okay so just in a month it sounds
> gotcha we actually moved one of the
> Milestones to tier three because we felt
> it was getting a bit crowded in uh tier
> four and it's the the one with the Xeno
> measure in it the improved melee combat
> one oh gotcha because the costs were
> kind of like
> to your free costs anyway you don't need
> steel Landing here to unlock it so it
> made sense to just move it now they both
> have four Milestones but that's just a
> little thing I don't think that's gonna
> impact anyone in any way yes
> um so yeah if you guys have any
> questions about blueprints feel free to
> shoot them our way like while we're
> doing this
> um because this is not like this is we
> don't have like we didn't play it
> anything no no we didn't have a plan
> anything so we're just going to talk
> generally about Blueprints and like the
> designs we were working so hard yeah so
> we can start off a little bit like
> we can start off a little bit like sort
> of the I talked a little bit in the
> video on the major Decisions by
> blueprints because we've talked about
> this a long time about how like if we
> ever do blueprints it's not going to be
> just like copy this part and paste it
> there there's been a lot of like
> work on like what makes it like figuring
> out what makes blueprints work in
> satisfactory
> because like
> like I said in the video like it ruins a
> big part of the game if you're just able
> to just like copy paste everything
> willy-nilly
> um so uh I think it was Qantas who
> pitched the like idea of having like a
> building yeah uh I don't know when he he
> recently told me again when he made when
> he thought he made the pitch but it's a
> pretty old one yeah I think it's from
> backend update five
> he made the concept for it yeah and
> we've stayed very stayed very true to
> the the concept as well remarkably Drew
> actually yeah like the Prototype like
> the markup State mock-ups he'd done was
> like it's basically Less Pretty version
> of what we have which I think is kind of
> amazing it's it's identical to the
> Prototype uh building we had I think
> because it was the the Prototype mock-up
> was just like beams and then the ramp
> and like are you talking about oh yeah
> when we were looking into how the the
> model yeah yeah work yeah yeah we built
> like a thing with beans oh yeah oh right
> yeah yeah to try it out and when when I
> when we were going when we're making the
> trailer or the teaser video I saw that
> mock-up and I thought that was the model
> first and I was like I don't we have it
> like celine's like we don't have like we
> don't have the model yet but I'm like
> but I'm looking at it it's in game it's
> done yeah
> um but yeah it's kind of it's kind of uh
> interesting because I think one thing
> for for my perspective is like it's kind
> of hard to gauge sort of how Community
> would sort of
> you know take blue like if you say if we
> were just to say you know hey we're
> making Blueprints and that was it I
> think a lot of people in our community
> would have a lot of different ideas as
> how they want blueprint to work and I
> think in in a lot of cases you don't
> really need know until you try it sort
> of what makes sense or not because it
> sounds good on paper that you're just
> able to just click copy paste everything
> and just
> no builds huge manifold of whatever but
> I think uh from our point of view like
> satisfactory has always been sort of the
> Minecraft idea that like you are
> painstakingly putting everything
> together
> so
> yeah and I still think there's like
> different opinions and that's probably
> why there were discussions in the past I
> mean it's the same thing for zooping
> right where there was this idea that you
> had to kind of build everything by hand
> and there's certainly satisfaction that
> comes from that but we also realized
> that there's a lot of tedium there and
> one thing that I was really happy with
> when we did the zooping is that
> realization that now you suddenly have
> way more time to do other decorative
> stuff in your factory and you burn out
> less quickly from the game actually just
> allowing you to do more fun stuff yeah
> and I think it's going to be the same
> with the with the blueprints yeah we
> have to find that balance because we
> don't just want people like you
> explained already in the video I like to
> just plop down entire Factory lines we
> kind of want them to puzzle around with
> it make modular pieces maybe share ideas
> with each other yeah and really keep the
> gameplay alive and they're rather than
> just it becoming a copy paste yeah I
> don't I mean I don't know if you guys
> remember how tedious it used to be to
> place I think of 4096 signs at once no
> it was really tedious right right but
> now oh you mean again no no you can just
> do it over and over yeah we all need
> four thousand
> oh you know who you are
> but uh
> yeah like I completely forgot what
> am I trying to thought there
> um
> yeah so so a lot of people were asking
> like in the video like if we're gonna be
> able to Zoop blueprints I don't think we
> are all right no no we have uh I I never
> went into this in the build in the in
> the video but there is like different
> build modes for the blueprints because
> they do stack and like you can
> um what's it called Snap them towards
> each other and stuff like that and I
> think that's something that we're also
> going to be probably working a little
> bit more on it's like how the snapping
> will actually work because like if you
> have uh actually let me jump into the
> game and I can demo a little bit uh uh
> which button is it it is this one
> build a new blueprint Chef uh no make
> well now no but I can sort of show it
> off here so
> um unfortunately you are you the jetpack
> and stuff like that didn't carry into
> the this Pawn but uh we can make two so
> it should be close though
> let me kill it
> where did you put it it's I think near
> the waterfall okay I'm gonna go find it
> later we don't have time
> uh so yeah if you do something like this
> uh I'm just gonna do half of this for
> now
> the friend like wow amazing blueprint
> fantastic
> great job
> gonna limit this how yeah
> I'm like I don't know
> uh that was you guys job well this is
> doing a good job what's that directory
> where it creates
> this menu blew my dude
> holy uh
> [Music]
> with this menu and I'm like so I guess I
> have to make this work on the back end
> though
> all right holy so uh quick Creator
> like this essentially you're creating
> the menus that we have in the game
> essentially like with the categories and
> stuff like that this is easier to use
> than the way that we yeah it's so funny
> uh
> cool cool guy whoops
> cool guy
> can I put Emojis here
> damn it
> all right whatever trying to crash the
> game on stream dude I love it
> it's gonna happen
> I I I'm pledging for this uh
> babe okay so the thing I was going to
> talk about is um
> if you place a blueprint such as this
> one
> um
> and uh for instance this one you can
> snap to the blueprint like left and
> right oh this is a bit iffy here I found
> a bug
> you're holding control yeah
> is it because of oh okay you're not
> built yeah
> this is what I mean like there's
> different build modes for this as well
> so like it will snap differently
> depending on what
> um
> what build mode you're in uh and I think
> it's also changed a little bit since I
> made the video as well because you used
> to have to have like the vertical build
> mode as well to be able to snap them
> like this uh but now it's possible to do
> this but if I do this
> let's see if how this works because me
> and Mark talked about this yesterday
> yeah so now it snaps to like the it
> still has like the
> the whole blueprints
> um and it's like it's possible to like
> maybe have it so I have calculates like
> the bounding box for yeah I think this
> would probably be iterated on yeah um we
> talked about doing that but uh but there
> are some issues I mean there's more
> things that we need to fix still as well
> so we will look into that further but
> this is this is a good point actually
> because we do need more feedback on this
> because one of the big things that we're
> wondering still is like how do players
> want to build yeah with these maybe you
> have like a crazy idea of combining
> Blueprints and then we need to somehow
> make sure that the system does
> accommodate that yeah exactly
> um because
> I haven't said this actually but this is
> important I'm gonna go to the full
> screen for this part but uh yeah this is
> the first iteration of the release of
> blueprints like we are going to be
> equipment working on this uh we actually
> wanted to do a little bit more for this
> release but we really really wanted to
> release at the end of this year so
> usually what we do is we delay you know
> if you feel like we're not happy with
> the release we usually delay and it's
> not like we're not happy with this
> release but it's more like we want to do
> more things I think with Luke Princeton
> uh what we have right now I think this
> is a pretty solid like first iteration
> though but
> there's more coming is what I'm trying
> to say
> um I can't say exactly what's coming
> because it kind of depends a little bit
> of of timing and production but also a
> little bit on you guys like when you
> feed kind of feedback we get
> um because you know it's kind of like we
> haven't had that much time to ourselves
> to like try and see what how what kind
> of emergent design that comes from this
> yeah and I think that's uh that's kind
> of the problem and we knew that when
> when getting into it as well that we
> were not going to be able to finish it
> to the Quality yeah because we normally
> go for but we wanted to get it basically
> in player's hand so we can see how
> people start using it so we don't waste
> time developing features yeah like that
> yeah yeah that's a waste of time check
> up our background oh yeah that we waste
> time on stuff that people don't even
> care about and then you know yeah and
> it's going to impact the game to such a
> big extent it's kind of important that
> we get as much feedback as we can before
> we reach our 1.0 deadline here's the
> dedicated server by the way it's it's on
> this so I just want to show real quick
> if you were wondering what the other
> side of this workbench looks like this
> is what it looks like uh with the sick
> monitors with the missing type
> that's really cool uh blueprint storage
> box yeah your refunds go in there when
> you dismantle so you don't have to you
> don't get little boxes and stuff
> everywhere
> actually because I was like constantly
> whenever we were looking at I'm like why
> is there a portable box like what is the
> point of that oh yeah I didn't get it in
> there oh that's so clever and then you
> can also load it up with stuff that's
>  genius it's a big brain moment
> so if you put stuff in the Box to set
> account for like the building yeah so
> it'll pull from the box first and then
> if it doesn't find in the Box it'll try
> to take from your inventory holy
> dude big stuff that is big brain
> I did not think about that holy was
> that a pontus thing I mean it's always
> had the stuff I feel like it was yeah I
> think that was part of the original
> design even because it's always had the
> storage box in the in the concepts uh
> and I never got what the point of that
> was other than like maybe just for
> Aesthetics but not that makes that that
> that that makes sense that makes sense
> though
> um
> so yeah
> um who is this pontus what a letter
> um do you guys have any fun blueprints
> you want to try and make uh um I wonder
> who I actually want to check one thing I
> wonder if we fixed this bug
> checking up yeah but it's actually kind
> of relevant because like can I say
> something about bugs real quick so I
> just found some uh railroad tracks I
> would have avoid them immediately in the
> internet printer yeah there's uh some
> issues running them and at least one
> crash can result if you connect from an
> outside track to an inside track
> it's not it's not supposed to be
> possible but you can currently so you
> know what can I complain about something
> I have I have an advantage here because
> I'm on this side and I'm playing the
> game and I am like literally you
> literally talking what there's a bug
> that's been in the game for a long time
> oh okay you know how we have like um and
> this isn't directed you I know yeah I
> know it looks like I'm like uh
> um
> [Music]
> what was I talking about yeah so so
> you know how we have like Bill and
> release it's like a future in the game
> um there's one item in the game that
> ignores it and slatters it's ladders you
> have to press twice
> wow see if I release that's literally
> unplayable though still
> but I don't use build on release like
> your together game designers
> um
> I think this is a very different
> implementation on this one oh yeah I
> also made this before zooping Yes
> actually okay fun story actually zooping
> came from this moment of building the
> ladders you told me this yeah yeah so
> like the name zooping came from Mark
> being like building a ladder and be like
> Zoop yeah I think we were like talking
> about how it should function and I tried
> to just explain it without it yeah
> I need the soup all right
> um let's see okay so let's build uh
> because one thing that I found when I
> was testing this is that every every
> blueprint is like still based on like
> the 4x4 uh like uh origin so like when
> you're placing blueprints they're always
> based on like the full uh scale of it
> yes and I'm curious if that's still the
> case or not
> uh
> because there's uh there's like a very
> specific uh shout out to to DC van who
> taught me with this by the way uh oh
> they fixed it yeah nice job uh this
> was very buggy or maybe oh maybe
> hell yeah
> it's funny you guys don't you guys know
> what's happening yeah it looks great
> snoon yeah
> um put that right up there you guys have
> no idea how buggy this game can be
> sometimes like you you think it's bad on
> experimental you ain't seen okay
> I'm just saying uh but that's how it is
> when you're developing it no but um so
> so one really cool use case here is like
> if you're building uh did I mess it up I
> think I messed it up
> all right close enough
> I I went too far but you get the point
> so like there's a lot of builds where
> you do like uh
> static kind of stuff like this and it's
> like you know to make an angled pillar
> like this it's like a bunch of different
> steps you have to take uh it's nice that
> you can just be like uh curved killer
> very nice
> suit and then we'll put that in the I
> never named the category uh oh I should
> eat the auto save dude if you've tried
> to save a blueprints never mind
> let's go
> uh uh best category
> and then we'll put like the car
> apply
> and then we'll create another category
> whoa we'll call this
> the second best
> and we'll use the thumbs up
> I don't know if it was meant did you
> mention it that you can share these too
> yeah yeah okay in the video yeah yeah
> I even showed the the oh okay which
> maybe doesn't make sense because like
> we're on a div building like the
> directories because do they create the
> directories for the bloopers as well on
> the library yeah it'll be under the save
> game and then Blueprints and then under

> all right now it can be like
> description over here
> Hello friends dude I'm gonna use this so
> much I'm gonna put it on my heart bar on

> when I uh
> when I test this that didn't work yeah I
> didn't it created like a new one oh yeah
> that should be fixed oh oh oh it's oh
> this this is the same moment I had like
> when I made the video you have to like
> create the or I know I can just move it
> actually this is that was not scripted
> in the video by the way some people said
> that it was it 100 wasn't uh I was legit
> like what just happened
> where'd it go yeah we're probably gonna
> change that so it's not it's like if you
> load a blueprint and save it again it's
> going to be in the same directory
> uh do we have a quick key for the
> blueprints uh no right now yeah because
> we have like X and you know q and Z
> available
> is it gotta expect a hole oh yeah I
> think so I think we we had something on
> there and then we removed it
> for a long time
> uh now it's like a map yeah man yeah
> nothing says math like Z yeah yeah yeah
> we would expect to M because yeah
> uh
> uh see here yeah nice yeah so now that

> how am I just like pointing out the
> that you guys will never see
> we got to remove a beam over here
> important
> save again this is something to set the

> add blueprint here
> yep that's kind of Jackie isn't it yeah
> I guess but just try to add and see what
> happens it should it should game crashed
> yeah yeah just kind of a weird
> interaction
> all right and then uh yeah and I can
> just
> as many as you want baby like that's so
> much that's so much nicer than just
> having to do that thing over and
> over again I had this in one of my
> builds where I did exactly this whatever
> but it actually lines it would actually
> look good but
> um it was such a pain in the ass to do
> this same with the curved building and
> yeah everything like this because you
> can do so much cool stuff yeah and then
> you only have to do it once and that
> happened yeah you just copy paste it
> yeah
> [Music]
> um
> and I know a lot of people feel like
> that oh it's just four by four it's like
> nothing it's like pretty much useless
> um but I I just I used to agree kinda
> but I kind of disagree now when I tried

> you can do really
> like even if you can't put like a power
> plant and like hook it up you can still
> do like the hookup sort of in in the uh

> saves a ton of time you know being able

> say you have like more four belt or
> whoops so you do do this right uh and
> then you just pull a belt from here
> and then just do like you know stack
> make a bus or whatever you know stack
> this stuff
> um
> you know doing this in the blueprint and
> just doing it once and then figuring out
> like where to apply that in your build
> is is very it's still like in the in the
> um
> in the like
> atmosphericasm here but like The Same

> making figuring things out how it
> applies to like the 3D and how you can
> design the pieces yeah a little bit yeah
> exactly uh rather than making a whole

> yeah there'll be a couple of those we
