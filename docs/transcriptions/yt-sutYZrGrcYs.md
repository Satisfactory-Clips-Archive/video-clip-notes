> of course if you won uh while you do this i can get an update or like a rerun of the state of dev because some people asked about it um and the state of dev is that me and jace finally know what the [ __ ] is in the minor update of the game so if you don't know which probably everybody already hopefully does because we've tried to communicate as much as we can but uh we we we're probably not going to release update 4 until early 2021 so next year hopefully in january um but we're we're gonna release a minor update before that uh a minor update or a minor update it's it's it's one of the two uh so we're gonna release a minor update before update four so it's gonna be like uh in between three and four uh we would have liked to say it's a 3.5 but it's not 3.5 because 3.5 is already out and uh versioning is is doesn't work like that anyway um so we're calling the fluid update i guess uh or something the the november update uh and that's coming in like a few weeks so it's not super far off and it's it's not gonna contain like it's it's contain it's gonna contain more than i thought initially when they told me about this when i didn't exactly know what was in it the only thing that i've heard is like it's going to contain like bug fixes and you know optimization stuff but essentially the content you're going to get is some update to fluids now exactly what that entails uh i wasn't sure about until two hours ago three hours ago yeah three hours ago um and uh yeah it's gonna be hype i think yeah and we're going to be teasing a little bit what's coming in the coming weeks leading up to it um and hopefully you will like what we add and good times will be had by all but we're all waiting for update four like that's gonna be the juicy one but there's gonna be some good stuff
