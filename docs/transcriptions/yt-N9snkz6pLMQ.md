> so that's one thing another thing that I want to address too that I've already seen a few comments about but I wanted to save it a bit, some people have been asking what happened with the cheat creep

> and I've been asking around a lot so if you don't know what this is and I sure as hell didn't I learned this I learned about it last week and I didn't fully understand it and now today I actually do understand what it's about, there's apparently a few there were a few apparently a few foundations that like didn't have any collision at all, and, that's weird because all cl all foundations have had collisions some point so that bug has probably like showed up at some point without us like realizing cool but we also haven't fixed that that the fix for that bug we have no idea where that came from, and I even got like let's see what this let's see if this was about that, yeah and we even went on like those like a bug hunt or snoop on in the in the submissions to see if anyone had like worked on that or fixed that we have no idea that was fixed so that was just fixed by by accident apparently no idea, but the thing is like but the thing is now the foundations are working the way they were supposed to originally I guess, so, so yeah but we do hear you we do hear that this is something that you guys want, and, I don't know what what we're gonna have to reconvene and think a little bit about this because, this is an awkward awkward situation for us, but, we we definitely want to like solve this issue for you guys we want to we want you to be able to build the the way you did before, in some manner or not and we will think about like what the solution for this might be if we go back to turning it off or if we can make a feature out of this and make some something out of it, to make it easier to so that you can like do whatever you want in that regard but I'm not sure exactly what solution will do, but, just wanna let you guys know that we know about it and, the goal is so that you can get back to that point where you can build like that again but if that means that we turn off collision or not for those foundations or for all foundations or whatever or if you may over or if we make like another way to build like that, maybe snap to, to heights like the same matter, I don't know we we we don't know at this point I just wanna let you guys know that we know about it ,
