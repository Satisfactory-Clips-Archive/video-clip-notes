### Transcript

> can machines be rotated like foundations in update five no they can't they machines will still rotate the same way as in update four yeah so I think you're referring to the 45 degree angle thing that we showcased, but you just put a foundation down right that you want dude it's so funny I didn't realize that was a feature, until you made that video because I thought it was a book that foundations rotated like that I was like why are the foundations so weirdly rotated sometimes I don't get it is that is that intentional I don't think it is that's good man it is intentional all right you keep going I'll be right back yeah I got it, placing them on a rotated foundation yeah they'll still like snap the same way like as if if you were snapping it to a regular foundation, so if you rotate a foundation 45 degrees and place a building on that then yeah it will still it won't yeah it will be aligned 90 degrees on that foundation and that foundation is you know by nature rotated 45 degrees on the other foundation thus transitively the machine will be rotated 45 degrees I guess a lot of math going on here I don't like it, so yeah
