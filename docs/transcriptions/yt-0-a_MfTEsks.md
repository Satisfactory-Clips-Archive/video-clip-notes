### Transcript

> can you fix the issue with mod users lose hard drives if their restart or crash uh i don't know exactly what that issue is but um maybe maybe not it kind of depends on what the issue is but it's also like here's the thing with a lot of modding related issue is the game is that we have it's not really our responsibility to like fix modding related issues uh because we don't have official mod support with the game um and it like sometimes we do help mod makers uh it depends sort of what the issue is like if it's stopping you being able to make a mod as a mod maker then like then we look into that stuff sometimes but uh when it comes to like these type of small things then it's not really on our table at the moment um so yeah those but maybe in the future we'll fix that in some other thingamajig i'm not quite sure but for the most part it's it's like not our highest priority to help out the mod issues
