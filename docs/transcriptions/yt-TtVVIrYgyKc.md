### Transcript

> any updates on what might be done the Mark III miners MK5 belts, no I don't have any updates but I'll make a note of it and I'll ask and then maybe we can talk about it next week but I'm assuming that the update will just be we're gonna do something, we still don't know what- I we're in this weird situation where I don't know what we're gonna do maybe Mark knows what he wants to do but one thing I can tell you is that even if he knows and if he tells me there's a chance I may not tell you what we're gonna do but what I can tell you is that we are going to do something about it there are multiple Solutions there could be quicker belts that could be multiple outputs there could be, rescaling, resource numbers in general evenly so that like ratios don't change but things just output less so that yeah so it's all the same just the numbers are smaller effectively and that's the solution as well which could fix a lot of things like because I know that, we may need to do that with fluids anyway and so maybe we should just do that with belts as well, but yeah I don't really know how that will actually work out
