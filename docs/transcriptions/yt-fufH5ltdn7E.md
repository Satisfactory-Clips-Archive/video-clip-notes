### Transcript

> what about holes for foundations i assume you mean like uh like improvements to like being able to pull through things through foundations and stuff um maybe i don't i don't think we've ever discussed this fully internally um but i think there's some potential for something like that i personally think like a way more streamlined way to handle um like pulling conveyor belts and pipes through uh walls and stuff it's not is to have it like you can just drag it through the wall and it will like dynamically update the wall i think that would be the way to go i don't think it's an easy solution um but but i think i think that would improve it significantly if you didn't have to use like a special wall segments to like have you know a predefined set of like holes where to pull uh pull pipes and stuff it would be much simpler if you could just drag drag it towards the wall it would automatically update that stuff um i think that's that would be cool but we haven't really talked much about that internally i think maybe we should try and bring it up more
