> in the end it doesn't even matter i love nirvana my favorite band hey everyone my name is jason i'm a community manager at coffee stain studios and today i'm going to be talking about mods uh we don't have any updates on the official mod situation we'll go into that a little bit in a second but uh we have sort of talked about mods and sprinkled information here and there in the past across other videos and on on streams as well and i thought that it would be good if uh we just made one like super video that had all the information in it uh responding to certain questions or comments as well so that's what this video is gonna be so let's just get on with it vamanos does satisfactory have official mod support so satisfactory currently does not have official mod support but we do intend on doing that uh you know adding it into the game at some point in the future we don't really know when that's going to be or what that's going to look like yet at this stage so uh you know once we do know i'll you know make another video in the future and let you all know about that but at this stage we don't really know however there is a thriving unofficial modding community out there so um if you're interested in playing satisfactory with mods i'm going to leave some links in the description down below to the fixit.app website which is a website that has like all the mods on it it also has links to the satisfactory mod manager which is a tool to install and play satisfactory with mods super super easy to use that thing's like voodoo magic it's amazing and then also i'm gonna leave another link down there to the unofficial modding community discord a lot of people there are super active there as well so if you want to start playing with mods or have questions you can go there and ask them if you want to get into modding as well i'm sure you can go and ask there and they can point you in the right direction as well are you okay with people modding satisfactory yeah so so there's some people that seem to feel that maybe we don't like the modding community or that we're against people modding satisfactory is it's kind of strange that that happens but it does the comment does come up every now and then and so i just want to talk about it uh yeah we absolutely support the modding community they do amazing stuff we've featured them here featured mods here on this youtube channel we've featured members from the community on uh the stream before we've made changes to the way that we build the game to make it easier for them to uh mod the game as well you know we've done a bunch of things to help support them uh as much as we can so we absolutely love them they're super impressive we're all for it they have our support all the way great job everyone will there be steam workshop it seems like it's a no-brainer but there are actually a few reasons why we shouldn't have steam workshop support i don't know what we're going to be doing whether we're going to have it or not but here are the reasons for not having steam workshop first of all we don't want to fragment the modding community basically so not everyone that plays satisfactory has access to steam and or the steam workshop so we would prefer it if all of our mods were in one sort of repository that anyone can access regardless of what platform they're on kind of like what the unofficial modding community is already doing that would be great so people on steam people on epic whatever they'll be able to uh use mods and if we have two different things we have steam workshop and this other global thing then it means people well one it means we have more work to do and two it also means people who are making mods have more work to do because if they want everyone to be able to use it they're gonna have to target steam and this other thing some people might not uh target the global one and just target steam and then now we've fragmented the the community so only some people get access to certain mods and we don't want that we would rather have a level playing field for everybody kind of what the unofficial modding community is already doing we're you know that's that's uh that's useful to see what they've been doing uh so that we can find a good solution ourselves when it comes to it and also like you might be saying yeah but steam workshop is super convenient and it is but but but don't don't don't count out the uh the satisfactory mod manager that the modding community has made so far that thing is super super easy to use and super convenient so like there there are convenient solutions for everybody uh without steam workshop we'll see what happens in the future when that happens but i don't think i don't think steam workshop shop is is a necessity i don't think it has to be uh implemented in order for there to be a good mod solution are we influenced by mods so uh it sort of depends on what you mean by influence if you mean are we influenced by ideas that the modding community has come up with um not too much because we've been working on this game for years and years before you guys even knew it existed and so we have like pretty much any idea you can think of in our backlog so when a mod comes out with you know that seems like a new idea because it's not currently in the game it's probably something that we've already thought of it's super rare that a mod comes out with something that we haven't thought of it is super super super rare no we don't really get influenced in in that way so much but there are a couple ways that we are influenced so we are influenced by feedback so when people use the mod a lot and love the mod you know then we get a good idea okay these people like this mod and these features so that's a data point for us when we decide to think of like what features we're going to be adding in the future however that is usually sort of like mirrored by just community feedback in general anyway so like if you took the mods out of the picture we'd probably be getting the same feedback anyway the other way that we can be influenced is just just by seeing their implementation of things you know sometimes we check mods out and we we just see how they do things and that sticks in our brain and maybe in the future we can pull uh inspiration from that kind those kind of uh implementations for our own solutions in the future you stole feature x from this mod oh boy feature x it sounds like something for powerpuff girls we have implemented features that did already exist as mods but as i said we already had the idea for it it's just it's just inevitable that there are gonna be mods that come out uh with features that we intended to add just haven't added yet that's just gonna happen and it's happened before uh the first thing that comes to mind is lights you know there was a mod with lights uh before we implemented lights uh and that's just gonna happen again and again and again it's only natural honestly people are going to make mods of things they want to see in the game and we have ideas of things we want to see in the game and eventually those are going to collide so that's only natural right but i can say for certainty uh there to this day there hasn't been a mod that came out that we've looked at and said how well we didn't think of that let's just let's just take that and put it in our game just just as they've done it just copy paste that's that's never happened and i don't think i don't think that that will ever happen why haven't you put x feature into the base game it can't be that hard there's already a mod for it so there's a mod for that is a very popular phrase within the satisfactory community um but again this is another thing that it's only natural that there are features that have been made into mods that haven't been made into the base game yet and there are a few reasons for it it could be that we don't want to make it maybe we've tried it we don't want it maybe we like the idea but it's it it sort of breaks balance in the game or something and so it's probably not a good idea for the base game but it's you know it's great as a mod uh it could also be that um that we actually plan to that it's in the plans that we want to do it later we just the modders beat us to it that's all but the other thing that you need to remember here is that there are different levels of responsibility between what features we add to the game and what features modders add because there are different contexts here and two contexts are one mods are free and they're opt in this is super important they're opt in you choose how you want to modify your gameplay experience base game features are features that are not opt-in they're there for everybody and they're they're designed to appeal to everybody from minute zero of playing the game into hundreds of hours of playing the game for for people with different kinds of play styles right people pay us they've paid for the game they expected a specific level of uh quality uh stability all that kind of stuff so we have a higher level of responsibility for features we add we can't just add random features really nearly we rarely add one feature at a time that's something you'll notice we add a host of features right because a lot of features need to interact with other features or need other features to be justified in their own existence like all of these things are carefully calculated and designed and thought through every time we add anything to the game not to mention that we have to make sure that they've got they attain a certain level of visual quality user experience quality ui needs to be up to scratch it needs to be stable it needs to perform well uh it cannot break the balance of the game if you break the balance of the game a lot of features start to crumble on top of each other and stop making sense so like these are a lot of things that we need to take into account whenever we add literally anything to the game but modders don't have to do that they don't have that responsibility they can make whatever they want and if people like that thing they can just add it if they don't like it anymore they can remove it so with that difference in mind that is why there will always be features that aren't yet in the game or may never come to the game now i hope it doesn't sound like i'm like on mods and saying that mods are like broken that they're all inefficient and that they lack quality that's not the case at all some mods are absolutely outstanding in their quality but i just want to just highlight that there is a difference in responsibility here between a developer's base game feature and a moderate feature it's the wild wild west when it comes to mods and uh but it's we don't have that luxury and i think it's a good thing i think it's it's nice that we have that both exist um you know people can be safe knowing that we will always ensure that there's a good base game experience for anyone who plays the game uh and then it's nice to know that they can also then modify their gameplay experience if they wish to do so themselves i'm using mods but my game is crashing can you help so we get a lot of people asking for help with crashes etc um and they're but they're using modded games or that they had used mods before on that save file uh and then remove the mods but the mod still had some sort of like lingering crash effect or something we've had that happen in the past as well and unfortunately we cannot help folks out with that uh it's just it's too time consuming it doesn't always end up that we can actually even help anybody anyway we don't know how the mods work we don't know how the mods interact you know we don't officially even support these mods so we can't really help people out so if you have any issues with mods please consider going to the modding discord talk to people there see if anyone can give you some insight unfortunately us coffee stain can't really help you out with mods at the moment you're using the mods at your own risk if you do choose to use them that's just one thing that i need to throw out there actually one thing i will say real quick is that if you do use the satisfactory mod manager to install mods please be sure to use that to uninstall the mods when you want to uninstall them we've found that people have uh lingering crashes etc if they try and uninstall a mod manually so make sure you use the tool for uninstalling and and uh and installing and that's all i'm going to be talking about today everybody so i hope you enjoyed the video i hope it answered a bunch of questions that you may have had and uh
