### Transcript

> are any buffs to the auto saving and servers coming, no not yet one thing I don't know have we talked about this we are chain we have changed that's actually affected too much but we've changed a lot with no I did talk about it in the announcement video we've made it to that, levels it doesn't actually affect you guys any at all like apart from that you getting better performance rendering wise but we changed so that like the way we save the the level now is is made in a very different way so we're doing sub level saving now which means we we are like dividing up the chunks a bit more now that sounds like oh that's going to improve like streaming wise but it actually doesn't do much, because we're still streaming in a lot of stuff at the same time but we but it is improving like render wise, so so that's a bit better I'm looking forward to seeing, that stuff, because it's been a while since we did we pushed patch with like optimization stuff so I'm curious to see it it always improves like this is the heart I don't know you guys probably don't see this because we're actually measuring stuff but we are every time we do an update we always see like performance improvements, around like across the board, and I know that people are like no you made it worse blah blah blah but like that for the for the most part it's better like it is unfortunate that sometimes for some people in certain situations it actually got a little bit worse but we are we're chipping away at this stuff
