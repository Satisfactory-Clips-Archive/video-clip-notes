> are the power shards working well or are they bugged none that i know of or we don't know if at least i'm speaking for entire studios so i know everything we they know uh but i haven't i haven't heard anyone talk about that so that that's news to me i know there are certain aspects in the game where like some things don't work fully as intended depending on like how it's set up like with the pipes and stuff like that still allowed just look into that either but the powershard thing is a new one i haven't seen before so i don't i don't know if that's i don't think i think that means that it isn't maybe an issue maybe something with the way you configured it or your understanding of it maybe uh i don't know none that i know of at least there's no common issue with them to my knowledge and i'm sure someone's gonna be like actually snook you didn't you know the power shards if you set it up in this specific setup they completely break and then we look at it as like it doesn't break it just doesn't work the way it's intended all right we'll look into it when we can't it's unacceptable
