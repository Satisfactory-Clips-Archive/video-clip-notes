> So content creators who signed up with us a while ago before March 5 by a Google Form or by me directly. You will all get a free copy of the game. You may have pre-purchased the game already, and if you have you didn't need to perse. But you can use Epic's refund policy to get rid of it. And then use the key that we give you. OR, don't refund it and use the key for a giveaway. You will get your key at the same time as everyone else. March 19. 5PM GMT. There's another subset of content creators specifically YouTubers big, medium, and small that I'm going to be hand-picking. Umm... me and this random dude downstairs are going to be doing that. And yeah, it's not going to be everyone. It's only going to be a few people. And if you're a content creator or like a specifically a YouTuber and you want to know if you're going to be picked, just check your e-mail or... yeah. Just check your e-mail and if you... weren't sent a key within the next 24 hours, then you just... didn't get it. Ok? And for those who we do select, we're contacting you by e-mail or maybe through another channel if that's how we reached out to each other to begin with. Hey. Jace from the future here. I forgot a little detail. So if... you are a content creator and you still want to sign up as a content creator, the only way to do that right now is you sign up at keymailer and I have left a link below to our keymailer and you can register there. The thing with keymailer though is we're going to send out some keys on March 19, 5PM GMT. But we're not sending keys to everyone on keymailer so it's just kinda, you just gotta get lucky and we're not just going for big people again. Big, medium, and small people, but not everyone. Ok? So uh... yeah. Back to the video.
