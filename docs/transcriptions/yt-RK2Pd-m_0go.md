> what's the percentage of incoming crash reports are caused by mods it is somewhere around like 80 or something like that it's it's it's a lot like we can tell uh when um when mod support came into the game like we were the first to know okay and when people started saying that that is that that is the that is the yeah that's how it is that's also kind of why like we have a hard time supporting people that have used mods because we don't know if it's because of us or it's because of the mods even when people like have had used mods and they're like uninstalling them they can still run the issues that are caused because of mods and then we have no idea what the hell is going on um so uh it it is really tricky we have to filter our crash reports from audit users so should we not support submit the report if we're using mods but that makes things easier for you it doesn't matter for us because we're already filtering those out so it doesn't matter uh it it's not like it's taking up you know it's actually kind of like in in some ways it's good to know you know that that's still the case that like it would be nice to see like that mod uh crash causes go down uh if that happens so i don't think you guys should care about that stuff honestly like submit your crash reports regardless if you see mods or not uh because we won't like it gets filtered out anyways for us so it doesn't really bother us too much it's an issue when like people reach out to us and they want help and then we have to first like figure out have you used mods at some point in the past because people don't realize that like even having saved with a mod uh can still cause issues in your save file even though you don't have it installed so just service
