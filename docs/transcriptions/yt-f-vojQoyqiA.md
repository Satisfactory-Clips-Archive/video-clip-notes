> how many hours do you guys have in your playthrough I have about four hours what about using it I mean I've worked on it quite like does it count like the work hours or because I did look it up yeah it's hard to check like I know I've got 475 hours just on steam yeah but like how many of that is work hours I don't know yeah probably because I had I have I had around 400 an epic and then I had 400 on steam, and yeah that that doesn't include the work time or like working on it and we don't really play it when you're working on it though but let's see yeah I've got, oh you the bed there's also we have like five different versions as well yeah we're trying different versions because we have more versions or maybe maybe you haven't been in because like we have also have like our eternal versions that are also on steam and epic and those yeah don't count in the same pot so to speak so I have even more hours there
