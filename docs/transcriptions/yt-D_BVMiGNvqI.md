> uh would you add uh monsters to any bosses in the future yeah we've got at least one month uh sponsor that we're gonna add that has uh appeared in the initial uh reveal trailer uh and also in our animators developer highlight um and it's a big crab and i don't know when we're adding it we've been meaning to add it for quite some time but there's some issues with that and i think it's considered a boss um but in any case that will be added and probably other things yeah i think that might be update five i don't know that's me speculating but i don't know because there's we were intending to add it to update three and then we needed to rework like the ai system for it and we're not going to be able to do that for update 4 but maybe update 5.
