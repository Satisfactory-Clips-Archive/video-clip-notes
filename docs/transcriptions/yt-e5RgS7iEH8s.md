> pls3 question same with FSR no plans for it at the moment because we would need to change some of the rendering techniques we use in the game but also the game isn't too GPU heavy it's more CPU heavy so like the car the graphics cards that support the LSS and FSR they're so new that like and there's so few people using them so you won't see like a huge gain even if we did implement dlss like the LSS is more like supposed to be mitigating using Ray tracing where you actually do need more computational power for, graphics cards so it doesn't make sense for our game to add it at the moment but I think, I think it would do a little bit of difference but it's not like on the priority list this is what happened because of CPU bound because it generates new frames that's not how it works it's it's tied into like, you still need the CPU cycles and that's stalling the render thread because the render thread can't like operate outside of the CPU thread or like they they if the CPU stalls it will stall the GPU and vice versa so if you are CPU bound you can't like it doesn't really improve it
