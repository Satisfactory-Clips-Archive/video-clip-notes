> any plans to extend the blooper designer to be bigger than 4x4 at the moment I don't know if we have- I know that, I don't know there yeah changes to the blueprint designer, going forward that was always our plan but like what exactly those changes will be are to be announced to be determined, obviously we did obviously we did hear that

>, some people wanted more or wanted a bigger building area but at the same time that's, necessarily I don't know we'll have to see we'll have to see like we have to weigh everything up because it's one of those things that if we if we launched by five would be good, the thing is if we launch the fire by feeling people probably would have just said we want six by six unless there's like some reason people can give us why actually five by five is the magic number then I think we would go to five by five but I get the feeling since where it's like I feel constrained when I build in the, blueprint designer which is intended you're not supposed to feel like you can build everything in it so that's the thing so like we can hear that that, that feedback but I'm not entirely how director Mark or the team weighs that feedback, I'm sure they hear a bit like I don't know I don't know if it's something that we should yeah maybe we should maybe we shouldn't, we don't really want to make those sometimes you know we do Backtrack on like when we say like we're never gonna do this and then like oh actually I mean not never because there's definitely a few things that we're never going to change but there's been cases where we've said like we're probably not gonna because we like it this way and then after the fact we're like actually maybe it's not that big of a deal but one thing I think is important to take note of though when it comes to the blueprint design of Psy specifically is that just increasing it by One Foundation is like a huge change actually because like, I think, just increasingly by One Foundation size increases decisive by like eight times or something like that it's not just you know that additional, Foundation size is like actually quite a huge size difference cubic wise at least, so that's why like that's not an obvious fix so to speak but we kind of like the 4x4 I think I think more so than we thought we were a bit nervous that like, maybe she'll be five by five four by four like which is gonna be best but I think we're actually, pretty happy with this actually we have right now but we'll see what happens, apparently I'm lagging my audio- I'm thinking it might be my stream I could Define last try and restart my stream, choppy and I think some of my words are getting lost yeah you might need wait maybe it's because I need to move this over here that's just how you talk man did that do any better he's missing audio missing I'm not dropping frames on it might need wait it might be that just don't need to restart this thing all right Jason's gone for a few seconds nobody can hear nope just gonna restart the the Stream on, not the stream stream but the the receiving end of oh should I restart my no no no you don't need anything so I just want to see if this, wait was that enough is it wait I think that could be I think it might still be is it still choppy it doesn't seems fine seems fun at my end seems gooder yeah just keep going let us know if it's still bad yeah yeah we're approaching end of stream anyway let's hopefully it's a problem if if you can't understand me though if nobody keeps chopping yeah so far seems to work okay hopefully it's fine now yeah a couple people have also been saying that like, going from four by four by four to five by five by five doubles the volume I think it makes it like eight times the volume I think wait is it that much yeah it's like we're going up one but yeah because it's because if you do the math right it's like eight times five eight times four, eight times eight times four thirty two, times yeah so 32 times 32 30 32 000 right so if you do 64 times 64 times 64 it's like 262 000. but why wait why are you doing 64 by 64 by 60 because it's it's five by five five by five so it's 125. wait eight 8 times 4 32 plus 8. oh that's true that's true of 40. it's 40 times 40 times 40. it's because I that's 64. so yeah I say it's twice the size yeah yeah so yeah I don't know we'll see let's see yes it's because somebody wrote 64 by 64 and 64. right right, but yeah- I we hear a lot of the feedback around it and there's like other things that we could maybe do to improve blueprints so we're going to do a bunch of those hopefully it helps
