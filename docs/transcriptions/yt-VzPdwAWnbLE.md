> smart splitters for whoa it disappeared when I pinned it wait there we go smart Splitters, and, or sinks for fluids so do we have to stick to the pack unpack with overflow packed items method so, smart splitters for fluids I'm not quite sure what you mean by that because you can't mix fluids you can only have one fluid and one pipe segment so it doesn't really make sense to have a splitter unless you want to split like different ratios which you can with the the vents so maybe I'm not understanding but when it comes to like syncing fluids that's yeah definitely something that we've intentionally not had added to the game because we want that like little challenge that you do have to pack them if you want to sync them and that's totally something you can do but then you need to solve that like logistical problem right, but it's not impossible that you know we cover on this like given so please post on the QA side if upload that I'm pretty sure there's already a ticket on it if you if you really want to see that and, we'll see what happens I guess indeed thank you
