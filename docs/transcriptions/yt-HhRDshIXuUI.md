> has a morale that's pretty good I'd say I think I think we have a situation at coffee stain where like half of the team I'd say roughly have worked on the game since launch like since the very beginning like since the Prototype and that stuff and like half the studio are people that have been you know coming in and out and, have a more fresh take on it so I'd say like have the studio really want to like finish the game and like get it out and then half of the game half of the people still are like let's do more let's do this cool thing and this cool thing and this thing and I want to contribute with something like that and blah blah so so like it's a good mix I'd say, that I think coffee stain Studios as a whole really want to get it out there and finish it up but, yeah still still a ways to go I saw someone comment that apparently some people think that 1.0 will happen in January it's not gonna happen in January, let me tell you
