> sup you beautiful bastards hope you having a fantastic Friday welcome back to coffee stain studios and let's just jump into it hi I'm Jase the community manager here at coffee stain studios and welcome to today's Q&amp;A video obviously by now you've probably seen the satisfactory reveal trailer if you haven't I've left a link to it in the description down below I really recommend checking that out before watching this QA but before we get into this QA I'd like to think the people over at whoop the developers of factorio weed gave satisfactory a little shout-out on their factorio Friday facts number 247 blog post blimey which is super cool they said they liked the trailer and they'll be paying the game immediately like as soon as it's released which is like a huge compliment to us it really does go without saying that factorial was a genre-defining game and was a huge inspiration for satisfactory however we here at coffee stains two years believe that within the factory simulation genre we will both occupy different spaces there should be room in people's steam libraries for both games I think and a big thanks again to worm for the shout out and if anyone out there hasn't played factorial I highly recommend it if you were at all interested in satisfactory you will definitely love factorial so please check it out on Steam now regarding the Q&amp;A there were a lot of questions and today I'm for the most part gonna be focusing on the most frequently asked questions I couldn't get around to everyone's questions today because I'm not a superhero and I have video games to play mostly old school runescape I really need to get my hunter level to a tee so on to the questions will there be months so we had actually been planning month support from the very beginning and we even have the foundations laid down for it but what we found was it was adding so much development time to satisfactory and what we really thought we needed right now is to get the base game right get it tight robust and running smoothly so because it was adding so much development time we kind of stopped working on it so we don't have support for right now can't really promise that we will have it now or in the future but it's obviously a really good idea so we're gonna see what we can do general plans for personal launch so people have lost questions about like DLCs loot boxes microtransactions post launch updates and how long are we going to support the game for multiple maps for example we will most likely support the game off the launch I think we kind of had planned that if you look at our past games we have supported those off the launch like goat simulator go to a lot of DLCs even free even a free DLC sanctum sanctum 2 even has been out forever and we have been supporting that there's been like updates for that game over the past couple of years so it is really likely that we're gonna support satisfactory post launch as for DLCs that is something we've like heavily considered but whether or not we'll have it I can't confirm or deny microtransactions will not be in the game nor will loot boxes as for multiple Maps I mean right now we need to focus on the map we have now again it's a handcrafted map so we don't really know right now we don't have this like epic plan where we know everything that's going to happen so as Oscar Game Director said in the PC gamer interview you will not have to defend your base and the main justification for this is again the map is huge and traversing it can take some time and you definitely don't want creatures destroying your base your perfectly optimized base while you're ages away and you're unable to come back and defend it basically so while you're exploring you're gonna be running into hostile creatures so let's not forget about that it's kind of dangerous out there and what about turrets to defend your base Shh if you want tarts place thank them too will there be lizard dog or plushies I I really hope so that's a that's a fantastic idea in the past we have actually made goat sim and goat Zi the DLC plushies so regular goats and zombie goats so I think it's likely I mean I talked about it with other people here and people here are stoked to do it whether or not we'll have them not sure that if you want them keep making some noise and I'll keep telling them that people want it so we'll see how it goes how many alpha Keys will there be what are my chances of being selected when will you be sending them out how will you choose who gets them we don't know how many alpha keys will be sent out we don't what your chances are of getting an alpha key we don't know when we're sending out the alpha keys and we don't know how we're choosing who gets an alpha key so I hope I hope that answers your questions general multiplayer stuff you can play the game in single-player without the need for a server or anything like that in multiplayer we officially support one to four players but we're probably not going to limit that at least at first so you can just like add people and just kind of see what happens as full privacy settings on the servers it is currently limited to friends who can just any friend can just join your server or private where people can join via invitations we probably going to have public setting at the moment because that can easily be grief or assignment as your dedicated service it's something that we really want in the game whether that's gonna be for the Alpha or later and it's something that we've kept in mind during development so hopefully it should be easy to add into the game when we when we do do it but it hasn't been tested extensively yet so we can't promise dedicated servers at this stage but personally I'm pretty optimistic about it is the map procedurally generated will there be procedurally generated resource locations there will be nor procedurally generated maps or resources I have no idea if that's something that's going to change in the future or not a lot of people have expressed some concerns that if there is no procedural generation there will be no replayability but please understand that we have kept replayability in mind during development and we have some plans for it but of course we're still welcome to suggestions especially suggestions that don't require procedural generation will you localize satisfactory into X language we definitely plan on localizing satisfactory we've localized like all of our other games to many different languages we plan on having some localization support in the Alpha and we also plan on using community driven translations and localization because we've noticed that that reached the best rewards over the long term and so if your language is not supported at first we will probably be adding it at some point but you know just let us know that you and we'll see what happens will there be autonomous drivable vehicles will there be water vehicles there are no water vehicles again whether or not that's something that changes in the future I have no idea as for autonomous vehicles they're in there that's something we've publicly confirmed already and all autonomous vehicles will be drivable is there an end game will there be a story yes there will be story and an end game as for the story we've actually already revealed two characters Katharina parks and Steve and you can find their names and hints of their personality on our website so check it out will there be Mac Linux console cross-platform support yeah possibly we've done that with all of our past games so it's likely but I can't confirm or deny that right now we just really need to get the game running smoothly and in order to do that we're just gonna focus on Windows for now is that a space elevator at the end of the trailer yeah it is a space elevator and it actually takes you to that big thingy in the sky and that thing is actually a food court but they're sort of burritos Chinese food kebabs pizza and curry is there a height limit in the game how will verticality affect the game there is no height limit or the kind of the kind of is it's the skybox and is ooow qy tester has actually hit the skybox before when messing around but we may enforce that in the future because you know it could break the game will close performance issues but I don't know like maybe that's fun maybe we should just leave it as it is what do you think maybe tell us what you think in the comments below as for how verticality affects the game it is actually crucial to satisfactory is our biggest advantage for being in 3d right and what it does is it allows players to build bigger factories in a smaller surface area and so if 35 squared kilometres sounds a little small to you which some people have said please take verticality into account if that's still a problem we can make the map 35 by 35 kilometers I really hope people get that reference and don't actually expect that was the reveal trailer a cinematic or was it shot in engine the trailer was shot completely in engine and all the first-person shots were taken in game and all the free-foam camera shots were also taken in game but some of the free-form cameras had cinematic cameras with pretty settings so that definitely makes the game look better but most cinema most freephone camera shots did not use cinematic cameras we will also be leaving cinematic render quality in the game in case you can run that so there you go let's talk about Simon are the delays really his fault are the things you blame in for actually true yeah it actually is always fault all delays have been Simon's fault he even admit somebody's Twitter profile and also 100 percent of the things that I've blamed it for is also actually true isn't it Simon yes see and that's actually all the time that I have for you today so thank you very much for submitting your questions I really hope these answers tie you in for a little while at least we're likely going to be doing this again at some point also sure many links are in the description down below and for every single like comment subscribe follow retweet we get for every single one of those I get 100 hunter experience in runescape so please consider doing that I could really use the help I hope you have a lovely day and I'll see you when when I feel like it bye okay one two three yes
