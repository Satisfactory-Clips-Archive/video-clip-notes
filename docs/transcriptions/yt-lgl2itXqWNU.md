> unfortunately all good things must come to an end and uh yeah this this stream is no exception um it feels kind of weird to be honest because like we we've we i don't think we've missed a single stream since hmm i think i have that wait do i have that in documentation there was one stream in march that we may have missed marv do you know this maybe like i think we've pretty much like since um excluding vacation no maybe we streamed on vacation too i don't think we've missed a single stream in like this year let's see here stream missed no way let me see here 2021 can you count rows here how many of these 51. wait are you serious this is real wait how does how many weeks are in the year again my high how can how can we have streamed 51 weeks i can't be right i'm sorry we have like a document that we we document all our streams and i'm i'm like we've we've made notes um and there's been 51 streams this year we've probably streamed more than once a week then is the only conclusion i can come to right because how many weeks are left this year damn okay um that's kind of weird have we not missed a single stream since the start of the year that's wild i have a hard time believing this like i need to actually double check this but um because now it's the fifth week but uh according to this list we have streamed 51 times this year including this today um which would mean that we have streamed like pretty much every week this year every tuesday um even during vacation that is okay okay cool i'm just like grasping this january 12th yes he wait yes so there's two weeks there we missed but but since january 12th we've pretty much streamed every single week so it's gonna feel a bit weird not streaming a couple of weeks like i i know that i took a break too um but in the past jace has kept going but now we're on a break on our christmas break we actually did this last year too actually that i noticed our last stream last year was on december 15th um so we we usually do take a christmas break but that's super cool i didn't wow year so many streams i can't believe you guys stuck around for so long um there was a week or two where you started update five teaser season when you didn't upload anything but that's for youtube right like we always streamed uh even when we don't have teaser season we always stream uh possible we missed one in summer i i know that we've had a couple of here and there that we haven't done um there's like there's two on the list here that are not filled in so i think those are the times other than that we pretty much streamed almost every week this entire year so yay um yeah can you post a staff pick of all the devs we don't have a staff pick of all the devs right now because it's covered so uh we would have to photoshop one if we did it was strange tuesday now on until next year but enjoy the holidays yeah um it will be weird for us too i think um incredibly good so uh yeah i don't know what to say like it's um we will we will be going on a break um we will be back don't worry we won't stop streaming i think we enjoy streaming and uh hopefully you guys enjoy watching our streams too hopefully you guys get something out of this um and we will be back next year it's uh yeah i don't know what to say like it's i just want to thank everyone who's been here throughout the year watching our streams and interacting with us uh helping us make the game better um like all the support that we've gotten is is so humbling and it's so amazing in every way and it it's like it makes my job is really easy in a sense because we have really do have such a wholesome community and uh it's not just like when you guys interact with us but also i am so happy to see like just how well you guys also interact within the community um like judging from the various like smaller communities that have created their own like discords and stuff like that and you know the language discords um and also like on our discord and like on our reddit and stuff like people are so helpful um and on our forums so it's just it's just so good to see all the good vibes um so so thank you so much everyone who's been a part of this journey this year you guys really make the game what it is honestly um it would satisfactory really is like that kind of game where the content is king in a sense so you know if you guys wouldn't have built all the crazy things you do then it would just be us making stuff and it would be kind of meh like we're always surprised at like how creative our community is so so thank you everyone so much for being here being a part of this journey and looking forward to more of that next year we'll still be here and we will still be making you know videos on our youtube up until leading up to updates or releases or whatever's gonna happen next year um you know we'll be keep we will be streaming again next year um and uh yeah if i don't see you on the internets until then i hope you have a great
