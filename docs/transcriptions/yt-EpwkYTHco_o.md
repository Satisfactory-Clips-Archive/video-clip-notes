### Transcript

> his console cross platform on the post 1.0 roadmap, I mean maybe it's something that we've always we've never written off like we're not like we've we've never thought, you know yeah we would never we were always open to, console being a thing and if if we went with console we would probably want it to be cross-platform and the cool thing about using EOS for the multiplayer networking and stuff is that that kind of really helps with cross-platform on a lot of things including between console and PCs so I think if we ever did go through console, there probably would be cross-platform and there is an interest of doing console, it is something that has been looked into but like we can't really say one way or another what we're doing there, and right now we are just focusing on PC we just want to focus on that and we want to make sure that works, and we're not really at a point right now where we want to start making necessarily design decisions around getting the, you know getting the gaming console because I think at the moment like if the game can't go to console I'm not sure if anyone at the studio is going to be super heartbroken about that I know that there's a lot of people in the community that would be but I think that's just how it is at the moment but we'll see how it goes we'll see how it goes I feel like satisfactory would have a lot of UI ux changes to support console right now it requires so many keys yeah yep that's one major thing for sure yeah I think the UI is probably the biggest thing, and I'm not I'm not a UI designer so I'm not really sure how ready our console our UI is for console but, as it is I don't see it working super super well I like I mean I think it could work but to have it have the like ux you know the user experience that that we have now on PC to be that smooth on Console I don't know if it's gonna work as it is but you know we'll see we'll see I'm sure it's something that we can solve good luck with cross-platform yeah and that you know if we had if we were doing cross-platform all along my God it would we would we would have spent so much time with random things just to make cross-platform work and make consoles work and not actually create new things for the game it would have like you know I don't know satisfactory 2.0 yeah how about Gamepad support, I mean Gamepad support is maybe something we can look into later it see this is the this is the tricky thing this is kind of the same thing about consoles so it's true if we just added Gamepad support that's not the same thing as having all of the console related work that needs to go into it right but, but like still we'd probably need a lot of changes to UI to make that feel good at all we could add some Gamepad support so that you can just move around and do the basic things if that doesn't already work because I know there's some people who do play with Gamepad, but if we say that we support gamepads I personally I think we would then have a responsibility to make that functionality like good it's it's one thing to say you have support for something and it functioning poorly in a way that's not really support even though it technically works so we'd have to make sure that we get that working really well and that would probably come with a look at a lot of UI changes so
