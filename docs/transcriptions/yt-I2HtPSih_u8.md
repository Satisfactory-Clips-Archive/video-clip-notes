> why did you decide to make the ma'am into a separate building i'm not exactly sure but i do think one reason is so that you can build the ma'am while you're moving around i think that's one i don't know if that's the only reason, yeah and it takes up a bit of space you know like if you can build the mam outside you know it could be that it's in the hub and then you also build it outside, but, i don't think we wanted that but also wait you can't build the man from the very beginning can you can you i forget that could have had something to do with it too
