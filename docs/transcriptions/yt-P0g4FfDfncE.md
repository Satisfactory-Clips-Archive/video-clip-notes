> bugger feature I have two characters in single-player save game every time I load the game I get another one so that's a bug, certainly not a feature but what you can do is, you can kill them just go and beat them up and then they disappear, and also, they drop whatever items you had before and, it's certainly a bug in the game it's sort of a bug it's like an unintended feature because we wanted people to be able to rejoin a session, but unfortunately when you play offline or, when you don't like we connect your online account to the player so if you can if we can't get that then blah blah blah we're gonna solve that eventually yeah yeah, because it's it's something that has like a pretty simple workaround just go and find the old version and then kill it and then take the loot but yeah that's not an intuitive workaround and a lot of people you know stop playing because they're like I lost all my stuff it's on this other thing and I can't and I can't get it so, it's definitely something we need to fix
