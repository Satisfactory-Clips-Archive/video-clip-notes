> and actually so this is also good so someone says is there a way to consolidate votes for identical or similar enough posts, because there's a lot of duplicates and that the things are getting diluted because of duplication you don't really have to worry about that so much ideally there are no dupes and that all votes just go on to a single thing but that's it's it's honestly not realistic to get every single duplicate we just encourage people not to duplicate post because it doesn't really help but it also doesn't hinder that much because the reality is we have real people who check the qa site and so if they see that something's been posted 10 times you know whether or not, it's from different people or same that they'll they'll see that has been posted a bunch of times like that they can sort of analyze what's going on yeah, and you know in some cases people might especially when you're into bugs and stuff like some people might be encountering the same bug but it might be like because of different reasons and then in those cases it's good to like have you know one post being like this is how i got that issue here's my log maybe or here's my save file or you know this is what i did to get it and it's because of like reason eight and then somebody gets the exact same issue and they see that i'm like oh it must be because of this thing and they upload that instead of posting you know their own save file or their own log file and then they still like when we solve that issue for person a then person b like it's still an issue but yeah i don't think you guys have to need to worry too much about that yeah obviously we, we prefer if if you know if you're uploading like a feature or something and you're really in if you read one of the posts and you're like i really like this feature for instance the ones where you're the ability to play golf for instance like that's a cool feature then upload that definitely definitely upload that can't wait to get it in yeah real people that's right guys
