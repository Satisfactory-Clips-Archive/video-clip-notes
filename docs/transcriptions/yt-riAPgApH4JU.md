### Transcript

> I love tacos I do too I do too tacos are good tacos is a very swedish food right snip sure I mean swedish tacos are very swedish I don't think, it's like tex-mex tacos is it taco friday in sweden taco free yeah freedom taco friday is a thing, I don't know where that came from, I think we used to do it in my family as well instead of tacos on fridays I don't know what the deal is with that with meat two of the most swedish foods you can get here in sweden not tacos and kebabs yeah actually honestly more than meatballs like yeah people it it's like all those classic trophy swedish food that we have like nobody eats that it's it's like sometimes kebab pizza exactly the bad pizza is tacos and kebab pizza it's very swedish yeah but it's also but not to be confused with like proper tacos because like swedish tacos are like kind of vanilla no you know- I think I think they're about the same as like any other country that like that just just makes tacos that that like I'm sure that if you went to taco is a mexican right yeah I'm sure that if you go to like mexico and get actual tacos they're going to be different that's that's what I mean like it's not like swedish tacos aren't really any different to australian tacos for example I think it's it's also yeah that's true because I think the us also has that kind of like tex-mex taco thing where it's not really tacos it's like it's it's taco bell like isn't it a thing where like taco bell isn't really proper mexican food it's just like I'm assuming it's not yeah, but that's that's okay like if you eat swedish tacos I think you're and you're respecting proper ones then, you're gonna be disappointed yeah but I like him I like both things here yeah it's a big thing here
