> what's up everyone its chase from the satisfactory team here we're here with an awesome update we got a lot of new features coming to satisfactory and one of them is actually good but before we get into that I want to say a huge thank you to the for the response from the community all nine of you a lot of you are playing the game and given amazing feedback thank you so much for that some of you do hate the game and I just want you to know that we do hear you and we hate you too before we get into the features I just want to talk about a couple new changes to the community the first is that we are now opening up localization to the community so that anyone who wishes to help with translation can do so we're also changing up our roadmap because the current roadmap was not going to be working out so we're currently working on that right now more information about both of these things can be found in a link in the description below so let's move on to the features a lot of these new features people have already played on the experimental version of the game but now that the experimental version is stable we're moving it all over to the main version so everyone can enjoy it the first feature is a highly requested feature the conveyor lifts conveyor lifts are a thing that can vertically transfer items from one can variable to another so this should no doubt reduce some of the spaghetti in some of your factories for those of you on an lchf diet the next thing we've added are two new resources quartz and sulfur I don't know what they do because I don't play satisfactory I prefer to play factory town we've also added a map to the game a lot of you wanted a map and we wanted a map too so now it's in the game and you can't see everything on the map at first but we have then introduced a new structure called the radio tower that helps out with that we've also added a new vehicle to the game a lot of people wanted a new vehicle a lot of people requested a flying vehicle like a plane or like a drone well we didn't make either of those but we didn't make a car we've added the Explorer to the game it's a fast paced vehicle that can drift and it makes exploring the map much quicker and much more fun and I think you will all enjoy it as much as we do we've also reworked the hand slot it is now a tool belt that can hold multiple items that you can switch between the number of items it can hold depends on how much you have upgraded the tool belt we've also added a thing called the novelist detonator it blows up rocks and stuff and it opens up the map and exposes resources and just helps establish dominance in general we've also added a rifle to the game it is a rapid-fire weapon with a capacity of 10 rounds and it will really help show lizard Agha who's boss some of you who played the experimental version of the game may have seen a rifle mark - that was not supposed to be in the game and has since been removed so these are just some of the updates coming in the patch but there are more like bug fixes and optimizations a full list of patch notes can be found on our website there's a link in the description below to that for anyone interested I just want to say we're really excited to see what you all do with this and I really hope this all opens up a whole new world of satisfactory for you all thank you
