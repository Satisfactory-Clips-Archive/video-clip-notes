> you sure could use them fps dlc when now that's the hard-hitting question that would be kind of cool actually what if, we actually talked about that not at not a conference name but we talked about this, as a joke obviously don't conspiracy but like what if what if you made a game and you had like a hard like fps cap or something like that and then you work and then you release it and then like a month later you release like the the performance fix and then you just release that cap be like yeah I fixed it runs so much better now like I wonder if anyone's ever done that you know part of me wants to believe that nobody would do that no no person in the right mind would do that but this is the the world we're talking about right where anything is possible ea would do that nah 10 per fps oh my god but as dlc like no you'd be crucified if you did that there's no way I would pay that I get I mean I guess wouldn't you rather have that as like an update to the game though you know I don't know so reddit thread about, software compass to do something along those lines but why it feels counterproductive that's like the pinnacle of like capitalism right there it's like is it really about making the best product or is it about making most profit they got sued over that see that's the thing I think that you would actually get through for that or would you I don't know nvidia dlfps let's get started then yes sure see like it's not like that's going to be done before at one point oh I'm all right all right wait the other way around it's not like one point we'll be done before that am I right
