> the flush yeah will be happening with the trains and collisions i heard singing will be implemented will trains, avoid, collisions, as far as collisions i have no idea as for signaling that will happen right yeah that's gonna happen it's like, i don't know exactly what the plan is but we're gonna do something with trains like it's gonna be it's update four now like either not update four oh really yeah no i don't think so trains is probably gonna be later down the line, but we're gonna do something with trains we've said that since like the very day we implemented them that there's more to trains trains are in their infancy, like we're gonna do like either like a single system or you know some kind of coalition implementation thingamajig like we're going to do something with trains to to not have them like clip with everything, but i don't know exactly what that entails i think it's also tied in a little bit with like the vehicle system maybe because we're also looking into like rip what we're going to do with this next to doubt trains because we haven't decided that either yet exactly how we're fixing all that jazz
