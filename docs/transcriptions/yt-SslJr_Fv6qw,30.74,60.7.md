> uh hi hi I'm Natalie and I'm the UX designer here at caucusing so this Factory is a very very do AI heavy game first year and a half the UI was just not working like it was working like it it served its purpose it was so boring like it was really boring and was also necessary to just are thinking about UX UI Newark's like they really like they they blend together you can't really do one without the other user experience I did this on my TV once so you could actually target because they're ready if your UI is that like the entire experience becomes bad it's the glue between the designer and the player for example you're you're out to go to this mission and you know you have no idea how to get there but you open up your map and it's just absolute to use I'm sorry so then you're probably going to quit this really screwed it we have like some exploration and like something some narrative in there as well so then Hannah like our level designer and writer now as well she started coming up with like this company and like these people that run the company so like Katrina parks and then Steve and we were able to put a stamp on like who that company was there there was just like no way to reflect that in the UI through that like the balls are rolling to make this operating system for the employees I'll fix it here you're actually a part of like the company and the world and the the UI creates a story for you as well and that's how how do you I finally start becoming fun we were figuring out the workflow like how did we want to do things and what approached it we want to take and it depends on where in development you are so two years ago it was like getting stuff out quickly like getting prototypes out in order to be able like see like does this work do we enjoy it do we need it and the part like it doesn't even really contain any art now that were mostly polishing stuff up it's more about really like tweaking small things we need to change these icons because people don't understand what these icons mean tweaking an animation or that color doesn't really look like it should but a construction menu that we have in satisfactory that menu has gone I think through over 20 iteration it's used so often and it serves a lot of different purposes in the game I wouldn't say UI is underrated but I I would say that UI is misunderstood I want to use a example of like a conversation I have with someone our job is easy right you just drag and drop the buttons in there and I was like where do I drag them to how heavy does a button feel and what do you use it for how should it respond when you release or when you click doesn't have to be a button hey those are all like the tiny little things and with you I like there's always gonna be sacrifices somewhere often players ask for something or like even people here like designers or like means they present a solution it's it's like from there perfectly no it's from their lens from their perspective yes English is not my first life so I say you are a designer you really gotta go in and try to you like to pick out their brain a little bit when it comes to accessibility colorblindness like is a major one and we try to like tailored our UI to people with colorblindness like with the different types as well so we we use like very contrasting colors but for example people that are blind like I I would not know how to design a game or for people that can't see the world I do like read up on the subjects - if you like be aware of it as much as I can I would love to do better in that area I think some people but they can't as a thing like there are tons of blind gamers out there that play games like overwatch and they play fallout any any game you and I play I do like the art and the implementation and the design and that was quite overwhelming in bigger companies like those three things can be separate jobs and they can be like enough to fill up a whole workweek for someone but seems like the last six months we have another UI UX designers now working with - and this is working out very well nice I've actually like gotten much more comfortable with programming we have very nice programmers here that just sit with you and they help you out and and they don't mind doing up you know you're there to help each other out actually like I helped Jace out every now and then the guy needs some help what kind of computer yeah I mean I know what software is but Hartford like it works um I use illustrator I use Photoshop I use After Effects I used to use Microsoft Visio for flowcharts but now I use balsamic to do like wireframes and flowcharts yeah and then there's like Unreal Engine 2 to make it all work I haven't worked with Scaleform or flash whatever the dinosaur used to work but of course you want to try to to step away from like the regular interface that you see a lot I think that space is a really good example but I also think hearthstone was a really good example of like things feel tangible and they feel like they're they belong in that world yeah I think that's what you need to do to make it you I how do
