> you guys does it say anything that you get server message now in the upper left corner especially the part where the steel girders are presented no so those those messages in the video some people might have spotted those in the top left corner there's like little messages from like server or whatever, they're just like debug messages that, like programmers or whatever just leave in to, just give them some extra information while they're working in the future sometimes they just get left in, but when the game ships that kind of stuff gets stripped out yeah so and the specific ones you're seeing in the video is like when you're playing as a server we need to check like this plays a server and then you get a confirmation on client but json server so you don't see that so that's mostly what those debug messages do one thing that we haven't talked about actually that we kind of have revealed and some people have spotted this is that there is a little bit of a change to the ui, in the game when you're picking up stuff, the ui now shows up in the corner instead let me see if i can find the the part of that video on the left right isn't it like and when you dismantle things the things that you get back are no longer in the center of the screen they're off to the side i think that's what you're talking about yes some people are caught change number two for shardy jays
