> is it around 30 megabytes oh geez that's a big one you know it kind of depends how the save is built because you can't due to compression you can't really say that like one 10 megabyte file is like a bigger save file than a 30 megabyte one because it it really depends on how you've, how the file is saved and how it's serialized so you can't compare them in size really until you've uncompressed them and you guys don't see the size when they're uncompressed but even then like save files could be huge just because you like picked off a bunch of foliage but you didn't actually build anything like you could get huge save just because of that so you can't really compare and save us really i think i think it's more down to time it's a better metric there
