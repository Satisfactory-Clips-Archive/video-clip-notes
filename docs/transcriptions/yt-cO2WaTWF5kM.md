### Transcript

> when the train loads and unloads the conveyor belt stop is that by design or a bug and it will be fixed later so that is by design that is just so that we don't run into weird like race conditions and stuff like that, and the way you sort of have to circumvent it is you have to place a storage container, on the like that you're feeding your train lines into, so that when the train is docking that the materials are still flowing from your cont like from your storage container rather than from the train station i know it's a bit hassle that like oh i have to build one extra building for that functionality but that's sort of the the state of that actually, just we there's no good solution around the issue like we'd rather have the solution than trying to solve that because it introduces other issues if we were to have that
