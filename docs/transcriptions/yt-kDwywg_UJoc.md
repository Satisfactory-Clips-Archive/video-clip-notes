### Transcript

> ability to sleep coming anytime I'm not sure but if it does let me know no I don't think it will I talked about this live stream actually because, or maybe oh I thought it was real life I thought you were talking about real life yeah now, mark made a stance on this that, sleeping in the game would be weird because, you'd if you'd be inter introducing a solution a lot of people ask for this because they want nighttime is too dark it would be weird to introduce a fix for a problem without fixing the actual problem which is night time should like it you should be able to see things during night time, but also when you sleep if you're like passing time it would be weird if your factory could speed up because then you could just sleep and like speed up time yeah so we don't want to do that and then it would be weird to like but what if you sleep and you don't speed up time then that would be weird too because like time progresses but your factory doesn't like yeah it becomes weird can you imagine how many like think about how many people right now asking for sleeping and how many people would be asking if we had sleeping that didn't speed up your factory yeah like we would be like slammed for it
