> will you just do a live coding stream make a mod from scratch no probably not, it's a lot of work making a mod you guys it's it's a lot of work it's it's as much work as making the game honestly in some ways, so in some in some ways it's even harder than working on the game because we have access to like the engine and all the source code so it's quite easy for us to like add on top of already exist the modders they have to like inject code into the existing binaries and stuff, and and figuring that out is really really difficult, and we were hella surprised that people were were up for that task to like figure out like to create the the mod inject the mod loader and stuff like that to make it work, because we honestly didn't think that that was going to happen we honestly didn't believe that the there would be a modding scene until we added official mod support, the mod murders are increasing, are crazy and amazing crazy amazing amazingly crazy as well like it is a lot of work and, so, yeah big big kudos to the modding scene they're really in some ways they're they're they're absolutely yeah they're amazing- I don't know I don't know how to like I'm trying to like I don't know how to explain what goes into it because I don't think a lot of people realize just how much more work it is sometimes to create a mod for a game than it is to like actually work on the game itself, in some cases, and that can certainly be true for monster satisfactory especially like the the whole ecosystem of like the mod loader and the all that jazz- I'm amazed that they've managed to pull that off cremating exactly yes
