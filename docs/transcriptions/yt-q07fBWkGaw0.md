> can we get the tick tock Instagram reels posted as YouTube shorts too what do you think, I mean sure there's nothing stopping us yeah I think maybe I wonder though I wonder if we should curate it so that it doesn't we don't flood people's like I don't know how often you plan on posting them but maybe yeah right now it's just you can feel like it but yeah it could be the case where because they yeah they end up in the same sub box right yeah they do with sub box yeah they're now separate with the different tabs on the channel itself which is good but it still pops up in sub boxes and I don't know I'm not a not a huge fan of everyone leaving their their shorts in my sub boxes it gets really really confused yeah, personally that's my experience so I think it's something maybe we should consider because I'm on this since most of our subs they don't expect us to put videos out every every day or two yeah I'm in the same boat I think it's annoying when I get my sub box filled with just especially if a lot of channels are doing it and like I am have a hard time finding like the real videos maybe we can maybe we can like designate like a day a week when if we have a video we can put we can put it up on that yeah maybe on like a Wednesday or something like that so you got like streams on Tuesdays maybe a short on on Wednesday or Monday and then like a video on Friday or something we'll consider it shirts account I don't know if we make a whole new account for sure no that's that's that's that's try hard we're not that cool yeah it's a bit too sweaty also we don't know like how far we're gonna go with a tick tock either because right now it's just like whenever I have time to make tick tocks yeah but I don't know so far it's been pretty cool
