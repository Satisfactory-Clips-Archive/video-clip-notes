### Transcript

> question in the station queue scenario what happens if a third fourth fifth trains why would they will they queue so the way that's gonna work is you can have block signals right so god damn i wish i could somehow draw this but uh if you have if you have a train in a train station then that block of the train station is occupied if you have a train queuing up then that entire block before the train station is occupied and so no other train can enter that block either right so you might end up like so that's something to to consider you might want to make uh you might want to break up long segments of tracks leading into uh stations into multiple blocks so that um you can have multiple cue points otherwise if you just have long segments and only blocks around train stations it may be that while a train is like on route to a station no other train can enter that part and you might have like really big gaps between your trains but that's like something for you to figure out um what what works best for your your uh station for sure to block it anticipation or uh it won't just work yeah exactly i mean if the block is occupied it won't let trains won't be allowed to go in yeah and and you and all of your all of your your entire train track every system will be a block if you have no signals that'll still be one entire block and if you break if you put one signal that breaks it up into two blocks so like there's uh your trains are always going to be occupying blocks and and uh if you have any signals they're always going to be blocking stopping transfer measuring blocks
