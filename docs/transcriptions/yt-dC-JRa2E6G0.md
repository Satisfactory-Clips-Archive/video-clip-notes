> so yeah dedicated servers let's let's uh i'm going to repeat myself on this throughout the stream just get ready for that but uh we're still working on dedicated servers there's a few issues with multiplayer as you may have noticed if you played multiplayer those things will not get fixed just by adding dedicated servers you'll get the feature of having a server running but you also have a bunch of client-side issues that will not get resolved by anyone because there's no hosts to resolve them because currently there's a view there's a bunch of game stalling issues where only the host can resolve those issues and we need to fix those things before we do anything so uh gotta fix that before we can have dedicated servers and we're working on those things and yeah hopefully we'll have dedicated service out sooner rather than later
