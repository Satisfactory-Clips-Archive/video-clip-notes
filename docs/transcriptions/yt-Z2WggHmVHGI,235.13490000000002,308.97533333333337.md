> are we influenced by mods so uh it sort of depends on what you mean by influence if you mean are we influenced by ideas that the modding community has come up with um not too much because we've been working on this game for years and years before you guys even knew it existed and so we have like pretty much any idea you can think of in our backlog so when a mod comes out with you know that seems like a new idea because it's not currently in the game it's probably something that we've already thought of it's super rare that a mod comes out with something that we haven't thought of it is super super super rare no we don't really get influenced in in that way so much but there are a couple ways that we are influenced so we are influenced by feedback so when people use the mod a lot and love the mod you know then we get a good idea okay these people like this mod and these features so that's a data point for us when we decide to think of like what features we're going to be adding in the future however that is usually sort of like mirrored by just community feedback in general anyway so like if you took the mods out of the picture we'd probably be getting the same feedback anyway the other way that we can be influenced is just just by seeing their implementation of things you know sometimes we check mods out and we we just see how they do things and that sticks in our brain and maybe in the future we can pull uh inspiration from that kind those kind of uh implementations for our own
