> programmable splitters why aren't they working and how can it be fixed so we have fixed them internally I think but unfortunately you won't be able to see that fixed until update six at least for some there's like a couple of issues with the programmable splitters that we're aware of, one of them the major one is that programmable splitters change update while you're updating the ui which causes a lot of issues causes a lot of race issues, race condition issues and that's been fixed internally, so, that probably doesn't answer your question but there are there are a couple of things we want to fix with the programmable splitters, but it might be they might be resolved in update six it might be that we want to do like a pass on how they work like the ui on the programmable splitters and then and the stuff like that so we might like redo those anyways
