> so how old are you I am 21 years old saying I haven't been 21 for a while I'm, I'm 34. wow I believe I can't believe it I am 21. jace is a very important person he has a tower yes now what are you saying 32. grandpa jake you're still young yeah still pretty young still pretty young, old by gamer standards I guess well that's not true a lot of that's not true there's like an entire generation of folks who play games before I did like on yeah yeah and atari's- I mean like I remember playing having an atari and playing it but like I was I didn't grow up with that atari yeah yeah yeah same thing jace is 12. I know this because he's my son yes okay 40 plus 43. all the gamers are out here yeah a lot there's a lot of gamers here you say that got a lot of gamers here is it us us old gamers okay looks like we got a lot of gamers here I think the, the like I mean the vibe that I get is that the, player base of satisfactory is a bit older than your average average I don't know they're like older than I don't know yeah we have no idea 30 plus or something you know yeah yeah we have no idea yeah if anyone was curious if that's like a stat that you track or whatever like maybe companies do but we have no include yeah we have a bunch of young folks as well I yeah think of a few 21 here oh I'm an average of staff I'm an average player 35 years old very good wait what age what's the average one 35. that's it epic store metrics not tell you age demographics I mean probably we just don't look you just don't look just like I don't know like see because the thing is if if we looked at some stats and it said your average your average gamer for your game is is 15 years old or maybe not 15. let's just say like 20 years old or it said 30 years old like what am I gonna do yeah what do I do with that information like- I can only I can only do this job the way that I know how to do this job I can't really I go I got nothing else to offer you know if if people are younger than I thought or older than I thought I can't really do anything about that yeah you could obviously argue that like yeah but if you know the age of your audience and blah blah you could, you know make content that fits that age group or whatever make tick tock videos blah blah blah you know like sure but I don't know I think the way we see it is like we cannot we can only do what we can do yeah exactly like so like yeah and we only want to do what we are you know can do or are passionate about you know so snook and jay's tick tock dance videos confirmed look we haven't released them yet okay yeah but they're in the we're baking they're in the oven they're they're cooking I mean if we wanted to like do tick-tock we should just I mean if if I would do tick-tock I would just do nothing but emotional damage I mean there are legit game deaths that do do that yeah yeah I mean I mean an an easy one would be like you know like you accidentally when you when you like mass dismantle you accidentally dismantle like a power line and then emotional damage

> oh that's what you mean okay I thought you meant like accepting self-deprecating jokes types the no no I mean that that specific ticket yeah yeah yeah yeah well yeah it's a youtuber but emotional I love that one though yeah it's really it's really good these videos are really tough how many of us are engineers that's an interesting question I wonder how many people are in the satisfactory community yeah one it would be important to know the age of folks if you want to run a bajillion ads to decide what platform yeah yeah I guess I guess you could do that but fun fact you're gonna target your ads for a specific age yeah but fun fact we don't run any ads almost no not really like we've done some ad stuff in the in the past to varying degrees of success but yeah it's not something that we feel you gonna do that right now elena god damn it wait what the, emotional damage tick tock laner does a lot of tick tock stuff I don't know oh thanks for the idea I gotcha gotcha gotcha yeah yeah you're gonna have to invoice that dude that incoming that tip thing coming free I feel like you don't need to run ads yeah I don't know I think the conclusion we sort of had was that we don't know whether or not ads actually did anything for us yeah like the the thing is like we do stuff publicly on the internets a lot already you know and so like we wonder maybe ads are good if you have nothing else but our ad is good if you our ads particularly helpful if you're already doing all this other stuff anyway I don't know
