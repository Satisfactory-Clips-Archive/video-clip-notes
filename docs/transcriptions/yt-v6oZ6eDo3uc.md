### Transcript

> does anyone company play with mods yes we do play with mod sometimes it's it's a little bit like tricky sometimes I mentioned this before because when we're developing the game and we're working like with with versions that don't exist sort of because when we're work when we're using internal builds then you know we're ahead of the live build, and we can't inject mods into like those builds because the modern community don't know about them so like I mentioned before like sometimes there are tools that would be super useful and beneficial for us when we're working on, like when we're making content and stuff like that that we just can't use because we have to make it ourselves like the time lapse mod that was made for instance that's something that we wanted to make for our internal, sake but we haven't had time for it, so that's the main reason but we do check out the mods from time to time it's fun to play with them and see what what our community are making, both for like inspiration a little bit but also for like checking you know sometimes people make mods where we've been like this is probably not a good approach but there's a mod for it so we can check out how that works and what they've how they've implemented it, and then you'd be like I like that part but I don't like that part and like or maybe reassure us that like yeah this this was a like still it's still a great mod and it's great for people that want to use features like that but maybe it doesn't fit the vanilla game or like when we need to support a much bigger player base so to speak yes yes
