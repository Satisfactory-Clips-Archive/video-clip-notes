> so I was going to say how long have you been working on this update for but have you pretty much been working on it since so yeah, that's an interesting one because we have so we have the main branch where all of the game is on and we have now a separate world branch where all of the world work is on and we copy that over to the main branch sometimes and the main branch is the one that goes like public and we've copied this work over to the main branch a while ago like a few months ago so like we've already been working on other stuff like moved on to other areas it's kind of weird to have this weird delayed release of like we've been done with this for a while but only now is it getting out and I'm like we're now in the middle of progress on new stuff so damn damn damn
