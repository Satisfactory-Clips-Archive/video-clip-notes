### Transcript

> how does coffee stain feel with all tier one tier six stuff in the actual version are you happy or is there a big chance that you want to change it in numbers, it's hard to sort of tell because you know when when we're in early access and, you know one of one of the main reasons we're in early access is because we can then observe you guys and what you do and how you play the game in order to sort of like test what we think is good and is going to make the game a good game and, that kind of feedback can be anything and it can be and and that can change real quick depending on how you know as we expand the game so we'll we'll have to see it's like we can say that well with update four not much is changing between tiers ones and six so I guess mark is reasonably happy with that for now, yeah yeah but you never know like there could be a I don't think we will have like to I can't say for sure but like to that degree of update three where like everything is touched in the entire game we don't have anything like that planned right now or like or anything conceivably that could change the whole game like that not that I can think of yeah, I also really have an idea but anyway oh you jace has an idea just you wait it's gonna be good
