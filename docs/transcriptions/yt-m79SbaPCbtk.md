> it needs rubber and super computers I thought we changed that maybe we didn't- I think one reason as well is that the geothermal are supposed to be like balancing out the particle accelerators because they also fluctuate so they go in tandem because when I made the trailer I used them for the particle accelerator output so that the powers would even out, devs know their game not me it's a big ass game you guys like it's impossible to keep track of everything just cheats with everything so it does use geothermal no I've used geothermal on my on my own playthrough, and I witnessed this because because I've streamed that but the way I did it there was I unlocked it in the in the mam and then I bought the stuff I needed to build it with the, awesome sink so I bought the tickets and spent those on buying supercomputers and stuff so I could build geothermal so you can get it early game
