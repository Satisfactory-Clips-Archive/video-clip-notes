> anyone running by particle accelerator on biomass generators I have I've made a save file when I did that, I made a save file where I built I think it was eight biomass generators and I ran particle accelerators I think I had to build I think so when you're running so- I underclocked the particle generators accelerators I think I needed to build like 16 of them underclocked at like zero point whatever percent to like get one per minute or half of one a minute like it wasn't impressive show us it's on our twitter, I don't know what that save file is anymore but, it was a while ago I think it was update for when was that yeah here it

> will is show up in the thing it will cool okay yeah so this is one build I did a while back, how many are those 12 my mesh generators and I had it's kind of hard to count them maybe 12 is it one per I think it's 12 whatever, yeah I underclocked them and I got like half of one per minute, because I think they're all running at like five percent or something, but they work not recommended doing that though holy the the particle generator particle accelerators are so hungry power hungry
