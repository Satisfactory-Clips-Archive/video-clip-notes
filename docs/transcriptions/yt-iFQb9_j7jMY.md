> any plans on simplifying the late game factories like if it's more like work than enjoying I think so I think, well it depends because if we change up how we we've done that before where we changed how recipes are unlocked so like, complexity was complexities like part of seven and eight or eight I think, and we might want to change that a little bit and make it easier, I think the like space elevator phase four is placeholder at the moment and it's very difficult, so that might change but we might also change like other aspects of the game where the complexity will make sense or something like that so we'll see what happens essentially but it's it's like late game isn't done I think I think we're somewhat happy with early game there are a few tweaks in here there's a couple of retention issues that we also want to solve with early game, so which we're still thinking about and looking into but we'll get to that later and late game is something that we don't feel like we've nailed fully, I think we're pretty happy with like mid tier like early mid, but we'll sort of see I think we're pretty happy with the change we made for update 4 though with the how complex it is introduced, so complexity introduced in tiers six or seven six I think, where you're not you're taught about the complex lines but they're not complex in terms of build-wise but then in 798 it becomes a hornet's nest so, you know based on feedback we'll make adjustments to that so if a lot of people feel like late game is too grindy or whatever then of course we'll take that to heart and make changes to make it make sense you know recipes will change probably so the complexion behind nuclear power was a headache to work around but after the fact I'm barely scratching 10 usage yeah it might the it goes into the discussion of retention as well where sometimes I think people feel like they have to do more complex solutions than they do, and I think a lot of people when they get to nuclear they always think like oh I'm gonna make I want to make this massive nuclear power plants do power I'm never going to make new need to make nuclear again and it's like I don't think that was the intent originally I think that was more like for for every player to feel that way I think the intent was maybe like the you know the top tier players that spend so much time on the game that it doesn't make any sense I'm not gonna name any names but there's a couple people in chat here that definitely definitely

> should feel, like I'm talking about them but, but yeah so so, but so but that is all valuable feedback I think in in in the sense that you know if people feel that retention wise they get burned out on the game at that point maybe that's a sign that we need to look into these things and change the recipes to make sense so that we can retain that but also still keep like the complexity for those people that do want to spend an insufferable amount of hours in the game, so yeah I that emote was made for this moment okay like just posted is that was made for that moment that call out holy, difficulty talking not a difficulty toggle I would say I think more like in in terms of because we have we we've talked about this before right we're interested in looking into game modes and, ways to change up the game and make it more customized in a sense or something like that I don't know we have a couple of ideas but we haven't really committed to anything else at this point I think, so that's that's sort of that's sort of one thing, because one thing that we're gonna look into next sort of is is retention in general for the entire player base, and, yeah long story short good times squished squidged kids
