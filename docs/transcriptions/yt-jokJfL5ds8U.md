> all right next up we have from yetis or yurtis or herthes or however this is a little bit of a throwback you guys if you haven't played satisfactory before update three if you play no sorry before update two before update one gosh gosh so long ago if you if you were with us since the beginning you might recognize this building pattern so this is before we had lifts in the game which was very very cumbersome because every time you wanted to bring you know your your resources up in the world you'd have to do this spiral thing and there were i actually i really enjoyed that time because i knew we were gonna add elevators the fun thing is that when we launched satisfactory we actually didn't have any plans for elevators, for the release of it and in hindsight it kind of looks it sounds weird saying that because like how can you play the game without lifts, yeah lifts was update one so that was before that was before they too, that was the first update we made was lifts and, looking back like i can't like even how did we how did we manage yeah update one was when we introduced elevators or lifts that was that was what that update was about, so yeah it's it's looking back at it now it feels weird and, but yeah here we are look how far we've come i really want to like load a pre-update one save file and just like play multiplayer and just see how different everything is and how like everything looks but also to see how much better multiplayer is right now than it was back then let me tell you it's been improved vastly since since update 1.
