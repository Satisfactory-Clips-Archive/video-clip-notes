>, please make the main game, mode where the monsters are much more aggressive let us defend them from building walls in different areas, so this Strays pretty close to the whole like base defense element of the game which I don't think we we've been pretty clear on that we don't want to go down but this is also what you're saying is not necessarily that they attack the base and destroy your factory but maybe that they're just there and more annoying you need to deal with them all the time I think that if there's a decent amount of requests for that it could be a possibility but, you're gonna have to put that in the QA site and see if there's much more support we haven't I'm gonna say that I don't think I've heard that be requested too often so probably not a huge chance but yeah
