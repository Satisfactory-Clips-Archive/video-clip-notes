Brave no brain brain or Berry yeah, when we met up with them at, twitchcon yes in EU which reminds me I still haven't put together a video oh yeah should totally do that yeah someone should totally do that yeah I've got a ton of, I'm Gonna Keep It on actually you know what I look festive you missed the long haired actually not because like when I put it on I got so much in my mouth yeah yeah and I was like sometimes when I'm eating there's like I'm like God damn it there's like this just hair straight up the back of my throat dude so I pull it out like oh this is disgusting yeah how do people with long hair deal with this because I don't deal with this it just happens oh you have to deal with it I guess so yeah it is what it is it is what it is I don't miss it at all- I miss it a little bit when it's like cold outside, but then you can put on a beanie true and you're still good tie it back tie it back every time every time I mean that's eat I mean that's what I did when I had long hair because that's the only play yeah I'd never had it out almost always in a in a bun says too much effort right okay I have to just carry a head tie with me everywhere I go yeah I guess this is your, this is your calling it's my calling yeah or I'll just get it cut I think I'm getting a haircut on on Monday and I'm actually not sure if I cut it back to the short length that I used to have or if I keep along yeah I'm not sure yet I can't remember it's like whenever people have their hairstyle for a long time I can never remember what they look like before then right I think I saw like an old YouTube video from a while ago where you had, not as long hair but similar it's like that's not Jace that's someone else yeah yeah I don't know yeah press one okay chat decides one in chat to keep the hair long two to cut it back to not it's not short but like it used to be it was kind of shorter one long two shorter three for both and three for deleting Paradise Island, no three three was long hair two was short hair one was the lead Paradise Island yeah if I remember correctly that's what I said that's pretty sure that's what it is one if you want to delete Paradise Island two if you want to delete Paradise Island three if you wanted to leave Paradise Island 69 if you really want to delete Paradise Island eight zero zero eight five if you really really wanted to leave that's a very specific one but we'll roll with it yeah yeah yeah true okay yeah I, you know so I've been I've been I've been out of action for quite a while it's not like I've been here on the streams but you know I watched your video last week and I did hear about Paradise Island being nuked yes well kind of well we deleted kind of deleted kind of actually we're gonna clarify that a little bit more because it's not 100 certain it will actually like Nuke it nuke it delete it deleted okay we might do a thing because the okay the the the thing with Paradise Island is we can't spend more time on it you know so it's like right either if and if we were to leave it as it is it might be it might feel that it's like unfinished right right so we're not 100 sure what we're gonna do, the the idea originally was to delete it, we'll see what happens but it seems like people like it yeah yeah a lot of people are gonna miss it but also a lot of people really miss like the old nuclear power plant model as well so like yeah yeah it's all in the progress of, of progress people are afraid of change yeah exactly exactly so we'll see what happens maybe we'll just like leave it as it is maybe we'll remove it yeah, I always love the, on our map like our internal map which I think we also did like leak externally to everyone, Paradise Island was, just it was misspelled, it was powered, dies yeah d-I-e-s which I thought was great that it was so close to like The Kill plane I think, the yeah I really I really like that I say we rename it to Paradise Island it's kind of funny yeah and then move the kill box further so you can't go there so you can go that's even better actually yeah I like that because, I updated the, the map like the progress map that we had we made one for update five where we show like you know with the starter like with the state of all the areas are so I made an update for that that's on our press kit if you want to grab it and, yeah in in the map it does say Paradise d-I-e yeah, so- I corrected it but maybe I shouldn't have corrected it where I should have left it as it was you [ __ ] up snoot yeah I can't believe this [ __ ] yeah yes all right okay wait are there people who like I guess there are people who genuinely build on Paradise Island I guess because like half of the island is where the kills here is so like it's kind of it's kind of weird oh by the way Chad one quick, like announcement or whatever, we usually have closed captions on the Stream and as you may or may not have noticed the closed captions kicked in even while we weren't streaming or like it kicked in at the part of the stream where you can't see us talk yeah and, and while looking at it I realized that holy [ __ ] that closed captions are so bad, and it's partly because we switched like closed caption system when we upgraded obs, and I didn't realize how bad it was so I'm gonna look into that so we'll just turn it off for this stream, because it was actually usable before and now looking at it it's just like it's just nonsense yeah yeah I was speaking very clearly and it wasn't picking it correctly at all yeah like slowly and clearly yeah, and that was really embarrassing because usually just before like wildest dreams on countdown you know we're going live that's usually where when I give, an update this note about my rash that's been like flaring up lately, and you know every week is like how's it been Jace you know and I sort of fill them in and give them all the Gory details it was I was just about to and he was like yo the caption's there so be careful all right so yeah that's not really ideal either, caption system I'm also going to type it out in chat just in case yeah yeah, so yeah just just an FYI we usually try to keep closed captions on I've had people reach out to me and say that they watch the stream because we've had had closed captions on and they they're like completely deaf so like it's been really useful for them so I mean it's definitely something we want to, what's the word like we want to culminate them if we can exactly got comedy for so we would like to accommodate that and it's been a little bit of a rocky ride since we updated, how's the radish the radish yeah that's that's what the closed captions would say I have a really bad rad rash I have a really big radish why don't you just eat it just cook it up just cook it up, we also have, in the agenda some people have pointed out but we've got something a little special there but above your head over there snip yes Community highlights exactly, yeah see yep that one that's the one I was talking about but this is the one Chase is talking about yeah yeah yeah, so, CEO wants to hang out for a second and talk a little bit too so we can talk to him yeah it's gonna be interesting he's a cool guy so yeah we'll see we'll see how that goes, is Jace back full time I guess we can mention this real quick too, so yeah I've been on break for quite a while and, as of next week I will start, back again I'll be working I'll basically I'll still be doing the streams and I'll be working on the YouTube videos but like maybe not too much more because I'll be working at like just a limited capacity for a while and I'll just like you know work work up to it, work up to, full time again I don't want to push things too quickly, and yeah we'll see we'll see how that goes good times that's, it's the update on that finally you can see you're told to get back to work we can finally get a return of Jace on the on the YouTube comments because people people miss you on the YouTube comments it's funny I also love how people don't want to like people try to not be, like rude to me they're always like ah snoot makes really good videos too but where the [ __ ] is Jace I mean I've been doing all the pretty much all the videos there for so long and yeah it sort of makes sense but yeah I mean you did I mean your videos have always been really good so it's always been fine but like it was it was it was actually nice watching your videos and having no part of it because, I don't know like in a way it's sort of like inspired me to like oh I can do these things with my videos when I do if I make them when I do make them I plan on making them, as well so like that's that's kind of interesting it is like a lot of cool stuff you do it is interesting because I don't feel like I've done anything different compared to like what we usually do like I don't feel like I've you know upgraded their YouTube experience Small Things there's like some small things that I think I was like oh I really like that the way snow does it so like I'll still like little ideas all right yeah but I think overall like we have the same Vibe because we're pretty much involved in everything that we do anyway yeah, to some degree it's always hard to, like when we set the tone of like what the channel should be like it's always hard to like let's come let's do something completely different yeah because like some people would be like I don't know I should I don't like change no but like some people tune in for one specific thing and then it might feel for us it might feel like oh we're just doing the same thing it's not so stale we're not taking chances anymore and stuff like that yeah it's it's a tricky balance it is Jace is better because of hellofresh delivery you know what I mean you say that and for the most part is true I'm kidding, but also I mean it has we haven't had that right we haven't had one a delivery during stream for a very long time so like I picked I peaked last year when we actually got a hell of fresh deliveries well washed up now we don't get [ __ ] anymore it's been a couple of times where I think we talked about this live stream but there's been a couple of times where you were like oh they're gonna show up like a half an hour till late yeah exactly like just miss them like 30 minutes yeah those were those one stream where we try to we try to drag it on because they're gonna be five minutes but they ended up take, coming like one hour later and today it's gonna take like four hours before they get here so yeah it's not happening viewers only want one thing and it's disgusting like I don't know I don't know what they're referring to but I love it they're talking about hellofresh that's what they're talking about okay yeah yeah

>, unrealistic expectation of food, actually I'm actually yeah they still play old school RuneScape, actually not really not not not so much at the moment, but you know, RuneScape players never quit they just take breaks, but I have been playing melvore Idol which is, I think it was a RuneScape player slash fan Community member made it it's like an idol version of RuneScape, not idle is in like the dresses and bright lights and singing on stage Idol is in, you know an idol game where you don't you don't play it it plays itself and, it was all RuneScape based and then like jagex ended up like publishing that game so it's like actually like an official like RuneScape Idol game now so if anyone else out there plays RuneScape and you're interested in a little bit more RuneScape, do check out melvore Idol it's interesting because there is RuneScape Mobile isn't there or something like that yeah yeah but I guess it's like I think- I mean idle games and root Escape aren't like the same thing yeah yeah they're they're they're a little different but the same kind of energy I think if you like one you'll like the other yeah yeah and, I think you know like RuneScape the the mobile version is the same as the PC version, and and you know you can switch between them and same with the idol game too RS idle yeah foreign
