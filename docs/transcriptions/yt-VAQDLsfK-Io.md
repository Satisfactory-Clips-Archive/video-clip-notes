### Transcript

> the track stations also has some changes to the ui so they're like a little bit more clear what's going on let me go back to that yeah here we go so um you can now see like how much fuel each i think this is one cycle right or something or is that like between the vehicles coming back to the same station i believe so it shows like roughly how much fuel your your trucks are consuming um it shows like how much your outgoing rate is uh how much your theoretical max transfer rate is that's in going rate as well if it's in if it's uh well see this is actually this is weird this is a loading thing this should be uh wait load means loading into the truck right yeah yeah yeah so actually no this is right yes this is outgoing yep it would say in going uh if it was like if it was exactly so when you switch it it switches the text exactly um and you and we also changed the the like we used to have like two buttons and it was kind of like not you wouldn't know like wait is it unloading or is it loading is out wait when you press the buttons and hopefully this is a little bit more clearer in the ui um and yeah that's that's that's the changes to the truck station y'all hope you'll like it yeah it's still a yeah it's a tricky trouble uh triggering your problem but maybe we'll we'll uh grab this one yeah i feel like it's less yeah yeah yeah i mean it's definitely less confusing at least to me but uh there's always room for specifically because it says truck settings underneath so it's like that's the thing there it's like are you loading the truck or you're unloading the truck but you're on the station yeah but you also get the the ui changes when you flick it it will say like in going or outgoing um so that also helps a little bit i think um yeah and it's the same thing with the drone ports i believe it's because it's pretty much similar ui to the drone yeah i think i think they're similar yeah so hopefully that will be a bit more clear in the future
