> yeah somebody asked about, we only have one gas in the game right now we can add more i feel like we are it feels it feels weird if we just add one gas to the game, but i i don't know when or what gases we're gonna add or how that would work or if that's gonna change anything significantly i don't think it will, we're gonna have to wait and see you guys
