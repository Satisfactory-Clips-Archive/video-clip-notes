> Seck now where do I not for long hi I'm snoot and I work here I'm subbing him for Jay today Jase was unfortunately unavailable to make this video today and for some reason I'm doing it instead so I guess that's happening it's also partly because I worked on the safe structure that we're introducing in this update and I'll talk a little bit more about that later so here we go so this video is gonna be all about the patch that's coming out on XP rental today it's gonna contain some goodies and some bug fixes but before you run off and try it out there's some very important information regarding save files so make sure to stick around for the whole duration of the video to learn more about that I also urge you to backup your saves your save files are located in this directory you can also find it in the description in the update we're added a few bug fixes for trains most notably we've updated the AI for better break prediction and better reliability so now trains shouldn't like speed pass stations anymore we've also added a fix for the issue where trains would get split up at switches so now if that happens the train should like reposition back together again and I should probably point out that this is somewhat of a temporary solution until we have proper collisions and proper signal assistance for trains in the game we've also added so that you can now ride the train as the AI is driving it we've also added a feature so you can mass as mental buildings so if you want to wipe your whole factory it should be a bill to quicker this was a feature that I worked on a few weeks back on my dev stream and it's gonna be red I'm can't wait to hear what you guys think about it alright so let's talk about safe files and make sure to take notes because this is all gonna be on the test so in the next patch we're introducing cloud safe so satisfactory on the epics game store big bro team Sweeney got us hooked up but in order for us to support cloud safe so we've had to make a few adjustments to our current safe structure of the game so let me first point out that as a whole the safe system will work pretty much the same way as before you can still like grab your safe files and save directory and like share them with your friends so throw them out the window what are you going to do with them the only difference now that save files will be placed in sub directories instead and those sub directors will be synced via the epic games launcher so essentially when you're playing the game and you're saving that save file will be placed in a directory that's associated with your epic account so immediately not all your safe files will be converted into this new safe structure and cloud synced and that's because up until this point we haven't compressed our save files and what that means is that the save files can get quite large and that's not optimal if you want to cloud sync them and in order to do that you need to load up your safe file and then we save it for it to be able to like be converted moved into the epic account folder and then it can be cloud sinks and all the files that haven't been associated with an epic account ID yet will be placed in a fuller called common in the same directory and they'll be placed there until you load them up in game and then we save them again are the new safe files supported in an older version of the game no new so once you switch version you can't load them in an old version anymore so if you do switch to experimental we highly recommend that you stay on that version and if you still want to be able to switch back to an older version then you have to backup your saves so what I need to do so you shouldn't really need to do anything out of the ordinary you can still load up and save the game as usual and everything should be dandy can I disable cloud saves yes so in the epics games launcher there'll be an option there's like a little cog wheel and then you press it and there's like a drop-down list or something and in that list there will be like an option for you to be able to disable cloud safes should I back up my saves before trying experimental yeah what happens if I play offline so if you play offline as in not through the epics game structure then the save files will either be placed in the common folder or in the folder that was last associated with your last login the game I don't see some of my safe Falls in the game so since a Falls are now associated with your epic account ID you will only be able to see safe files that are associated with set account so if you played on another account on the same computer you need to either log back into that account or move the safe file to the folder corresponding to that epic game epic account that you want to be on why am I seeing duplicates of my safe files so this might happen if you switch between versions of the game the duplicates that you're seeing is a result from like mismatch of folder structures during the migration of the safe files when we're doing the migration we don't want to overwrite anything which means that if there's already like a file with the same name we're trying to do the migration we'll kind of leave it alone so what that means is that if this happens you might need to do some cleanup yourself but if you don't switch versions between the game this should trademark not be a problem all right so that's a lot of information if you want more information you can check out the blog post that I wrote about the save structure on our blog there's also more stuff in this patch that I haven't brought up into this video so make sure to check out the patch notes and all that jazz links are in the description so that's gonna be it for me I'm gonna go back to work now so thank you for watching have a fantastic day thanks for being you alright bye oh and backup your safes well find you
