> see if there are any issues dear jason sir we have xmas items back so i can finish my build off please i mean maybe we'll have to see, i would say that there's a pretty good chance, because you know like, update five will be coming out end of this month and hopefully we'll be out on early access in november and maybe that means we might have time in november to make some christmas stuff november and december to release it but we'll have to sort of see hopefully the heavy lifting will have been done by the time update 5 comes out on experimental and will free up some people to do some fun christmas stuff i think that sort of lines up well assuming things are fine things work out well you never know though could be a dumpster fire could be the worst update ever known yeah the jury's still out on that one
