### Transcript

> talking about whatever you guys want to talk about so, yeah update 4 is out one of the biggest issues that people are having if you've played an update 3 and you're replaying again and if you haven't been keeping up with us is that we've changed how power consumption works in in update four so most fuel generators and power generators now consume 100 power, and some of the issues that people have been running into with this is that they're, like power setups will spike and like blow a fuse, and the most common issue for this is because of, like the generators not being set up for 100, consumption I know that a lot of people build like like including kibitz I believe who built like a ton of of nuclear power plants, once those power plants started like booting up into 100 it produced like an insane amount of waste for qbits specifically and in the case for a lot of people a lot of cool generators will boot up into 100 and then blow the fuse because, they need like more water and more coal that wasn't set up properly for that so that's something that a lot of people are running into
