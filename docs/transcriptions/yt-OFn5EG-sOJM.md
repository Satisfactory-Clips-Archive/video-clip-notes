### Transcript

> I saw some people ask about the swamp we will like we're saving like this this stream will mostly be about the aspire coast we have some exciting things to show the swamp because we have changed more than I thought actually much more yeah I was I was ill-informed when I asked about the swarm changes, there are some foliage changes to the swamp and maybe some okay like but maybe some not environmental changes maybe but how, it's it's yeah definitely atmosphere changes all of the foliage has changed yeah all of it, landscaping is much more the same than than spider coast like it's it's seen some tweaks but it is much more similar still to the old the old area yeah it it it is it is, very very very different yeah cause this biome was I think jay's told me this that you took the entire spiders and just deleted it I full on raised everything I just deleted all of the clips there was basically no foliage, and- I basically removed all of the landscaping and all the landscape painting and it just started completely with a blank slate essentially it's yeah that's pretty nutty have we ever done that before, not really since a long time no like it it like northern forest it kind of the the same amount of changes that happens in northern forest is kind of what the the swamp is it's gonna have to swamp so it's mostly foliage and then some like some tweaking of like the landscaping and like cliff fixes and stuff like that but but not much more than that so like your factory will be overgrown but it'll be functional, so yeah it's, but yeah I don't think we start it with a blank slate it'll be sort of similar thing where like you'll get plants sprouting up in your factory but you can still sort of manage it by removing them with the chainsaw or your little bumpy bumpies your little bummy mom's yeah yes where's the swamp don't think I've been there yet you no no no yeah that's gonna say like no no oh yeah I'm not going to show you nice try spoilers do you even have it loaded in I do not yeah because I figured like I don't want to accidentally like show this people who glimpses because I know I'm gonna it's gonna happen if I haven't loaded in so oh yeah professional like you're here you're gonna get me nice right you kids and you're [ __ ] trying to, trick us I've seen it all
