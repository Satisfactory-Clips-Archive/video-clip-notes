> I mean this is to be honest this is one of the more frustrating parts of working on the game yeah I don't know why I chose this topic I mean trying to well for one I'm like I would never consider myself a graphics programmer that's not my expertise but this is more of an architectural thing I'd say yeah that's actually doing any graphics programming you're just right that's true but it's also like the to pick something where there's no, what do you mean like interface between I mean there's an interface but yeah with the usa files like it doesn't know you know I can't like control click on it and be like oh that's not that doesn't exist in this file yeah it's just, it's easy to make typos which you know I like to do it's kind of my thing that's why the that's the t in my name typo dylan I have a good feeling about this though now actually feeling pretty good I think I think we're in for a treat guys can't wait for the 14 000 error pop-ups no no no no
