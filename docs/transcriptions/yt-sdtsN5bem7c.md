> can the clearance modes be configurable in settings uh i mean i i guess they technically could but like you can also not uh build that way i guess like the important thing is really like that it looks good to you and whether or not the the soft clearance bothers you like if it bothers you then it bothers you so you won't build that way i think yeah but if you really really really want a setting for that uh can you i say yeah and um there will be uh extra feedback on building when like if soft clearance is being like breached this this feedback wasn't in the video that we showed but like i think the plan right now is like the hologram would sort of change and stuff as well to make it really obvious that there is like a overlapping of soft clearance um so we will make that a little bit more clear that's the plan anyway as far as i understand um yeah but for the most part i don't think we wanna yeah if you don't wanna if you don't wanna do it then do it yeah uh i have to i to tell this this is this is a little bit teasing uh like for you guys that we would never do that here no we would never do that so i've been playing update 5 a little bit and one one thing that has sort of occurred to me when i was using the soft clearance that i didn't realize is there's so many times when i'm building and i'm like setting up my my setup which i like to build like compactly and like puts things together and makes you know straight lines and all that [ __ ] and then sometimes when i'm like i just want to get this done i just want to get this factory done and i'm like struggling and then i run into a situation like oh no i forgot a splitter oh and i just like [ __ ] i just dragged like belts all over the place and just threw every con like every constructor just just so the belt makes sense and and end up correctly i'm like done all right next thing and that was impossible without soft clearance before don't you guys wish you could do that it's it's so it's so nice it's just so [ __ ] like do that and just like all right [ __ ] it i'm out of here like it works okay i don't need to replace the constructors and everything it's just like like a whole new game right snoop update 5. oh so good love it especially when you've built like um you've placed like oh i got my 4x4 grid here and i'm gonna build a tower and then you build a tower and then you build place your constructors like you realize oh [ __ ] this doesn't fit at all i don't give a [ __ ] it's going in there so yeah
