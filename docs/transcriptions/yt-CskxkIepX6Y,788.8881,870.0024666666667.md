### Transcript

> please let us know so one question that we've sort of seen pop up online uh about these signals is whether or not like intersecting tracks will work with the signals will the signals take those into consideration when it comes to like determining what what trains are in a block etc uh and which lines are part of a block so happy to announce that signals do in fact support intersecting train lines so the logic behind this is simple if two train lines are overlapping if their collision boxes are overlapping at all then they are then considered to be part of the same train network and then then the rest of the signal logic just applies from there so this does also mean that like if two train lines are close together but not like intersecting but they're really close and their collisions are overlapping a little they're gonna be considered part of the same train network okay and so that means like the signals are gonna uh treat them as a single block or or however that logic is gonna work and this is still kind of a good thing because trains on two different train lines can still collide with each other the train collisions are not trained network specific or anything like that so in those cases where you have train lines really close together where the trains might collide it is actually a good idea for the train signals to consider those to be part of the same network anyway to avoid collisions so you know just something to keep in mind if you if you want train lines to be separate make sure the train tracks do not collide if you want them to be even if they're parallel if you want to be um considered part of the network you can make them just touch okay so on to some stuff that you guys haven't seen
