> GASP Oh boy! It's actually happening you guys! Drones are here! They're designed for long-range, low resource transport They can't carry many resources at at time But they're doing their best Each port can only contain 1 drone but move
across the map extremely quickly And are far easier to setup than trains, belts, or trucks Drones require batteries as fuel And their consumption rate and travel speed become
more efficient as delivery distances increase Simply put a drone port at 2 separate locations Slap a Drone on 1 - or both, to increase throughput Connect your ports, hook up your batteries And the Drone will fly back and forth delivering
whatever you put in the port
