> uh any thought to allow splitters to be programmed so you can regulate flow via items per minute um i don't know possibly in the future um if it's not too complicated like we always take whenever we make decisions we always try to like to like we want the game to be kind of streamlined so a lot of features that are like too advanced or too like hard to get into we kind of like to avoid i don't think this is necessarily a good example of that because i don't think this is necessarily a super like um advanced feature so to speak but uh it's not it's not a priority right now as that i can say so make sure to post that on the question site that you want this um because we do listen if it's a big deal from community then we'll consider that because there are kind of ways to do that now ish like you can filter you can filter on items and you can use like belts that slow down depending on what you want to do with it like obviously there are certain things you can't do but there are like most of the common things that people want to do there's like a work around in the game right now but it's not impossible it's a long story short it's not impossible
