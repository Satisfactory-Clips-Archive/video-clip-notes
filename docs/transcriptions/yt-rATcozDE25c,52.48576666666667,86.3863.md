> be a feature added to the multiplayer where each player can place a base at the beginning we'd love to compete with a friend to see who can progress to the final tier or in short can we have competitive multiplayer yeah so this question has been asked quite a few times before and the answer is basically no whenever I take this question and I go to the the team and I'm like could we have it so we can make multiple hubs and people can just like compete with each other they very quickly say no yeah then I immediately run away and, so the answer is no and I'm never gonna ask them ever again I'm sorry
