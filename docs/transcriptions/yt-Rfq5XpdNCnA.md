> like if you go to bed you can't expect the factories like run while you're sleeping and then like you wake up and then nothing's happened because it's all been paused pretty much and um we don't like the fact that you can so quote-unquote like cheat your way through through the the progression in that sense uh and also if we were to do the thing where like if we were to implement that that's actually kind of tricky because we would need to like simulate you know every tick rate or every tick for the factories like the production lines and stuff like that which is hard to to like implement so it runs well so like on machines where you barely can run the game like cpu-wise then uh you won't be able to do that that's an issue that sims had with our later games that like it was harder harder to do simulation when people when the sims were sleeping um and food is like it's like survival game territory which isn't really what we wanted the game to be about we didn't want satisfactory to be like a survival uh type game uh we wanted to be a chill factory building game with some aspects like some survival aspects but not like it shouldn't be a big part of the game um so those are two things that we probably will never implement um and i can already hear people going like yeah but what if we just like get rid of the dark and just sleep through it and just like that feels weird too um only five minutes ten percent of the time you play yeah is in the dark it's not not too much but also if the dark is really that much of an issue then the problem is that then maybe it is too dark yeah like the dark time just shouldn't be an issue right so like maybe that's what we need to fix if that's actually uh a problem yeah i can't find the tweet i think but then again like a lot of people told me after we implemented lights that like not as many people were annoyed with the dark anymore maybe we shouldn't face good anymore just like leave it yeah i mean it is supposed to cause some friction with the player yeah yeah exactly so hey nature's got this get rid of the dark bro just use lights there you go bro just use lights i'm gonna put that on the doors
