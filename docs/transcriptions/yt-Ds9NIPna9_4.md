### Transcript

> add planes as vehicles that make you automated to carry resources i don't think so, or like drones or something similar, i don't know i don't think so, personally because it's a it's a pretty complex thing i've talked a lot with, some of the developers on factorio about how they do drones, and they're really expensive in terms of performance and you know it's it's something that if we want to implement that we have to you know take that into consideration, and there's so much else right now that's so expensive in the game so maybe if we can make room for it in the, in the performance budget, then we might be able to do it but then there's also the aspect of like it needs to look good in 3d as well and stuff like that and how would that work and blah blah and not like clip and a lot more so than it's already doing so so like it's not impossible but i personally think it's kind of like maybe not happening we'll see drop if you want to see it happen remember to plop it over on the question site i'll drop a link on it on the, on the steam chat as well so if you have any suggestions make sure to shop drop in on our on our questions site to make it happen but but yeah like there are probably ways we could implement like we could maybe do like a similar situation with like you know the drone to make like like you can't build on top of it right so it would just shoot it straight up and then maybe we'll come down somewhere else and drop off the the the resources and stuff like that like it's not impossible to do some kind of drone i would say, but but we also don't know like would that be cool enough i don't know it would be it would be much cooler if you could like have a drone move around and like pick up a container or something you know and like you could fly with it or something i don't know it would that would be amazing but that feels expensive as i also wouldn't like the game really wouldn't work great with flying right now imo
