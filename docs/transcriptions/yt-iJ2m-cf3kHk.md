> pipe max throughput will probably never be fixed or like fixed quote unquote like we will never increase that because there's an issue with precision uh for pipes we 600 is is like the programmers didn't even want to do it because it causes a few issues uh or theoretically so we'll never go above 600 that that we know for sure belts we haven't investigated that yet if we can go above the uh the current max um what's it called speed throughput um and you know and people always ask this question in relation to like but what about the the minor like the mark three minor if you overclock that then you won't get like i think it's 1200 or something and uh yeah we know we uh we won't like take action on that until we have time to investigate the issue itself because maybe we will introduce faster conveyor belts or we will change like the miner having to like two outputs or something like that uh depending on what we can do but we haven't gotten that point yet so we can't answer that question yet yeah and focus in on other things yes
