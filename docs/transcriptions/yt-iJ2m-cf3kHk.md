> pipe max throughput will probably never be fixed or like fixed quote unquote like we will never increase that because there's an issue with precision, for pipes we 600 is is like the programmers didn't even want to do it because it causes a few issues, or theoretically so we'll never go above 600 that that we know for sure belts we haven't investigated that yet if we can go above the, the current max, what's it called speed throughput, and you know and people always ask this question in relation to like but what about the the minor like the mark three minor if you overclock that then you won't get like I think it's 1200 or something and, yeah we know we, we won't like take action on that until we have time to investigate the issue itself because maybe we will introduce faster conveyor belts or we will change like the miner having to like two outputs or something like that, depending on what we can do but we haven't gotten that point yet so we can't answer that question yet yeah and focus in on other things yes
