### Transcript

> paintball went I kind of regret that we, removed the collar gun because we could have done like a pretty fun minigame we're like you know, what's a are you squid or a kid on nintendo, splatoon yeah could have made a splatoon minigame we're like oh yo that would have been really fun so like the the game is like it's four 2v2 and you have one person with a ceno basher and the other person has the color gun and the same thing on the other team so you have to like like are you gonna go for the the person with the pink gun or you're gonna go like hit the other person with the cena basher and while the two people with the xenobashers are fighting the other two people the other two running around with the color gun are coloring so they're making points to their team and I wish I thought of that before we moved to update fire because now we don't have the color gun anymore so that's a bummer
