### Transcript

> Now Tier 7 is getting a little bit of a makeover, you see Along with some new things Based on feedback, our vision for Tier 8 has changed And because of that we need to
rebalance Tier 7 a smidge To justify that change as we found that
Tier 7 to be a bit too complex Now I know everyone loves complexity But the goal for Tier 7 was to introduce new
and interesting recipes While the goal with Tier 8 is to take that knowledge And challenge you with more complex ones Some of the changes include: Battery production being reworked Bauxite refinement And aluminium production has been rebalanced
to reduce complexity and scale And the amount of refineries! That's right Jace! We've also moved Turbo Motors and
Supercomputers to Tier 8 And we've slightly changed recipes for parts such as: the radio control unit, alclad sheets, batteries, and
iodine infused filters
