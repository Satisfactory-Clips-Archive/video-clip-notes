> but trains suck in multiplayer dedicated servers when so this is the kind of like mindset that's kind of weird right so like this is people think dedicated servers are going to do like everything for you trains don't suck in multiplayer because there aren't dedicated servers trains suck in multiplayer because there's bugs in the code yeah right like we we could give you a dedicated server right now the trains would still suck in it the problem is that we didn't fix the problem right right so like we just need to fix the bugs you're gonna be really disappointed when we do release dedicated service and you notice that like if we don't why does it do everything for you because it won't solve that issue you're still gonna get latency issues, and stuff like that adding dedicated servers is just gonna introduce more bugs because now we have another system yeah another system to build for another system to support you know more another place another point of failure all right so like you know of course we'll like try and make it as good as possible and fix it up and make it as stable as possible but like when something's just not working it's just because it's not working yeah it's netcode that needs to be worked on not dedicated servers yep but but both right dedicated service is its own feature but like a lot of the limitations that people are running into are not because it's not dedicated servers some maybe but for the most part the bugs are just bugs unless you have like a kind of like if you're playing on your laptop and you're hosting on that and you know like it barely hold its own and sure then that makes a big, that's that makes a difference but most of the bugs in the game are not due to that it's due to please keep the bugs there are some there are some bugs that are no good speed fragger that are no good
