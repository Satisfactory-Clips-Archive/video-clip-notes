> because, it's gonna be it's gonna be a cool one I've been looking forward to this so, it's me again snoot I don't know if you noticed but we're back to our old times time schedule time thing back at 4 pm cest, super stoked for that because it gives me one more hour to prepare for this which is great I need that, so yeah my tag is like all buffed up what's that what happened with that this this won't stand I have to fix this wait I actually have to fix this this is annoying me why are you all over there buddy should be over here wait did I fix it I think it did it's fine all right did you murder jace yes jace is dead jace is, is, he's not joining us today either next week though oh boy it's going to be a duty fired yes jace was fired but we'll probably rehire him again at some point we'll see no promises, so yeah cool welcome to, yet another weekly dev stream if you haven't been here before I'm sorry that you tuned in, it won't get any better than this I promise so you know you already get it's free all right so you get what you what you paid for okay, but, yeah welcome to our weekly live stream where we talk about the game we, do deep dives on certain topics with the game sometimes which is going to be the case today because today we're going to be talking a lot about the spire coast we have hannah our level designer is going to be joining us and, showcase some things we're going to be talking about the in the conception of the spire coast but also answer some questions that you guys have had since we dropped a video last week about the spire coast how about that huh a lot of a lot of info be dropped on ye, well yeah if you didn't know we dropped the video last week I dropped a video last week about the spider coast, showing a few more shots from the spire coast, and talked about like the implications of the spire coasts if you will like, you know like what are the implications of us changing that area if you have any factories in that area I still recommend people moving out because the environment is going to change quite drastically etc etc I don't I won't talk too much about that video because we're going to be you know sort of giving you all that information anyways in a in a while when hannah joins, so if you haven't watched that video like don't sweat it because if you're if you hang out for the stream for a bit, when hannah joins in here there's no time schedule here but at least you get somewhat of agenda, we're going to be talking more about it and we're going to be talking more, more about some things that people have asked wondered since we launched that video and yeah show you a bit more from the sparkles actually so, look forward to that look forward to that, another couple of things I want to talk about is that we was it last week I think it was the week before actually time time moves fast, we made an update to we patched the, early access version of the game and introduced some bug fixes but also apparently introduced some bugs who would have thought so I just want to say that we are planning to release another patch sometime in the near future I don't know exactly when that will happen the most prominent thing that we want to address is one bug that was introduced with the train signaling system and to us it wasn't like anticipated because okay so the bug was that it was actually a couple of bugs but but most of these bugs were related to modding so hopefully the modern community have been fixing these kind of issues that some people folks have had with some mods not loading and some mods actually breaking some of the the signal systems in the game but one issue that we actually noticed and we are actually planning to fix that is if you placed a train station within two path signals it caused some issues and that was surprising to us because that's not like intended behavior really that you're supposed to be able to do that so we were more surprised that you were able to do it before if anything the the idea is that you want to use block signals for, blocking out the train stations because train stations are like considered stops so using past signals have like a train station with impact signals is kind of like weird I in our opinion but we're gonna like address that in some way I don't know how we we saw that if we just give you more information or like or actually fix it so you can have strategies with impact signals I don't quite remember but, but just so you guys know that is something that we are going to address in the next couple of patches that's coming so, so yeah cool all right I think that's that's, going to be the shortest like state of dev actually, if anything anything else interesting going on how are you guys doing you guys using trains yeah trains are cool right,
>
> [Laughter]
>
> all right it's all over dave yeah yeah yeah for sure for sure, is anybody reworking their factories for spider coasts or is everyone just like leaving it for fate chains are too hard for me trains are actually kind of tricky yeah just gonna look up some good tutorial and I'm pretty sure like most people can get it like if you don't make too complex like setups most cases you just need to use like just you just need to remember like you use path signals to go in into an intersection and use block signals going out of it and so long as you you know that you can get away with a lot of stuff crossing my fingers that my old rig survives I'm sure it's fine, yeah if you guys didn't see the video the, if you have like old rigs placed in the environment and you load up update six later on the line I don't think that will actually break because the way we've made it is that like miners don't actually check if there's an oil node underneath them not sorry miners extractors like they don't actually check if there's oil notes beneath them they just know that like I'm hooked up to this node, at least that's how the system used to work it may change but I'm pretty fairly certain that's still the case, some people think that they can cheat the system and be like yeah but if I don't remove them and then when the off date drops, I'll I'll be able to have more nodes in that area, the extractors are still tied to the node so if you try to place extractors on the nodes once we move them they're gonna be like you can't place that there there's already an extractor on it so, so yeah calling out total no total total got that information I feel like pretty sure you put it in the video that's not gonna be the case, but I saw a lot of other people, yeah exactly I took that back, there was an edit in the video guys come on but I saw a couple of other people on the reddit and stuff like that be like hey big brain move coming so if you're like not wanting to move your factory because of this aspect that like you can get more out of it you're not gonna get more out of it you're just gonna get more work not being able to dismantle stuff because stuff is gonna cramp into the environment so, yes nothing is more permanent than a temporary solution that is so true so, so yeah more oil for us not more oil different oil yeah save it into the last year the save editor is going to have to work overtime for this next update that's just the way it is, always I guess every update, so yeah cool I don't think there's anything else I don't think we have an update on merch status this week, I guess one pretty cool thing I could address or not address like point out too, I don't know if you guys have kept up but there's, you know within the coffee stain family there's a bunch of different studios you know we have we have comfortable studios we have coffee north and we have lava potion in gothenburg, today is actually a very special day because lava potion are releasing songs of conquest today and a couple of hours actually so whoop pretty cool, this game has been in development for a long time and very excited very exciting, I haven't played it so I don't know how how it plays but I'm pretty sure it's like a what's it called here's a mighty magic kind of inspired game, it's really cool it's like pixel art two and a half d, fancy yeah magic like exactly yeah it's like a mix of heroes imagine magic and magic,
>
> [Music]

> so yeah really really cool post link, I can check if I can find one how is my google foo you guys aren't allowed to post links you're not cool enough, yeah releases in one hour apparently approximately one hour I think it releases at six so, pretty much as like the second the stream is over you guys you should you should definitely check it out you know what I mean, so yeah really cool really cool super happy for them, they've been working really hard on it and it's been in development for I kind of want to say like as long as satisfactory for as long as satisfactory, because I can't remember a time when I worked at kofizang when I didn't know they were working on this game so it's it's a pretty pretty 18 year years older than I am, so yeah they're also a stream I don't think they have a stream they post on youtube but, I don't know maybe they do stream we can check we can check it once the stream is over see what happens, but yeah without further ado, because a lot of stuff when I usually talk about state-of-the-art I usually talk about the last thing that we did and that was the the spire coast video, I feel like I'm gonna be rehashing a lot of information if I do that we'd rather do that during the segment with hannah so I'm just going to jump into community highlights and then have hannah join in and then we'll talk about the spider coast
