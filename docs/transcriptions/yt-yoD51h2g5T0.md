### Transcript

> yeah is there an actual date for the official release of the game don't think so no we don't even fully know what year we think their final release will be on honestly i know that we say on the steam page that like we think it's gonna come out in 2022 but i mean yeah anything can happen we'll see if that happens we don't really want to be bound by that too much no like we don't want to say we don't want to say 2022 and then everyone's going to be like but you said 2022 and then we start rushing and we're going gonna be like uh look it's done guys but it's like not done and it's like yeah honestly that that one was a little bit of a bummer because i think when we were launched on steam you had to say a date for 1.0 or something like that uh or like anything sort of and we already knew at that point like we probably don't know we're just guessing at this point because you know the game is done when it's done but at the same time it's not like we're gonna stay in early access for forever we have we have the intent to finish the game and that's really what we're working towards that's sort of why we have the release cycle that we have right now with you know us moving on to the next thing because we are we have our eyes set on 1.0 um so uh yeah we'll see
