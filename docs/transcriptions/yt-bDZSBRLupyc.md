> if there's a crash and I submit the bug report from that is there any benefit to also posting on the QA site I think is what you're saying, yep I think there is I think you should do it as well because then it will go to different people so the when the game crashes and you send a report this goes to a kind of database that we have that keeps track of like different bugs that are reported and it Aggregates them, and and then we can sort of see like, how frequent certain crashes are happening, and you know that can Aid Us in prioritizing what's what's happening or or you know when we get a massive influx of one new specific kind of bug we're like oh we've introduced an issue and we can sort of fix that so that's helpful there but the the QA side is also helpful as well because it also gets it in front of other people's eyes, here at the studio who checked the QA site, it also gives you the opportunity to provide more detail including any images or pictures and things like that, images and pictures by the way, or like log files that you want to submit or anything right, so I would say there's a benefit of doing it but it's up to you if you feel like you don't want to do it I mean it's your life, different replications with the same issue that people post on Qi site is helpful also true yeah letting us know how you get the bug to occur is really helpful
