### Transcript

> because I want to I kind of also want to talk about the atmosphere maybe I can just actually we don't need to be on the surface because I wanted to touch on the atmosphere system that we've made and change this way because the the one thing that a lot of people noticed when we, updated the game for, from to update five was that the like sky got super like desaturated and gray, but now somebody somebody who can actually just round oh you're not going to lean over the entire time now if you look up yeah like it's it's it's a lot it's a lot cleaner now and nicer so and we completely changed like the way that clouds are generated the clouds are generated now I think before they were just, they they are volumetric I love it so it's an, complex theater taking care of it yeah we have a fallback for low spec computers that are just using an umap instead so if your gpu is really old don't worry you should be able to have at least some clouds that look decent that are based off the cloud so they're just a static render of it, all right we can actually go back to that because is it is it a bit bummer if you go to the server manager I'm going to there, because we're in a dune desert right now and it doesn't rain in the desert under the rain stuff yeah so how does the rain work right now like I mentioned it doesn't rain in the dune desert or any other places oh no oh oh nice she shouldn't have said it I'm about to start reading the calls back oh I gotta go debug this can you also, make sure that the, make sure that it's on desktop one which yeah it is because we're using windows 11 isn't it yeah it's certainly not satisfactory yeah so it doesn't rain in the dune desert does it rain in rocky desert yes okay green's everywhere but there okay so it's only doing desert yeah there's also quite a slim chance to get rain so okay but I'll be here for a while yeah yeah for sure, did we ever get around to adding like so you can turn it
