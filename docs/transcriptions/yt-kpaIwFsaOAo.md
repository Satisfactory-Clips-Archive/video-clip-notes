### Transcript

> know, fixmas we don't have any news on fixmas, fixmas is gonna be like, if we have time sort of thing sort of deal, I think it'll I don't wanna speak too soon here but I think we will have some time but maybe not I don't know it's it's kind of like we need like a couple of weeks beforehand to like even know what we're gonna do so and I feel like you know since we're still waiting for update five to be done maybe people are still kind of like you know waiting for that so fixmas I don't know maybe we'll make it maybe don't I don't know we'll kind of see it'll be a fun surprise right because it's it's we don't have a lot of time, so yeah that's just to say to that yeah fixtures is fun it's just, you know everything else is coming at the same time like it's it's, even if we wanted to if if you don't have time then we can't do it you know that's just the nature of development, we're not gonna like throw ourselves at it just so we can do it you know we kind of want to like work on the game and not have to stress about everything that's going on like if we if we meet a window of of something then obviously we'll do it but, yeah last last year we actually had to spend like you know quite a significant time before fixmas to be able to do it so I think we spent like two months before fixmas to work on that stuff and I don't know what the state of that is right now so I mean if we haven't started a month ago then it probably won't happen but, yeah it's just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes update 5 turnout to be a much bigger like release than we anticipated I think, so it's kind of like screwing a little bit with our schedule but I think I think everybody would prefer us doing it this way like you'd prefer having update 5 out than you know doing it any other way so maybe we can can we just delay fixmas actually can we release fixes like in january that'd be a thing, so yeah anyway
