### Transcript

> in the world now of course if the trains derail you need to repair them somehow and we've seen a lot of like uh pretty interesting speculations of how this works and people thinking like oh i'm gonna be dropping all this stuff on the ground maybe i need storage containers to put them in rebuilding the trains like what's gonna happen with nuclear waste there's gonna be waste everywhere all these like interesting kind of ideas um so that was really cool to see we love we love we love seeing this kind of speculation among amongst the community it's one of the reasons why we leave a week before we we actually give information um and i i don't know i get the feeling that people like doing this stuff too like i think you guys like getting engaged in that way too it's really fun i find it really fun but uh yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna burst the bubbles gonna show you how the sausage is made so re-railing your trains after they have derailed is actually quite simple you simply just walk up to one of the carts that's you know derailed uh it could be the locomotive it could be one of the freight cargo uh carriage things or one of the containers and uh when you go up to it you have the option to uh press e to re-rail the car you just press e on it and it immediately just pops back to where it had derailed before so this this makes the process incredibly easy we don't really want this to be tedious because we don't really want to punish you too much uh for making a mistake with your signals it's it's likely that when people are learning signals that there's gonna be a lot of trial and error we don't wanna make repairing trains to be a real pain in the butt every time there's a there's a crash right so it's actually really easy to do but this does sort of beg the question what happens if you have a train line over a ravine and everything falls off the train line and you can't get to the carts anymore well we have a sort of uh backup plan now we don't actually have i can't show you this right now because it's not in the game yet but we will have it for update five there'll be a hologram there that you can interact with and here's sort of like a mock-up of that um yeah this is this is not how it's actually gonna look in the game this is just just an internal screenshot that we've shared around um that mark made for you know a concept of how this hologram could look and yeah so we do intend to have that in for update five before that comes out and yeah so you'll have basically two ways to repair your trains either directly by interacting with one of the carts or by interacting with a hologram where the crash uh occurred so that's train collisions they're a thing
