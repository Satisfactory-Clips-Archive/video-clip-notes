> console is a question that i get a lot, console is something that we would like to have in the future but we're focusing on pc right now yeah console is like such a daunting thing to think of it's it's not easy it's like it is not simple or straightforward to be like updating pcs, and or mac linux and consoles or something like that yeah, it's that's incredibly difficult and at a time where i mean look how long it's taking us to get an update out right like like we're working our asses off to get gameplay and content out, we don't want a significant chunk of that time going to, putting it on a console where, sure more people get to play it but nothing new is added to that to the game in that sense like we just want to finish the game right that's the that's what we're charging full steam ahead to what did i say can we get a what's the count of micro transactions by the way what are we up there we got one more yeah i wonder if they remember yeah, i was gonna say something about that, so yeah like i've done it now 27., but yeah like i even then like we have to solve like a different set of optimization issues for console because like you have to optimize kind of specially or like in somewhat it's not totally true but like you have to like there are other rendering issues on console and they're on a pc and it's also like different rendering issues on like playstation and on xbox because they use different rendering apis and then we'd have to manage like, controlled support and yeah we want control support but again that's like this, quote-unquote distraction like i know it feels bad to say when there are people who want to use controllers but when the game keeps evolving and changing that's one of the reasons we stopped doing control support it's like the controller mappings just kept changing because we kept adding and changing functionality so it's like we'll just wait till the game is settled and then we'll look into it
