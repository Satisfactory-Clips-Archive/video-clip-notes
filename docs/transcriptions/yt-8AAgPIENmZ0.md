### Transcript

> any place for player generated map i don't think there are any plans for that right now but we'll have to see what happens when we start working more with mod support um maybe maybe that's a thing that can be done so that uh modders can change up the map but right now i don't think there's any plan yeah it's kind of tricky with the map because like a lot of the map is baked so it's kind of hard to change it you'd have to like unload an entire tile and then reload like your version of it with the chain like if you want to make like a slight change to a tile or something you'd have to remove like the entire thing essentially uh it's kind of tricky with that stuff but we'll see if we can figure something out
