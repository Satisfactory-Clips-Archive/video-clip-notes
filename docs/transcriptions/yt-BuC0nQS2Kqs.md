> stuff like that, confused on the use of controllers you said that they're not supported but I've been using one since they, since early access launch should I expect my use of controller to change, so it's really weird that that's the case because we've, pretty sure we spent literally no time on making that work, we well we did way back when and then just stop supporting it completely the fact that it works I think is a mere coincidence as for whether it will change in the future I think mappings and things like that might change who knows since it seems to be working by magic anyway, but, yeah unless I don't think we're gonna remove it like I don't think we're gonna be like delete the support, you know actively go and do that so hopefully it will just keep working for you hopefully we did talk a while back with steam controllers that they were like we had our initial like controller setup that we've we kind of like quite quite abandoned when we were working on because it was so hard to maintain it, but there has been control support like at some point during development and then yep it was too much yeah like you just said, and then when we were launched on steam there was some issue with like steam controllers not like you could because you can like remap, on steam in some manner I'm not quite sure how it works yeah yeah you can, and I remember there was some discussion that like if we remove the current controller support then it would be easier to do that remapping or something but maybe we didn't need to or something I don't quite remember but if it works then cool, yeah I don't know I don't know how it works I don't know why yeah I also don't like because like some things I don't know if you can do on controller like you can't do mass dismantle I think a controller and stuff like that so
