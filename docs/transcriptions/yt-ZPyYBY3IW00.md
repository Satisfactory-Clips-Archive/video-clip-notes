### Transcript

> what about river physics textures any updates on that anytime soon they're kind of empty without water interaction right now, I don't know when the, river updates are coming I know that they're they've been done, yeah this there's like two branches to how we update the world like the the people are working on like the world stuff they live in their own bubble and then the people that are working on the update stuff they work in their own world at some point we're gonna collide those two, when it makes sense because it's also annoying if we continually update the world every single update because it's gonna like spawn a bunch of weird stuff, around the world, so I don't yeah at some point there's going to be an update too to the world and that's when all those rivers and all that jazz will come in
