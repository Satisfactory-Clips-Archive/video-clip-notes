> and, let's just move on with the show so I have I have like one thing I want to bring up today, that's I guess kind of like important, and that is a question that we've been getting a lot I've been getting a lot of questions by the way you guys from from everyone in the community I haven't been able to answer everyone because I've been I've been taking a few days off between now and and update four this is my first day back and I just haven't had the chance to get around to everyone but I do see you and one question that I've been getting a lot is when the update 4 will reach ea early access and we are hoping for update ford hit early access on april 13th, which is in what is it two weeks three weeks to three weeks so three weeks from now we're hoping that the, update 4 will reach early access, now I with any date that we give out obviously, anything can happen we can still delay this, but everything's looking good so far, there hasn't been like there's been a bunch of crashes and stuff and that always happens, but like I said before this has been one of our most stable releases we've ever done so we feel pretty good about it honestly, but anything can happen so take that date with a grain of salt, obviously like the weeks leading up to it will be like like yes 100 april 13th but that's what we're looking for right now
