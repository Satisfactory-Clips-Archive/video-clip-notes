> to the iron or picking up iron ore coming back making ingots making place I now have 20 five iron plates so what I could do is I can go back to the Trading Post here and grab these put them in the ship and in seven minutes our ship will ship off and deliver the plates and we'll get the schematics back okay so what we do now for for seven minutes well we can pick up more iron ore I guess or we could it would be better if we could automate that because it's really tedious right it's it's slow and it's annoying to play that minigame all the time so if we hit beter from the build mint build menu again and go to production we have the schematics for a miner already now what I can do is I can shift left click on miner and what that has done is that has added a list on the top left so I can see what I need to build one and if I shift left right click on it it goes away so if I do that now I see what I need to make a miner I can spend my time doing that for now so I can play some minor on this iron ore here and maybe another miner here then I'll be getting a lot more I know that I can do by myself all right so I've made all the iron rods and iron plates that I need as we can see up here in the top left corner but I still need wire so zero to 12 wire what do we need for wire so we there's wire here in the work bench that requires copper ingots copper ingots require copper ore and if we remember copper ore was over here so this is this is reasonably tedious right now which is why we want to build this Factory things will become automated and very very efficient later okay so pick up some copper ore all right let's do this okay so picked up a bunch of copper ore and I ran back and I turned it into wire okay great we can see that we now have all the requirements all the resources we need in order to build a miner so I'll Cove it through the iron ore deposit here I'll press B make form in the production menu click on miner as you can see miners no longer red or anything and when I sort of mouse over that it goes goes blue obviously I can't build a miner here it's red yeah and then if I use the mouse wheel I can rotate the miner so that it faces the direction that I like and I like this direction so click and now we have a miner yay okay now that we've made it what I might now that we've made it what I might do is I might consider getting rid of this short the the text on the top left salt shift right click on a miner and the text up here goes away okay so now we should have all the ore we ever need right there's nothing here it's open this I just press to eat but it says it needs power okay sir now we need power how do we get power well if we press the build menu there's a palette that conveniently enough and there's a biomass burner here but that requires 59 place 15 iron rods and 20 wires so I'm gonna shift left click that again so I see what I need and before we can automate things I'm gonna go and pick all this stuff up manually all over again
