### Transcript

> make the walls know Collide on each other, so the main reason why they don't do that at the moment is you could end up with a lot of cases where we try to stop you not like clipping walls into like this exact same place and and if we don't do that then there's a lot of like unnecessary clipping happening for walls, that's the main reason but there's also like cases where if they go like this they'll also get blocked by that and that's a bit unfortunate but, there there really is an issue where if you have like one wall here and you're zooping from this side I guess you could do that though like it it'll interject that's bad that causes a lot of unnecessary clipping where you don't even see it happening that's why we have that in place
