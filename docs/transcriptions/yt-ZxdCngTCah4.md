> can we please make programmable splitter ratio outputs depending on frequency of it on each output direction i mean a lot of people have requested changes or updates or improvements or enhancements whatever uh splitters yeah the best place to to request that stuff is the keyway psych game that's that's where uh we will uh take your uh up your feedback on that once we we delve into that stuff so the more that more people that about that i i really encourage that because i really want that to be a feature um yeah it sounds really good like so so the thing is like you know with some of these features like like that is if you're gonna change that like if we were to add that one specific feature right onto programmable splitters the thing that makes sense is well first of all any change you make in a game has a knock-on effect to everything else that has anything to do with it right so if we're gonna if we're gonna make that one change there may be knock-on effects to other things yeah and so if we're gonna do that we should just do some sort of potentially some sort of overhaul or a lot of changes in one go so that everything is balanced and everything makes sense so you know like i i can't say to you yeah sure we'll do that you know your request right but if if we have them on the qa site uh people who make those decisions will get a better idea of what people want and they'll take that into consideration when they do end up working on this hole so when we sit down with splitters and mergers again uh when we revisit it we'll look at what people want and then we'll see what we want and what makes sense and then we'll do it all in one go then whenever that might be yeah sounds like a plan jace let's do it y'all that's the approach with pretty much everything by the way so yeah
