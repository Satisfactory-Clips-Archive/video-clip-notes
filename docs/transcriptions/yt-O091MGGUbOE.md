> but yeah I had a pretty pretty sweet vacation, do you want to see some pictures chase so we're streaming so I went to tv show you could show me later maybe no all right all right okay well I'll be here it's great so so I went to t viden which is like a natural reserve or whatever it's called, in sweden it's like one hour from puebla and, is this a stock photo this is this is not a stock are you using this with permission I'm using this for permission for myself so so look how happy I am oh my god I don't have to be here I walk out in the woods got lost it's great that's that's the look of someone who's lost right there guess I'm lost oh well I'll embrace it I'm like [ __ ] yeah finally guess I'll be lost then yeah but it was awesome I did a lot of hiking, running around, and I've been writing a lot of one wheel, which is like a little kind of skateboard sort of that's like on one wheel it's pretty fun it's only got one wheel yeah science has gone too far yeah this is really funny on that thing what was that can you do shove it's on that thing no it dude it weighs like 25 kilos or something like that oh really you can't really do anything with it but that's not the only thing I did I [ __ ] like you know there had this like this thing going on I was like [ __ ] that [ __ ] I'm gonna go vacationing like I'm gonna go go places so I went to the beach beaches of, alaska oh yes I can see that you you you certainly did go there oh yeah sleeping margaritas on the beach you know just couldn't yep couldn't stop myself but I was like well I was the last guy I was like I just I gotta go like I can't just go to the last guy do they have wow so I went to the grand canyon as well oh I see that you were wearing your anti-shadow costume cloaking device yeah yeah yeah it's it's it's very good yes it's merged for satisfactory you know oh yes very good I also went to pisa like check it out yeah dude not crowded at all there no no tower's a lot smaller than you think like you know all those fixtures but like people like pushing the tower yeah they're doing this weird thing yeah yeah I always thought that was a perspective thing that that's actually yeah no I went there we actually went there like entire coffee stand went there once and we all gave it a little little squish squish like like squish it like a little pimple yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I see that you also I also went to machu picchu, you did that was pretty sweet wow oh your ability to maintain the exact same, pose wherever you go is is I've always been impressed by that I also had a tree branch stuck in my neck the entire time yeah while I was traveling oh good god it's just it's just easier to keep it there right because you could it's just something else is going to get stuck there otherwise I mean might as well just keep like you know how like flies like you just you just get used to it at some point just get used to it yeah yeah I also did a quick step in at thai my shop taj mahal that's the one yep didn't spend much time learning the pronunciation of the the the place I see but, a lot of time taking pictures no doubt oh- I yeah I took one picture and then immediately went to giza oh you I'm all up there the framing didn't quite work out in this picture but, you know I was there apparently that's much smaller than we thought as well I mean either ethan you're much taller than the, the local egyptians look at this tiny people it's also it's also perspective thing because like it's it's way bigger at the bottom and then the higher up you get the smaller it gets so it's like a little bit of like a illusion oh is it one of those things that if we drew a line at your legs and dragged it down to the bottom it would actually match the same title yeah in fact this is how they filmed lord of the rings they went to giza and he had frode in the background I believe that's like some forced perspective or something I believe it's called in the, in the industry classic I also hang out with one of my best friends that I haven't seen in a while, his name is his name is tim tim the tick tim all right you were there with him yeah we, someone someone took a screenshot very similar to this maybe have been of tim shortly before or after you were there I think you're thinking of me actually because I this one is on a timer and then I went back and I took the pic oh maybe that was you on your smurf account yeah you submitted on your reddit yeah and to top it all off I also and this is this is a bit secret okay nobody knows this but okay also went to update five okay like I took a little tour in update five do you wanna do you wanna see a little bit from updates I mean I don't know if it's been approved have have we gotten the okay from you guys wanna see a little teaser
