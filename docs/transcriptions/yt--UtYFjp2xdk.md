> so just to see what one can do with this game and streaming it modded personally yeah yeah I mean community blows my mind all the time like I still remember the first like couple weeks that we, that the closed alpha was over over where people could start sharing the stuff that they've done online and simply someone getting a panning shot by standing on a conveyor belt blew our minds we were like wow community or genius how did they think of that wow we never even thought of that you know and the shots were really good but you know it was just standing on a conveyor belt but like I remember like like honestly I might have been more surprised at that at that time or equally surprised at that at that time compared to what I see here because like at that time we did we had no idea anyone would even play the game honestly and then like or if they would do anything sort of interesting with it you know it's kind of weird, but now we know that actually people are really really talented and, creative, okay so so in a way part of me is like a little bit prepared for this kind of crazy stuff now you know but like I was never expecting this what's this yeah we could I was never expecting anything of this this level at all I mean I'm still surprised honestly oh boy okay
