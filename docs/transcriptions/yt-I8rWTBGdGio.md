### Transcript

> if the community made a snow biome would you add that bottom right corner of the manuscript, well no because we wouldn't be able to add it to the game because of the way mods are like made you'd have to have like the mod loader and all that jazz, but if the mod makers make a snow biome as a mod I will definitely highlight it on stream and I like sing it to the praise of the world so that everybody knows there's a snow biomod for sure
