> factory moves to ue5 a lot of people are going to be asking about this I don't see it moving to ue5 anytime soon, there's certainly no plans at this stage the the task to move from so when we we recently updated the engine right, a few months ago and that that took a long time for us to do and then it took a long long time for us to stabilize it changing from four to five is gonna be huge as well because we've also modified the engine so so upgrading engine is really really not trivial it's it's actually not that trivial to begin with, and then if you've, edited the engine, it makes it even harder now the other the other thing is a lot of people have seen like things like night and all the or whatever the new features are that come with unreal engine 5 which apparently give you infinite you know, optimization, you know like performance and things like that, changing to the engine doesn't just give you that right like if we got satisfactory if we just got it running on early engine 5 we wouldn't get any of that like we pretty much wouldn't get any of that for free you you have to just like you have to build your game with that in mind, so so there's a like if we were to move to ue5 and wanted to get those benefits it's almost like we would have to we would have to rebuild a large chunk of the game for that to make sense but you know it might be a thing that we do eventually but it's and unreal engine five is like in early access I think right like we're not gonna we're not gonna move to an early access engine right now that's not a good idea so yeah it's not going to happen anytime soon
