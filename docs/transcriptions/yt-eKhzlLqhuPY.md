> hey Jace why does the game this is a quick interesting question why does the game have to stutter when the autosave kicks in so the reason it needs to stutter is because it needs to take a copy of the current game State when it saves and the game cannot advance from that game from that copy or while the copy is happening happening, or or else or else the save won't save correctly it will it will like say part of the game which was in one state and then another part of the game in another state and then when you load it you're not going to load the game as it is which can cause really really major issues and so the game needs to stop, in order to take it into account and the reason the stutter can be so big is because people can build a lot of things and there's a lot of things that are happening a lot of things need to be saved, and that's why there's the stutter, 12 second game save that's pretty good you know sometimes people get frustrated right I know I have with my, with my auto save I'm like oh I'm doing something but but if the auto save is kicked in and I can't play now this is annoying but you know what you reframe it you you thank the autosave because imagine if the autosave wasn't there oh man how many times has autosave save saved your ass and you and you just get mad at it that's not fair to auto save John praise the autosave you should thank the autosave this gaming therapy it is you should thank the autosave it's helping you it's helping poor autosave China exactly got killed three times for my honestly [ __ ] auto save disable it now oh God very good, auto save charm what's what's the hair color it's pink I want to say prevents my safe scum Tendencies let me be a better human see it's helping accidentally closed down my game by accidentally moving my hands to press the wrong button combination just a few seconds after an auto save C thanks auto save helps a lot
