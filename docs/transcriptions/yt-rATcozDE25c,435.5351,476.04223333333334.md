> achievements yeah there's going to be achievements i'm pretty sure there's going to be achievements but it's not something that we're thinking about right now i mean they're they're awesome to have i'm not sure if epic has achievements yet but i'm pretty sure they're if they don't have it yet it's going to be on the road map and we also don't want to create achievements until the game is done or balanced in some reasonable way like if we had achievements now on production or something like that or something about the map or how many mercy spheres you've collected and that changes over time then like what happens with the achievement we kind of can't get rid of it so we just they're cool they're cool to have but they're not like necessary so we'll just leave them let's put put them aside for now can we use turbo fuel in jetpacks
