> gonna just just get just get the show go go hey everyone my name is jason i'm a community manager at coffee stain studios today we're gonna be doing a q a video haven't done that in a while every week on our streams uh tuesday at 4 p.m cet or cest we always have a q a section where a lot of people ask questions and it's nice to answer the questions there but we only have a few hundred people there but we have a lot like tens of thousands of people here on youtube and i haven't done q and a's for you guys so we've put out you know the call outs on twitter and facebook and uh yeah on youtube actually just for you guys to give out some questions and i'll answer them i'll answer them today in this video we got a lot so maybe we can get through it all depending on editing time or if some of them are garbage or not all right so uh first question will it be a feature added to the multiplayer where each player can place a base at the beginning we'd love to compete with a friend to see who can progress to the final tier or in short can we have competitive multiplayer yeah so this question has been asked quite a few times before and the answer is basically no whenever i take this question and i go to the the team and i'm like could we have it so we can make multiple hubs and people can just like compete with each other they very quickly say no yeah then i immediately run away and uh so the answer is no and i'm never gonna ask them ever again i'm sorry are there any plans beyond 1.0 do you see it as a completed game or will there be some minor maintenance in short what are we are we going to maintain the game after 1.0 i think we are i'm sure there's going to be bug fixes and maybe some tweaks and you know we've talked about like could we do some bigger like dlcs or something just keep in mind that when we work really hard on big dlcs or if anyone any company works really hard on dlcs that cost the company money right so sometimes they they package things in dlc so we've thought about like is that what we want to do do we just want to do free updates we'll kind of see but i don't think we're just gonna just gonna drop it at 1.0 and just be like okay bye we're gonna work on a new game now like i don't know like good simulator 2 or or sanctum 3 like we're not just gonna ditch satisfactory right away uh or that is the plan as it is how are you dead inside next question do you have a timeline on when you want to start implementing lore is it on the near horizon yeah we do have a timeline for lore and i'm not sure when we're gonna start implementing it internally but it isn't gonna come out until 1.0 so that is that plan so when the game is completed and it drops you'll also get the entire story instead of like pieces of it over time uh so that's how that's gonna work out and when 1.0 is no one knows we have an idea but we're always wrong i understand that there might not be a release on console anytime soon but is there any possibility that it might come to ps4 and xbox yeah so obviously a question asked many times and and as you say there you've uh you know that we've said that it's not going to come any time soon there's a decent chance that it might come to the consoles or even other platforms like mac and linux even though linux can kind of be supported anyway but it would be it would definitely be cool uh there's just a few limitations or questions or things that need to sort of be answered on as for how we would do it and it may be that it's not gonna happen until like after 1.0 i imagine no one's told me this but i kind of think so because making a bunch of changes to the game to to be supported on console is a lot of work and doesn't actually add to the game um and let me just explain this you know we want to know what features we want to make and we want to know what balancing we need and you know we need to get story and we need to fix bugs and all of that stuff and that's very hard and takes a lot of our time but if we were to also do consoles that's going to take a lot of time from input from just it working at all and then there's certification processes it takes a really long time and if we're dedicating a lot of resources to console then that means we aren't dedicating a lot of resources to bug fixes to features to finishing the game so i don't think that's going to happen before 1.0 but after that it's absolutely a possibility there's no decision on that and you say ps4 and xbox but of course it might be ps5 or xbox one series x2 105.9 i don't play xbox i don't use it i'm a ps police station boy fanboy are there any hidden parts of the map you think that people haven't found if so can you give us a clue as to where they might be yeah there's i don't know if there are hidden parts but there's some hidden like little easter eggs and i know of one i won't say what it is there are quite a few things but there is one i asked hannah and it is in she thinks it's in a cave in the in the grass fields so you can go to the grass fields and look around for a cave she actually didn't place it so she's not 100 sure it was uh either the director or the previous director so uh but that's a clue check it out maybe you'll find it it should be pretty obvious when you see it it sticks out pretty that wasn't a hint not the sticks out but it's it's pretty obvious when you see it how many likes on this youtube video for jace to get fired one like can we get more survival features added in a special mode for those of us who want a little more of a challenge it's an itch i feel nobody has been willing to scratching gaming this is um something that has been requested quite a bunch we see it pretty common commonly um pretty often rather and the answer there is no i'm pretty sure it's a hard note and that's not going to change we don't think that that's part of the game it's not the focus of the game at all the main focus of the game is building the factories and etc and that is that is a lot of the game and so so one thing we think of there is when we add official mod support maybe that's something that could be created there is unofficial mod support and maybe someone will make that there but i'm pretty sure we're not going to be dedicating any time for survival aspects of the game i see satisfactory as the illegitimate love child of no man's sky in factorio however what would you say was your inspiration of making satisfactory i actually haven't heard of either of those games it's just an original idea that we came up with someone just brainstormed it out and uh here we are will there be a one-to-one lizard doggo plushie probably not but that would be cool or like a statue or something that would be cool figurine or even better a real one we can just engineer one we'll get on to that right now we won't do consoles but we will dedicate resources to engineering and lizard dogger will there be any environmental influences later like climate change or heat wave storms and so on this is something that we actually always imagined to be in the game from the very beginning although many of those things did not turn out like turrets for example which aren't happening and and there were even prototypes of like tornadoes and i think earthquakes is why i think it was earthquakes uh but as for now they've been cut there's a chance that they'll come back i think things like pollution has been something that has been uh both requested and also brainstormed within the company i can't give you a straight answer there but uh i i think there's i think there's a chance honestly i think there's a chance what is the story with the mercy sphere that would be related to the story uh can't say anything will there be achievements yeah there's going to be achievements i'm pretty sure there's going to be achievements but it's not something that we're thinking about right now i mean they're they're awesome to have i'm not sure if epic has achievements yet but i'm pretty sure they're if they don't have it yet it's going to be on the road map and we also don't want to create achievements until the game is done or balanced in some reasonable way like if we had achievements now on production or something like that or something about the map or how many mercy spheres you've collected and that changes over time then like what happens with the achievement we kind of can't get rid of it so we just they're cool they're cool to have but they're not like necessary so we'll just leave them let's put put them aside for now can we use turbo fuel in jetpacks yeah probably i think that's something that we're gonna add uh we just asked the director before and he thinks it's gonna happen however the the limitation here is actually a technical one i think we would have had them by now if we had already solved a problem that we have so uh you know judging by that answer it sounds like we're gonna have it just when we get around to solving that technical issue which could be a mix between it's hard and also priority as to what we make right so it's like we've already said previously online like publicly that we're going to be making some adjustments to fluids in the next update which is going to come at the end of october or maybe the beginning of november we've already said that that would be happening and so it's like do we allocate resources to that which is going to be super cool or just turbo fuel on a jet pack so that's the balancing act there um yeah will you add pipes never we're never adding pipes i've told you a million times for years now we will never add pipes okay just drop it you guys just drop it are there any plans to put a blueprint system in the game uh yeah so for those of you who don't know what a blueprint system in the game or blueprint system is in other games uh like factorio which i i never heard of until recently they have uh like a blueprint system where you can take a collection of buildings or something like structures or something and you can set a blueprint for it and you can just copy paste like larger sections of the factory or something like that like little modules that you can recreate which is not the case in satisfactory if you want to recreate different systems you need a hand make everything this has been asked before many times it has been on q and a's before but there are many people who didn't see that before and the thinking right now it's an ongoing discussion uh but it seems like we're strongly leaning towards no blueprints uh for many reasons uh but basically it seems like it's not something that we want even though it is highly requested what about the giant crab in the trailer can we get that so here's this giant enemy crab yes uh not sure when but yes you will get the giant crab will there be vehicle optimization for a co-op there's always optimization going on vehicles are a big bottleneck whether it's co-op or not um and so yeah probably uh don't know when don't know how optimization is always this weird ongoing issue where you just you're poking and prodding at random things and you you can't really just be like i'll do the vehicles right now give me a sec like it's the problems for optimization is always an issue that you kind of have to solve when you put your head in uh deep into it uh so it's never it's never obvious what you got to do any plans to make more randomness like resource nodes random start locations maybe some random world elements uh yeah so this is definitely a great idea especially for things like replayability we've talked about it a lot i think it just sounds like a great idea but uh it seems like we're not interested in doing it anytime soon though the way that it would probably be is as a separate game mode probably so it's like a harder mode keep in mind folks that there are a lot of people who are not hardcore players of the game many folks watching this video maybe are more hardcore or asking questions you're more invested in community and the game itself so we we can't focus just on that so so it may be like make that the only game mode is what i'm saying randomness so it may be that we have to implement game modes and randomness could be one of them uh we do like the idea of game modes and so i do think that that will come eventually and like who knows maybe there could be mod support for making your own game modes like that'll be cool so uh definitely not an impossibility it would be super cool if we had that how's life dog [ __ ] will we ever be able to do something with nuclear waste like shoot it into space or use it for uranium tipped ammunition anything i'm gonna just sort of confirm ish something because we've always said no like that that's just the struggle you have that's a that's a trade-off for nuclear waste because it's so like strong that you need to have an offset but but i i do think that uh from what i understand that there are ideas of how to do that and so there's a a pretty good chance that something will happen i can't like fully confirm it but this is this is like an update on the stance of nuclear waste so we'll see where that discussion goes how about watercraft or underwater exploration this is a pretty hard no it's something that could maybe happen in the distant future but one thing you need to keep in mind here is if we have underwater and even just on water to some degree that means a whole new world like level to create and we even haven't even finished the main world so that's not something that's going to happen anytime soon i'm pretty sure and whenever i talk to hannah about it she pretty much just straight up says no any new maps coming uh so as i answered just in the previous question no basically we haven't even finished the current map uh so probably not there there has been some talk of it and it pretty much just gets shot down every time so i don't i don't think it's happening i don't think it's happening what was your thought process behind the design of the engineer character will we see character creation actually i will link uh or might be able to do the cards which side are they on here so the cards will be here it'll be a link to the developer highlight of our concept artist who basically designed the pioneer and you can sort of see a few of the steps there and she sort of hints to conte uh to character creation and that's a great idea i think at minimum changing color would happen could be good for multiplayer but there might be more uh elements of character creation as well and so as for the thought process you can see in the video she just made it made many kinds and thought this one was cool what are the community managers favorite dinosaurs so mine is the archaeopteryx and snoots is uh i mean the dude's vanilla as [ __ ] all right like he's like stegosaurus or a velociraptor boring is the poison gas going to be hallucinogenic i'm not sure if you're talking about in-game or in real life but uh respectively no and yes does this look infected to you will there be more optimization for our low-end pcs both gpu and cpu side yeah of course there are constantly optimizations i i know that the optimization front and yeah i talked about optimization before but we'll talk about it a little more um the optimization front is never obvious because optimization is constantly going but most folks will never realize it because it's tiny tiny steps but if you rewind back to six months ago and check out the game you you'd notice a huge difference or a year ago it's it's light years uh better okay maybe not light years that's a bit of an exaggeration but it's better it's much much much better um so yeah it's one of those things that you can't feel it as you know day to day or for every little update but uh it is happening and so uh we do care about the low end pcs too we're not just targeting high npcs we're not but high-end pcs will always perform better will you add cheese i've always wanted a cooking thing i wanted cooking where you can get like oh this is kind of gross but what if you could like milk the hogs and then you could put all your food like biomass and lizard doggo meat in a fridge uh or if you don't if you're like vegetarian you could just be like the nuts and stuff you put them in a fridge and you have like a stove and you cook food like this boring [ __ ] about making like stuff at a workshop it's just it's lame kitchen in the hub make some noise do you plan on adding anything like roads placeable similarly to rails but wider yeah so we actually used to have roads way back in the day like prototypes of them internally before the game even came out and then they would cut for i'm not sure if it was technical or design reasons however i just asked the director now and the answer is just a maybe uh he has argued for it in the past but that doesn't mean it's gonna happen even if he is the director of the game that's is he's not like the leader who just leads the way um but so so there's a chance for it yeah and that's basically all i got there i know this is always asked but what about lights or sleeping through the night uh yeah so this question has been asked a million times of course uh and the sleeping through the night part i think the main issue here is that night time is too dark or people have like problems with it so update on lights we still want to do it of course we still think we're gonna have lights at some point but it's just really hard to do for our game specifically so we will schedule time in for lights at some point but we haven't done that yet uh as for sleeping through the night i don't think that that's something that will come because that sort of uh i don't think that's something that will come uh it sort of undermines some points of the game in terms of you know your factory running and you're just speeding the game up kind of thing uh so probably not yeah i think probably not however the main issue when people sort of complain about night time is saying that it's like too dark or too scary or flashlight isn't good enough or whatever or it's too dark in the factory uh especially can't see anything there the main issue isn't lights there the main issue is nighttime sucks you know what i mean that's the core problem night time shouldn't be a problem but it is for many folks that doesn't mean we shouldn't have lights lights will definitely be cool but the main issue is that nighttime has a problem with it so we can try and fix that first or alongside with lights or whatever what will the next update have so the next update as i mentioned before will come at the end of october or beginning of november the the date is october 27 so i don't know when in november it's going to uh gonna be released they seem pretty confident when they said october 27 but i'm not confident so yeah in that update we're calling it like 3.5 or 3.75 or or fluids update which uh as the name suggests there are going to be updates to fluids and i can't say what that is yet what we're gonna do is tease it starting from next week way back when you used to do these like teasing beauty shots and we're gonna start teasing some new features as of next week uh so you can see what's gonna be coming up as well as not just tweaks or updates to fluid but there may be some new features in there too we're gonna see how we go in terms of getting that done in time so that's what's gonna happen with that update you can look forward to that gonna be good will there be a jace poster uh if there's gonna be a poster it probably should be of snoot or me ensn because snoot's lovable and everyone hates me will there be an official peaceful slash passive mode where there will be no hostile creatures at all similar to kind of something that i said before regarding randomness in the game it if that happens there would that would be as like a like a separate game mode right so it's something that could happen if we have game mode support so many people have suggested it it makes perfect sense in my opinion and i think in the opinion of many other people and along with that like a creative mode is something that people have um suggested too something where everything's unlocked and i guess you know there's no cost to anything and you just go ham and make whatever you want so i i think things like that you know could come along how do you guys feel about an underground biome i mean it feels like a good idea i don't like the idea that the spider things there'd probably be more of them but anyway i asked the level designer about this and she said that she would love the underground biome as well we had plans uh for it actually and because of time constraints we couldn't do it however that idea is becoming more feasible so that's pretty cool there's um definitely definitely a possibility for that now i thought it was a hard no but that has changed that doesn't mean we're gonna have it okay i'm just letting you know that the situation has changed with how we're doing things and it it may it may be a thing now so we'll see okay so that was a lot of questions and i hope you enjoyed them and got a lot of information out of them there was definitely some new stuff there was still a lot of i don't knows but it's always i don't know i'm just answering your questions fam and so i just want to quickly let you know that uh of what we do so on tuesdays we have streams at uh twitch.tv slash coffee stain studios devs every tuesday at 4 p.m c-e-t or c-e-s-t whatever the time zone is here in sweden and so starting next week we're going to be teasing uh some of the update stuff so you can expect on thursday next week some beauty shots and some teaser-y stuff so you can start figuring out what's gonna be in the next update so that's something to look forward to so i hope you enjoyed the video if you did you can smash like if you want uh you can smash dislike if you didn't like the video and you can also smash subscribe if you want to keep up to date with some new stuff and get some new content uh thank you all very much for watching bye i'm bad at these all right bye just get out of here uh do you do you plan on anything will we ever be able to do something with nuclear rape race whoa i see satisfactory as the elite uh i see satisfactory as the actually haven't heard of the ass jesus it's not funny it's not funny there's nothing funny about this is really stupid it's not funny
