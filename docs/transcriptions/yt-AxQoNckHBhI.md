> rebecca sanchez, yeah the trains lag a lot on multiplayer yeah it's known, and we're working on fixes for those, so the next update is coming is the fluid update and that will mostly contain, new features we kind of shifted a little bit how we're gonna handle that update, not not like in terms of removing stuff but like how we release it so when the fluid update goes out live it's gonna go out on experimental and then we're going to try and move it over to early access as soon as we can only fix like the major major issues because as soon as that's moved over to early access we're going to release an engine upgrade to the game which will contain like the next engine update to 4.25 which is a huge update for the engine so you'll probably see some, optimization improvements there there are a bunch of like just optimization stuff that we've done for the game, that we tie into data to that update rather than the fluid update, because it might cost like other bugs and stuff, so we kind of isolate those two patches or like those two updates so that we can like work on the engine upgrade thing of the patch blah blah for a longer period of time until we feel like it's comfortable until we're comfortable to move to early access, and that's gonna come in november like fairly soon after like almost immediately after or maybe not immediately after but like as soon as we can release that, we're gonna release it our experimental and then experimental is gonna be kind of broken but then we're gonna fix things as we go along and hopefully that will improve a lot of stuff tied to multiplayer and tied to like general bugs in the game improve performance hopefully and it will help us get the latest engine version for the game essentially so that's going to come after the fluid update, I don't know we don't have a date for that yet I mean we don't even have a date really for the fluid update, but sometime in november, later november we're gonna be able to push that engine update and, yeah that update is called engine update or something I don't know but we're gonna give news about that once the fluid update is out of the way
