> why is mac supported four and not six or eight i'm not asking for more but four seems low especially considering the 128 event so i mean i i mean you know it could be whatever but we have to sort of then balance the game so that it works for that many people right so we we if we officially support eight then in all of our design and everything that we do and the technical side of things everything we do must then maintain that so like i i i'm yeah so like i think when we go with four then that's just kind of the line that we drew so that when it comes to balancing when it comes to technical stuff we know what we're aiming for yes
