### Transcript

> there's another question here I've seen a lot of people making spreadsheets in game any chance that notes tool or signage get updated to make that a more user-friendly feature, I think there's a chance I think there's a chance, I think it's something that like Everyone likes the idea of and I think it works really well with that game I don't know how we would do it but that's why that's why I'm not the person who figures these things out, so maybe there's a nice way to do it I think it makes perfect sense especially when it comes to multiplayer right if like you you and you and your squad have everything you want to do in order somewhere makes sense makes makes sense, leave it on the QA site for sure browse the surface we're not going to do that
