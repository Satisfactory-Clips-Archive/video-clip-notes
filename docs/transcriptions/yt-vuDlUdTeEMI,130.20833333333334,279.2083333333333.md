> lot of cases so one big surprise that a lot of people have been uh kind of been facing coming back from maybe up to three and then playing on update four again and if you haven't been keeping up to date with all our like state of dev and all that jazz which by the way we stream every week on tuesdays at 4 p.m cst where we talk about what we're doing with the game is the uh big surprise that like there's a bunch of power changes to the game uh people are running into to their power grids like going offline or blowing fuses and the biggest reason for this is because of power changes that we made to the game and if you're wondering why we changed power to be like this uh jace actually made a whole video exclusively talking about the power changes for update for check out the cards but tldr we found that the self-regulating aspect of the generators were a kind of redundant feature on most generators due to the game having infinite resources it also caused some confusion and conflicted with the way fuel production works after r3 with the polymer resin by product production and it also gives you guys a little bit more control in your hands uh such as with the power source and whatnot so i so i just copied jace's homework and i presented it as my own a plus plus plus plus plus a lot of people will point out that this is like an issue with pipes and like changes we've done to the pipes but we haven't actually made any changes to pipes or the way that fluid dynamics work or anything like that um most often when i've been talking to people about this it's mostly that the the power like setup isn't set up for like generators running at 100 capacity um so that's mostly what people are running into now there are a few pipe bugs i'm not gonna lie uh but for the most part when people are running into these kind of issues it's mostly because of their power setup hasn't been like accounted for 100 fuel consumption and not gonna lie this is confusing because one of the issues that we have with our fluid dynamics is that they're kind of hard to like teach and they're hard to like explain um we are kind of happy with how like the complexity of do fluid dynamics uh we don't want to really change that too much one issue we have is that it's kind of hard to like explain what's going on in the pipes etc etc so a lot of people are confused about that that's something we're probably gonna look into more in the future but just wanna say if you are finding the fluid dynamics confusing or if you wanna know more about it please check out our discord and like our steam forums and ask awake because people are really helpful in this regard and uh there are a bunch of tutorials on how pipes work um so i really recommend like reaching out to community and and ask for help because this is confusing and uh the best help out there are you
