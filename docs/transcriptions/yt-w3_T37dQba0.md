### Transcript

> anything about me any ideas on a more detailed map uh i mean we are gonna like the map is gonna be more detailed um we've been playing this before oh no um the way we currently work with the game is that we have a uh we have like working on two different branches of the bake or maybe even three uh actually where it's hard for everyone to work on the same thing at the same time crash um did it crash or is it saving maybe turn off autosave or or increase it or something otherwise you're going to get that random from time to time um yeah so uh the way we work currently is that it's really hard to work on the same thing at the same time so like if when we're in pre-production and then our artists are like making you know what will the factory building look like and how will it you know the model it and everything and then the programmers take over and then implement it in the game but then while the programmers are doing that what are the artists going to do right so the way we're working currently is that we have like two different branches where uh we have people working on like the world the level design and and all that stuff um while the programmers implement uh new things that the artists have made and then they it goes in a circle right so they once the programmers are catched up then the artists start working on the next thing um and the the issue with that is that when we're working on the world um it's kind of finicky to like keep updating the world constantly so we're saving the updates for the world to be more irregular and we have an update of the world in a long time now and it's coming it's not coming up day four but it's gonna come at some point after update for with the world so it's gonna be a big huge like update with just changes to the world and then you can see a lot of changes
