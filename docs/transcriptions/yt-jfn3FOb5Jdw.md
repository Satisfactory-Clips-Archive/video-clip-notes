### Transcript

> murders so many what about multiplayer updates so multiplayer updates are not in this update they're coming in like the next coming patch, with our engine upgrade, that we're releasing sometime in november, like the the timeline that- I mentioned this before I'll say it again the timeline right now is that today we're releasing the this update our minor update the three points point three 3.3.6 update, in between three and four, where we'll update fluids and we want to get that to early access as fast as possible so we kind of like shrink it down as much as we can feature feature-wise and once we move that over to early access that's where we're going to push our very experimental, update which is going to be like optimization engine upgrade, hopefully some fixes to issues that people are having multiplayer, and that's gonna live on experimental for a while probably because that is probably gonna take some time to fix, and then once we got that over to early access then we're gonna release probably the modular build, so sorry modders, we just wanna like get things in such a like small releases as possible so we have control damage control over like bugs and stuff as we're fixing them, we'd rather work long term than short term right now for that stuff so instead of like cramming as much as we can into timelines each time we'd rather try and fix things properly now
