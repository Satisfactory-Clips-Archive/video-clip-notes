> proprietary, coffee stain in-house developed ai we're, we're entering the ai market it's gonna be good it's a shallow freak so yeah jace is in australia, right now yes it's true I would live here you have lived there I have lived there for a very long time, so this is what what we meant when we said that we're going to be in different time zones, and boy howdy are we in different time zones this time like yep it's it's kind of, I sure do have a midnight start tonight so yeah from 12 to 2 a.m yeah because right now it's yeah it's midnight right now right yeah yeah it's midnight right now yeah yeah we're past so, we we- I mentioned this the last couple of streams so we we right now we moved our time slot up one hour so so it's not hella late for chase it's still going to be pretty late for you once the stream is over yeah and we may shift the stream around schedule around a little bit to kind of like accommodate what works best for us we're still trying like you've been in australia now for like two weeks wait, let's see here one and a half weeks yeah yeah something like that we're still trying to like accommodate like what works best for us, like internally as well like when we're having our meetings and stuff like that, yeah it's it's, it's really tricky because like the the time you know a nine hour time difference is really inconvenient like if it was bigger or smaller it would be fine but this is like the worst possible time yeah it's like right in the in between where like it doesn't it makes sense for like a couple of hours a day but I don't know so so we might try out a few things with the stream, schedule and maybe we'll start streaming a lot later, so it'll be like more yeah I think that might have to happen later because at the moment I'm in brisbane and that's one time zone and I'm going to be going to melbourne at some point, in a few weeks and when I do they're like another hour ahead again and I don't I don't think like I'm not going to stream for morning, so yeah we're going to we might we might have to do a little bit more moving around but for the meantime we can stick with this yes work for the next few weeks at least so so, we'll keep you guys posted, like I said before the, on the twitch page there's like a time thingy countdown like I'm gonna try and make sure that that one is always correct like, but we will post on like twitter and discord and stuff like that you know when we go live but also in advance so you guys know like what time zone what time to expect, for the stream if you wanna tune in, and, you know maybe maybe maybe we can't accommodate everyone maybe some people go go to bed early or this like yeah they're up early for the stream or something like that I don't know maybe some new people will show up we don't know but it's gonna be like this for a little bit yeah yeah but it is so some people are saying like am I gonna live here like I'm not, it this is a temporary situation so we're just gonna have to work around it for a little while yeah someone else is asking like why am I there like I have all my friends and family are are here so like I've been visiting my brother for example I've seen my nephews for the first time ever and hanging out with my friends a bunch so it's been it's been like five or six years since I've seen any of them so that's that's basically why I'm here yeah pretty pretty valid reason I think I think it's a pretty fair reason yeah I think I've seen your family and friends for six years yeah yeah I can't imagine what that's like, at all someone said before great comment here jace will probably move somewhere safer than australia like the crimson forest yes that is safer than here for sure, what was gonna say I'm stalling stalling my brain is not working yeah so it was a comment yeah so ruby mentioned like why not just use, jason at bot for dev streams literally already thought about that my dream would be if we could do an entire stream with with us not actually being honest, so so now I've just gotten ideas nice perfect cool cool cool good so we'll see we'll see am I on holiday again if I was on holiday I wouldn't be streaming at midnight no I did so no I am working I'm working here we're still cooking along
