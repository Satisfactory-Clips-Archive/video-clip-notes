### Transcript

> could you talk about the station changes for those who might not understand the filtering okay so like one thing could you could you bring up the stop settings section of the video so that people can see the ui yeah uh so we added a thing called stop settings and stop settings um basically yeah when the train stops what should it do trains will always stop at every station but you can define so it's a bit later keep going more more more more here it is right yeah it's next segment yeah it's nearly there oh there it is we were talking about congestion specifically right yeah so this part yeah so just up there uh just go forward a little bit so there's that that let it let it like pick something from load yeah sure yeah yeah that's good um yeah so like um on these stop settings you can choose whether or not a train should just load or unload uh one one load of things or if it should wait till it's fully loaded or unloaded um you could specify whether it should also wait for a specific amount of time or not you can set that to zero you can also specify whether or not it should load or unload specific items you can also set it so that under the load or unload you can specify none so then it unloads it never loads or unloads anything it can stop there you can set the wait time to zero it just stops and then starts again so you can do that if you want as well the loading and unloading basically means if anything is set there then the train will only load and unload those specific items if they're present if there are other items present uh it will leave them alone and that's pretty much it yeah and i think also on top of that you can also make it so that you have and i don't i wouldn't recommend this actually because i tried it and i didn't i didn't fully see what you want to do this but you can also have like one of the train station containers contain like you know uh two items and then have a train come in and only pick up one of the items in that cart so you could have a train station that only has like one station and then have it still distribute two different types and have like two different train lines come in and pick one specifically uh the problem i had with this though is it's hard to like make sure that it doesn't back up one part exactly so you can yeah you can you can end up in a situation where like it fills up one part only and then you don't get any of the other part and then you end up in congestion issues so i i wouldn't recommend doing that way but you can technically do it that way i'm sure our folks out there will find uh good ways to make that work yeah probably yeah the hard part is like making sure that like if you want like a 50 50 split or yeah it is really possible right now yeah um yeah so that's pretty much it and so like the like i said in the video as well one of the main reasons for this feature to even appear the stop settings feature is that now that trains stop and start all the time because of signals congestion is is like an issue right because trains have to wait for other trains uh and so um using these settings you can if you're if you're sort of i said if you're clever enough but if you you know if you figure out how these settings work well enough you'll be able to um use these settings to minimize the amount of congestion you have in certain uh cases there's a typo in freight yes there is yes don't worry about it
