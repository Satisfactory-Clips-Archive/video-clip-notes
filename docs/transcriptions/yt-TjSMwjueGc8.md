> my name is mark chan yeah, when we'll have train collision I don't know exactly, we've we've we're gonna work on an early like after update three, or like before up to three but then stuff keep like bouncing around I think the reason we're not working on the train stuff is because we want to like fix the stuff that's leading up to like vehicle stuff related things and trains are kind of part of that in in one sense we kind of want to revamp the vehicle system because of reasons that you guys might might have run into with multiplayer, what's this load time about yikes never heard of it what do you mean it's because your save file is so big with like all these real big advanced stuff you know, so yeah I don't know when will but we have we are going to have better like maybe not train collision but like some kind of like fix for a signaling system or collision I don't know exactly what we what we would implement, but the plan is to have that for 1.0 so like at some point during development we're going to fix that
