> and inside to the desert canyon changes, we haven't really done pre-production for that yet so the general thought is that we're gonna maybe replace some of the the gray cliffs with the the brown cliffs, make extend the the desert cliff part a little bit more and just generally give it a facelift, it has the same kind of scaling issues that some of the cliffs had in in the great canyon here where if we did a lot of non-uniform scaling, for cliffs which is illegal apparently, so we had to we had to redo some stuff and we we it's been done over the whole map so some of them are kind of beyond rescue but if you don't scale things like in with the same value in all directions, like weird stuff starts to happen with the shadows the physics break and, in general the material gets really stretchy and weird so, we are now forbidden from doing that yeah I think it's funny that you say that because I remember being in a meeting with epic, discussing this and they were like you shouldn't do it that way yeah nobody told us, until that point and it was like oh [ __ ] we've already built like so much of the map with this it's so funny it's so funny because it actually was kind of epic like telling us off like no don't do it that way when we were asking about it why do you allow us yeah because we were having I can't remember I think you said this before I think it was something with the vehicles as well we're like we have some other issues that we also reached out to epic about like hey we have this issue and we don't know how to fix it and then they meant to like root out that it was the cliffs that were the cliff scaling yeah exactly like the vehicles would go crazy when they're driving over certain cliffs and you're like what yeah yeah, weird weird stuff that you don't expect ever we also we're also told off that we were making two detailed cliffs they were like unless you're making a a climbing game there's no need for the cliffs to be so detailed deeply disagree deeply deeply yeah no red thirteen your art is wrong yeah yeah yeah yeah what it smell like yeah yeah that will teach you yeah yeah what do you guys know you only made the engine how dare they tell us how to yeah
