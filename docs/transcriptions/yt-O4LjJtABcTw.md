> map changes before 1.0 that's another thing I'm hoping we can get out another update on the the on our press kit like the the state of the map, you can sort of extrapolate what's left if you look at the current iteration of the map you check on the wiki there's like a future content or something like that on the wiki page where there's a map of like the the current work that's going in they've been sort of picking up the slack from us, but we are hoping to get another like update on that image out so we can showcase like what's left because there are some changes left to to be made on the map there's a bunch of caves that we haven't finished up there's a bunch of, areas that need some polish, I don't think we're gonna do like another big terrain edition like we did with the spire coast but there are a couple of like you know foliage changes maybe you know sort of similar how we did the swamp you know those kind of changes you can you can kind of expect that some of the stuff, so that might happen and and we have that map in a press kit that shows like what areas are more finished than others so you can check it out there if you're curious
