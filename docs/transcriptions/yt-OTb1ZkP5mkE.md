### Transcript

> um today we had a like actually let me tell the whole story here uh because i i want to kill time so back back long ago when we worked on satisfactory before we even announced satisfactory before satisfactory was in the public knowledge in the public domain if you will um we used to be a little bit of smaller team not as big as we are right now i think we're around 30-ish something people but when we started working on satisfactory we may be like 22 23 25 something like that i don't quite remember and we used to do this thing where uh every other week bi-weekly would have like a little meeting where our producers would like have a little presentation of like what's going on sort of in development of the game and just like showcase stuff that we were working on and talk about because the thing about working on satisfactory is that it is a big game and there's a lot of people working on it and we're all like working on different parts of the game so like well even more so now that i'm a community manager i don't really see everything but when i used to be a programmer you know we did programming stuff and we talked about programming stuff on the programming meetings but we didn't see like what the artists were doing because they were you know in their little bubble and like what the ui team were working on because they were in their little bubble um so so it was nice to just have like these catch-up moments we're like checking out like progression of the game and overall and see what people have been working on and stuff like that and then uh when we launched the game uh we sort of lost the ability to do that because we were focusing so much on like you know making updates and working on getting you know content out there for you guys and fixing stuff and all that jazz and uh we kind of like needed to to streamline not streamline but like make use to the best of our the our possibility our time so to speak um and those kind of meetings kind of fitted away but they're coming back now internally hell yeah um so uh we're we're gonna start doing that again to some degree and uh this today was the first time we did that so we had a meeting where we kind of laid out like what we're working on right now studio we're kind of late at like what's coming up day five what are the things we're working on so yeah excited i'm super excited
