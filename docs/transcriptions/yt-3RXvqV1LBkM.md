> frannie this friend of us is wondering why I mirror my video feed it's because it's a lot easier to like show stuff if I'm like pointing and [ __ ] yeah, if it's mirrored otherwise I just go like this oh wait no this oh wait was it which side is the the the card on the youtube video is it on this side of this side you know what you know you know what my trick is my trick is to look at the camera like like look look at stream and look at the background and see what I should be pointing at yeah I try to do that too but I still like the curtain that's here so like I can see that you're on the curtain side I still mess up because like when you have a video when you have a camera and you flip out the screen it's mirrored all days so like when I'm like even when I'm on like using my camera whatever it's always mirrored so I'm used to that yeah so it's tricky I can't that freaked me out when I used your, your obvious setup and I was mirrored and then chat was like why is everything mirrored
