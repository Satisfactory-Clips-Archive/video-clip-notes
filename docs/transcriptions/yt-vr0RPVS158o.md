### Transcript

> scripted yes why two community managers again so I can play runescape yeah that's almost literally it, no it's so that you have time to do stuff so I can do more stuff and that we can do more stuff because there's a lot of, community management things or community related things that I wanted to do, and I didn't have time to do them all and in fact I had so little time I could only just shortcut my way through everything I did before so that kind of really sucked, with one more person we can do more to like not just like do more things even though we're streaming now, but we can also, put out better quality content, as well as some other things in the community like hopefully we can start doing stuff for translation or whatever yeah and it's generally like like what I said in my introduction video like we just want to be able to engage a bit more because like if we have limited amount of hours every day so like if you want to be able to like answer every single dm you know make videos the way we are yeah like keeping you up to date like it's it's like you were here until like nine yesterday yesterday like which is bad but I wasn't here all morning kinda make up for it but so so it's a there's some pressure
