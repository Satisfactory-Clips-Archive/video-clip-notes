> question the devs appear to have put a ton of effort into making movement puzzles to collect slugs artifacts drop pods all of these puzzles can easily be overcome by using foundations ladders to build up to and around obstacles was there any any discussion to implement a gamer where you could only jump pad parachute no I don't I don't in order to solve these puzzles I don't think so I don't think I don't think that they were necessarily made as movement puzzles because the game one of one of the pillars of the game is is being able to build stuff so, I don't think their intention was ever to be hard to get to without building and I don't know if we can ever get around that since you're essentially free to move in 3d space provided you have some concrete, I think, yeah I don't know I think we have plans to like improve sort of you know the environmental effects and stuff like that that's because that's something we talked about for a long time how like yeah you can totally skip just build up and skip those kind of puzzles or whatever I guess they're there for like the early game maybe when like when you don't have ladders and, if you want to like get ahead in the game like getting power shots like that but I think I think that those things will kind of like be we'll figure that out more as we go yep
