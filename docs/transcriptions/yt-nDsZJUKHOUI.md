### Transcript

> all right, let's talk a little bit about something that we talked about you and me chat we talked about this last week about lights and, how they affect the day and night cycle, we for those who don't know, up into this point well still the game has the daily night cycle of being 45 minutes our day time and five minutes our night time and that made sound like the five minutes night time is the thing that a lot of people are like wait what it's only five minutes it feels like forever, and since we added nights people are like yo we need longer nights because I can't like I don't get to enjoy my lights as much as I want to, just wanted to bring you into that discussion mark what do you think about that I think it's such a fun thing that people started realizing that something like that was annoying them before like that is so short all of a sudden yeah like if we were to bring up this before like before we had lights about like yeah we're thinking of extending the night times we would be crucified [ __ ] oh so funny oh it's yeah it's one of those fun realizations where if something is frustrating you because it's it's annoying to play during night if you don't have the lights yeah yeah it feels like it takes longer right and suddenly you have the lights and you want them to illuminate your factory for longer and then suddenly the light the night flies by yeah, I think we can solve this I mean we have talked about it internally like a bunch of people have talked to me about the fact that that is actually a request now I don't see any reason to not change it but just kind of the balancing might be a problem so I if you don't want to yeah I ran a poll on twitter about it and a lot of people suggested doing like a thing where we could have maybe a slider or something in the game where like you pick how how long maybe not like I'm not sure exactly how that would work but in my head it would be like maybe a ratio thing so like you can pick like I want half the day and half the night or something like that but does that yeah how would that affect the the game currently I think it wouldn't really because there is one thing there's because there's one game play aspect that is maybe not super tied to to the night time and daytime but there's one little thing and that's the spawning of like the little critters that show up during night this the kitty cats yeah the kitty cats exactly, yeah because they have spawners that are specifically only triggered at night yeah or specifically you told me before they're they're tied to like the day time so it's not they're not tied to like the the what's it called the time of day the other tied to the clock so it's like a specific time on the internal game clock I guess yeah exactly for every day in satisfactory yeah so the benefit there is that if we would allow them to extend the night time it wouldn't change how this thing or spawn and I don't think it necessarily has to I don't they I think they already spawned before the actual nighttime like this pawn had, dusk and they'd be spawning dawn I don't know because we in the past already reduced an and I think that them used to be 15 minutes mark mark are you turning into a robot why it's a discord we might need to restart the discord call am I being a little robotic voice now yeah oh no it's good again is it better yeah yeah you used better you just needed a posture check then discord works fine again all right yeah it might be that because this headphone these headphones are wireless sometimes they yeah maybe they do weird

> possible yeah so, so yeah so it wouldn't affect the spawn right maybe the only thing is that like it's not as clear when they spawn maybe because you know like when it turns tonight you're like oh here we go here they come yeah that is a good point actually so you're less aware of I'm not sure how many players are currently aware though it's more of an aesthetic thing that you you can only encounter them outside of caves when it is night yeah and that would stay the same because I don't think we're gonna allow people to I mean we could allow them to completely get rid of the night but yeah yeah I mean it's something that we have to figure out but I think it shouldn't be too crazy for us because I don't think the the daytime is affected by the nighttime I think you can independently make the nighttime longer without making the daytime longer possibly you can say that correctly yeah I will I will have to look into how we set that up again but it might be not the hardest thing in the world and if that is the case then of course that kind of bumps it up and when we can actually try to do it so we'll see is the long short short answer to this is we'll see what happens we'll see what happens
