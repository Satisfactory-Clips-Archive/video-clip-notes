> that I want to show you that the money people don't think about maybe so that's like ambient effects so in in dune desert for example I am making like the you can see like the heat haze yeah that yeah he tastes and there's like some sand dust flying around also with the player so when the player is moving around we have some dust flying in front of you but- I don't want it to be too intrusive or something- I want it to be there but not like necessarily right so it's like you feel it but yeah exactly so and this thing is like so hand I can place it out in there in the desert so if you get closer to these big ones they were just like fade-outs so you're nothing the way or something for you right right it's just like that and you said so like when you're the player and you're running around is it like just some stuff that's just around you that you see or yeah so some some stuff are placed in work to be like further away but this thing that I pressed on right now this is like following the character so we'll always be with a character right right and if we will update the wind direction it will like flow with the wind stuff like that and I actually the heat ace it's because I when I made the heat taste I didn't want like it could be pretty annoying if it's like in front of your face you can see like the resource note here don't have your face on it because if you had your factories you do everything just before yeah so I made a little debug color because I see you can see how it works if it's interesting maybe oh cool yeah so this is like it's a mask black tea right right now the gradient so the most you will have the most of the effects yeah these parts so something so the full effect is at the white places yeah and then it gradually decreases towards the black places exactly so I made it like depth and height as well so it's not like dancing in the sky very cool with it yeah super nice yes it's super nice to see these masks as well because like like I know of masks and things but- I've never really seen how it's made and I and I don't really know what it's look what it looks like when you work with it so it's pretty nice yeah I thought it could be fun to see yeah I think so I think and yeah and also there he tastes it works like during day in the material so it gets the strongest on like 12 o'clock or something you know when this hour cool yeah so it follows the Sun so during like closer to nighttime it will just fade away and stuff like that yeah yeah it's like small things like that that is fun to try out don't it yeah yeah it's nice small little details like I never noticed that I wonder how many people notice that I'm gonna do one of those things down and be like if you notice the heat haze changing different times of the day yeah the comments below yes but like genuinely I'm gonna check that because- I never noticed I'm sorry but I didn't it's okay it's okay there's things that I probably I probably felt it but didn't pay attention to it right yeah I mean that's that's that's a good thing because that's that it's meant to do it's not it's it's just supposed to be there it's just yeah yeah and also
