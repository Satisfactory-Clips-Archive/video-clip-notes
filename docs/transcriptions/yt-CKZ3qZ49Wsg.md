### Transcript

> any upcoming videos on the atmosphere changes or was that all covered is that- I think so when I made the teaser video I was thinking of like is there can I like embellish like the atmosphere stuff but I think I also had ideas to like do a stream where I just like put a camera somewhere in the world and just like let the let time just run maybe I'll still do that actually I don't know if I can organize something I think that would be pretty sweet but, like I think it would kind of I think we kind of ex there's words we've kind of expl like I've there's not much to say other than like we have changed the atmosphere system and the clouds and the the sky will look different in the game, they're much more dynamic

> and the colors will be a bit different they look more vibrant now again and I think that's that's pretty much it so the way I envisioned it was that the swamp will showcase most of that stuff we also have the the rain stuff, I think it would be still cool to have like a time lapse sort of deal going on I don't know better starts at night, it's not well better let's just say I don't know if it's the same sky sphere actually might not be actually I think it actually is completely redone even the planet like the the other two the two planets are also different still the same two suns though it's gonna be able to rain yes it is going to be rain
