> what should we do when we get the server restart warnings I'm pretty sure the game if you're playing I don't remember what happens I think the game doesn't really do anything it just like gives you like a indication that like hey your game game's been running for more than 24 hours maybe you should because the the the main reason why we have that is because when you have the game running for a long time you start running into like precision errors with the calculations for almost everything I believe or maybe it's just like conveyor belt stuff but essentially you know stuff can go wrong essentially so it's good to like sometimes restart your save file or start I don't think you need to restart the game but like restart this save all your own like save and reload it or something like that just like you know get a fresh start on on the counters that's in the game and stuff like that, and that's probably going to exist on dedicated servers as well and it's going to like automatically do something I know exactly how we're going to solve that but that already exists in the game right now where like if you played for more than 24 hours I believe you get like a warning which is kind of strange in a single play game but it's because of that
