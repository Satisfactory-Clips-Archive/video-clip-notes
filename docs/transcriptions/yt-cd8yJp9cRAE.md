### Transcript

> could we ever see something like custom challenges on custom milestones something you and your friends could set up, I don't think that's something that, we've talked much about actually so I'm not really too sure sounds like a great suggestion for the qa site questions on satisfactorygame.com, , but you know you could also make your own milestones but they're more fun when they're in game and then if you get like a reward or something for it yeah I'm not sure it's it's a fair suggestion, consider leaving that suggestion but yeah I don't haven't heard much talk about anything like that
