### Transcript

> um okay so next thing here which i need to read real quick uh jace accidentally leaked something on stream as he's reading yeah uh okay so another person uh i saw another person ask okay so if i have two truck stations a and b one truck station provides fuel the other is just like an unload so there's no fuel being provided there does the truck station that provide fuel give enough fuel for the entire route or does it only give it half the fuel to get to that location and then it doesn't have enough fuel to get home right so what actually happens here and this is regardless of how many truck stations you have in your uh in your in your loop within like on one particular recorded path uh the way it works is every truck station will top up your vehicle to the amount of fuel it needs to complete an entire loop so if if you need 100 units of fuel to complete a loop uh and you get and you've got three truck stations to provide fuel uh each time it hits one of those that provide fuel it will top it back up to 100 again whether it's on 50 or 60 or 20 whatever it's just gonna give you how much you need to complete the entire thing right if there's no fuel in a truck station the truck will assume that this truck station does not receive fuel and we'll just we'll just drive on by so that's how that works somebody asked if it's the same system with drones and i'm pretty sure yes i'm pretty sure the design for the truck station is based on the drone way that's i actually don't know yeah but uh yeah because i think don't drones they only go they only have two things right yeah you do two things but it's the same similar thing they're like if you don't have batteries coming into one drone port it will assume as if like oh no big deal i've calculated my batteries from back and forth i believe because they can only go yeah yeah so it is possible for your trucks to run out of fuel in like a really weird case where the station that's supposed to provide fuel is completely empty and no fuel is coming in somehow as your truck shows up so that's possible so just gotta be careful there that's all
