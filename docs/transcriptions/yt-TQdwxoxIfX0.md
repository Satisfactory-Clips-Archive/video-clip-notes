> official world support is also something we're going to add at some point I think we kind of like it's we're in a weird spot right now with mod support because we're kind of like half supporting it, right just because we've been helping them out so much and we spent so much time like making sure that the game works with like the modding culture right now but we don't really have official mod support because because it would be weird to just like cut off what the mod is going on right yeah we feel we would feel like if we were if we wouldn't help them like at this point because there's already so many cool mods, but but I think I think there are still a ton of things we could improve when like when we actually have mod support I think we could improve the modding like community and the tools you guys have even more, and I don't know exactly when that will happen, but that's something that we're really looking forward to because like we don't even have mod support and there's already so many amazing mods and it's like the modern community is thriving, and it's it's also getting better all the time for for people to make mods so like we're super stoked about that so yeah that's the state of that thing
