### Transcript

> don't lose the height function of the beacons if there's only markers yes that is, that is something that we've, thought about, there's there's so so the there's a few reasons why we will miss beacons one is the height thing, one is the like immersion part of it or like the fact that you're like physically interacting with stuff in the world making it like you know it's it's a it's a it's a it's like an experienced thing right where you're placing it and like you you get to interact with it and stuff like that, and there's, some people also use markers not as markers like they use them as like notes almost, to like jot down like little messages or like secret stuff, for in that case you know you can use you can still use signs, for that stuff and we feel like we've seen people move over more towards sign I think some people just don't wanna don't want change, for the immersion part I think it's just like, like we always ask ourselves like does it add anything to the game in terms of like what you're actually it's useful for, like the beacon is like placing down the space elevator and like interacting with that and seeing it and like enveloping all that stuff that is like an experience thing that weighs a lot in the game placing down like a beacon and seeing it in the world doesn't have the same weight to you know in the game, it it's like it's one of those things where like it's among many things it adds to that right but it's not like a huge part of the game hinges on this like one interactable right and and maybe the fact that we're removing like a couple of them goes more towards like that aspect of it being gone in the game, but we also feel that the the complex like the the the what's the word here like the fact that it's so clunky outweighs that experience in a sense, because there's been a lot of frustration from players with the markers and the way they work, and the only way for that we felt that was like to move away from that was to implement the market system that we had and when we were doing that we just felt like what is the point of the market in the world if we're going to have this system they don't really like coexist very well so that's one thing but as for the hype thing we don't have a solution for that just yet it's it's one thing that we thought about doing is, integrating the, the, like the alt right clicking thing

> so you can create a marker that way as well, because then you can actually be on like a floor and the point on the ground and be like okay this is where I want to place it, so that's something that we're still discussing a little bit, but but yeah just just you guys know we are aware of that and that that that is something that people want, so, yeah we'll we'll see how it goes like during during, update six during experimental horse is dead yeah exactly save the beacons hashtag
