> about that, so let's talk about what changes in production lines there were and, we'll take it from there but no no like specific recipes or numbers just yet just the overview of what's changing so the production line of bauxite refinement in two aluminium ingots has changed this will affect alumina solutions aluminium scrap and alumi aluminium and aluminium ingots nailed it first try now so i've got a little note here from mark i could have like paraphrased it and you know turned his homework into my own just changed it a little bit but i think it's just much better that i read it straight from him so this is from director mark the main challenge here was intended to be the back merging of the water byproduct and a longer production line using a variety of different resources however we feel the setup has gone out of hand for the start of a new phase which is supposed to be interesting or just different and not necessarily complex also we're still looking into reducing the number of refineries outside of oil production and alternative recipes and boxsite refinement uses a lot so this will impact aluminium alclad sheets and heatsinks the next thing that's been affected is a turbo motor production line so the thing with turbo motors is that it's an incredibly complex part and that's good we we really like that however that sort of just means it doesn't work for tier vii anymore so we're gonna promote that up to tier viii as i was saying before or as mark said rather tier seven is supposed to be sort of this this new phase that's supposed to be more different rather than complex so turbo motors would fit better into tier eight than tier seven so that's moving super computers and radio control units are going to be getting a bit of a change as well so even though these parts are unlocked in the mam, they're still considered late game parts and so they're gonna have to be adjusted to fit the new additions and changes in tier seven and eight the nuclear fuel rod production line has also undergone a bit of a change we're adding a new building, to update for i'm not going to say what it is just yet but we felt that the, this production line could benefit from using that building so all parts that are, introduced with the nuclear fuel rods are going to be affected by this and there will also be another production line related to the nuclear fuel rods in tier viii so you can look forward to that so there's also been a change to the battery production line, so batteries will have its own spot now in progression and will have some very unique use cases as well it will also require the the new building that i alluded to before so batteries are going to get a bit of a bit of a change so there are a couple small other things
