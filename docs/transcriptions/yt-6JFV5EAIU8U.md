### Transcript

> when will we implement gravity physics to the buildings, so we we yeah i don't think we're gonna add it right but like we did play around with the idea of, support like structures and like strength and stuff so you have to support your buildings otherwise they'll fall or crumbling down, i think we prototyped it and then we didn't like it i'm pretty sure that was how that went down and then we aren't doing it now, it would definitely be satisfying to just like remove some foundations and watch your factory fault of that would be pretty fun yeah but that would also be a  simulation nightmare in the current state of yeah yeah performance
