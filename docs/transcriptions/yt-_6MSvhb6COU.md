> how do they this by the way how do the hover packs like, someone brought up just now that like jetpack is also in tier 6 but they're not really like the same equipment I don't know how you view it but like how do you how do you view like hover pack versus jetpack at this point I mean they're they are super different, but they kind of feel the same spot in the sense that they both can be used to make it easier for you to go get around your, factory course the jet pack doesn't directly help you with building but it helps you getting potentially up onto a refinery or getting from one part of the factory to another and that can help you get an overview of your factory right getting up on those high places moving around more quickly more practically, in the same sense that in a way the the blade runners also help you with building because you can instantly jump onto a splitter which gives you a slight elevation which makes it a lot easier to build belts between your factories from there have you seen the people that like because a lot of people point out in chat too like yeah jetpack is for exploration whereas hover pack is for building have you seen the people that like take the hover pack for exploration as well where they drag like power lines the further down they go that's the first thing that I did

> who would instantly because we play with cheats right I think you have mentioned this before like you mentioned the fly mode as well but the first time- I had the hover pack- I had no cost on so I wasn't paying for anything so I was just building power building powerpoint power power poles you just keep flying everywhere yeah I mean you can do it it's that's why it's not that fast we kind of wanted to limit that that use case, although some players have been suggesting maybe to use batteries then I can fly around everywhere I don't really want to support that but I think if it's not that fast and if that maybe is an upgrade if we move it to like earlier unlock and then we do an mk2 over pack it uses batteries and there's a lot of options there gotcha cool
