> I wish we were more people observing him can we shame him can we shame him online hello my name is yannick Reuter Berg I'm a freelancing composer and sound designer I've worked for coffee-stained since since about October it was almost a year now I've been working as a sound designer for image inform their game steamer nice I've also done the sound design for the journey down chapter 3 by sky Goblin the vision for the sound and the soundtrack came from the mainly job but also a lot from Gustav the level designer but earlier composer for sanctum one I believe in goat simulator we've had different different approaches I mean in the beginning where we when we were trying to come up with a sound for the game we had a lot of discussions because we were a couple people with a vision everyone has their own visions you'll work towards that common sound it can be stressful at first but when we eventually found the Snyder we wanted haven't been been working quite freely and I enjoy that with office thing because you're not a pressuring company I've composed all the music so far we've had I think it's four sort of different boxes of music I guess you can say you have the trailer music which is I mean something else itself tempo and it's it's catching and very different from the in-game music which we divided in three sets exploration music for when you run around outside of your base

> and then you have the night music the factory music which plays when you're in your bass which is a bit more more happening less cinematic and more structured no satisfactory I've always I start up the game I take some screenshots of of the area for example if it's exploration music or just a factory and then I start filling about with different sounds I rarely have a strong idea beforehand I have the feeling but not the melody and not the sounds I get that out by just playing I mean it comes quite naturally when you start this soundtrack is very strongly based on a hardware synth called the ARP Odyssey which is it's an old one from the 80s and it has a very distinct SiC sound and you can hear it and I think 90% of the tracks it's there somewhere

> it suits the game and it's sci-fi but it's also a little bit retro I use a program called reason for some reason or writing music but then I mix and master in another software called qubits which I'm sure people will know who works yeah I compose for other media I've been composing for quite a few mobile games and anything it's a completely different format it's it's not as fun it's not as creative because it's usually just two tracks that loop over and over again so you can't do anything dramatic I can't go bananas the same way I loathe deadlines but I also love them because they mean I've never been as productive as I have been working for coffee saying that's the problem for me anyways working alone I don't I have this you know it has to be hundred percent he can't be 90 percent because there's always something you can do better and so you end up only releasing a song per year we're not releasing it at all they can find me on Soundcloud I also have some old music oh it's qualified under the name of sleepers delight at SoundCloud that's Spotify at your house I'm a serious human being I mean follow me and I will put up music every once in a while yeah I also do quite a bit programming for cops thing usually it takes about 30% of my time and I also help James out a lot I mean he really needs it try to be unique don't don't follow any bandwagons if you like something if you like working in a certain style other people are gonna like it too always strive to become better because people will notice and be humble and you will get jobs if you present yourself as a homework person not as hello I'm the best in the universe hire me my absolute favorite composer is called Thomas Dvorak the composer for most of Amanita designs games and he writes such beautiful music and it's not I'm not a fan of the orchestra you know Hollywood type music his is far from that it's very intimate I really enjoyed the soundtracks feel very appreciated when people they say stuff like and I didn't come here for the trailer I came if with music it's very fun to have people enjoy what you create it means a lot I I really hope people won't be a record disappointed when the music is not as of the beat or you know funny in that sense in the game I think they'll survive
