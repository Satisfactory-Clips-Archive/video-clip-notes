### Transcript

> just want to have Road pieces again we've actually worked on road pieces way way back when and I don't remember why we stopped working on them I don't think it's an impossibility that we'll have them but also I'm not sure how high prior they are at this point in development it might be a bit tough to get them in, over other features but at the same time especially with blueprints people are making some really good stuff when it comes to roads they take a bit more effort there's you know they're not like dragging and drunkness well they are when they're blueprints but you know they're not like easily buildable like conveyor belts or something are, but these look really really good and in fact this was made with blueprints, I think there was someone on either the last stream that we featured we may even or maybe it's two streams ago he was making all these like Highway pieces in blueprints, and yeah so I think there's been like a lot of good work when it comes to roads and blueprints how often do you make zero mistakes I have never made zero mistakes not even once
