### Transcript

> what is your favorite biome so far boy I mean my favorite biome is always the latest one because like- I can see myself improving every time with like how how I build things or just like sometimes I have this thing where- I don't necessarily like something for what it is but for what it could be if that makes sense, when I see like the potential in a place or or like oh like all these things that I sort of still have in my mind layered on top of it that changes things too but like I mean I really like how this spider coast turned out I'm really proud of it, I'm I mean northern forest's the same thing like I don't know like it's it's all cool it's yep we talked a little bit about this before too like when we were comparing the different clips here and between the the, rocky desert and the, spider coaster you just tilt the camera to the left here not tilt wait it's roll whatever no it's not roll whatever, how like the cliffs the way we're doing clips now looks different compared to how we used to do them and they're like ah do we go back and look at the, change all the clips again but then once we do that we're going to change it again pan is not the term I'm looking for chat by the way I see a lot of people say there's a lot of a lot of terms that people always use like pan and stuff like that where it's actually not correct I can't remember the actual term whatever, no it's not swivel there's there's a fancy diagram for like filming

> I cannot remember everyone just uses pan like just pan left I was like all right that's pen exactly the movement is part of it too, so yeah we just never never stop working on the game I guess no yeah that's the that's the risk too right like you're never really done, you just have to decide you're done at some point and then that's that's your limit because you could always always make something prettier like there's a lot of work I'm doing on the sparrow coast that I'm I know that I can I can improve it and I can make it better but kind of like we talked about earlier like that that 20 improvement would take me the same time as working on this entire area like again right it's just not worth the amount of time and effort for the the small amount of gain even though I know it's possible it's not, there's other sacrifices too like doing not for sparkles means that suddenly sparkles is gonna be so beyond quality-wise the rest of the map that the rest of the map is gonna kind of suck in comparison right that's something that you also have to keep in mind like we don't have time to upgrade every single area to the same exact level we just have to kind of keep it, the moment you like improve something above and beyond the rest you kind of start needing to improve the rest as well so you shoot yourself in the foot again it's like like eternal improvement cycles right, because you want to sort of equalize the level of quality across the entire map and like- I'm absolutely already pushing that and shooting myself in the foot with that with this kind of stuff because like also because like I've learned so much ever since I started working that like you know everything I do like I want it I want it to be better and I want things to be nicer but not I shouldn't always do that right you have to keep things consistent too yeah stop getting better hannah yeah yeah yeah it's like oh no before I, go mad with power you know or we just work on the game forever I guess that's a big problem
