> will that be a feature to delete a whole blueprint all at once, you mean to like delete one that's already been placed I don't know if we're going to be doing something for that yeah I mean we already have the mass dismantle feature- I made I mentioned that in the in the video that like yeah one thing that we kind of ran like one thing that we noticed when we were making blueprints is that like and I definitely noticed it because when I made that video I had to redo the video entirely because I messed up so like yeah if you place the blueprints in like if you have like a manifold that I did for instance then you have like the belts going in One Direction and you mess up and you suddenly build like a blueprint going the other direction like game over right you have to dismantle the entire thing and it's like I guess it makes sense if you can build so much at once then maybe it does need the ability yeah exactly, Master's mental is probably too annoying yeah so when I talk to Mark about that it was like yeah that's that's annoying, we hope we can figure out something to solve that but we don't know exactly what that would be because like one way to do it is if we had like an undo in the game but if we did that for blueprints why don't why don't we do it for everything, and then if you don't why don't we do it for everything yeah so like exactly, so so like if that's the case then we need to implement a whole new system for that yeah, and but maybe it's fine to just have it so like if you can dismantle like an entire blueprint or something like that we don't know at this point, and I think it's a little bit up for discussion still internally because we're still sort of rolling out blueprints we're still not fully done with them so like taking up like a new feature on them at the moment is, is this isn't the best time for that essentially while we're still trying to but regardless it's great to get that feedback right yeah that's that's what's going to help us inform those decisions later for sure this is this is like an example of like a really tricky thing when when it comes to like game design where people like just add this feature it'll be great but it's like well when you add this feature like we add it right now but now there's like a real potential other problem that we need to solve now which becomes I was never there to begin with and is is non-trivial right yeah and without that solution maybe this feature is no good right so it's it's kind of tricky we have to always be super super careful and picky with what we do yeah but it's really important that you guys let us know what you want so that it can help inform our decisions yeah sometimes it's like it's better to hear what you guys's problems are rather than what you think the solution is, because it can help us sort of when we're planning other solutions to like figure out how those problems can be nested into other Solutions does that make sense yeah, yeah pretty much because oftentimes you know this is not for everyone but like often more often than not is that like when folks have an issue they they'll suggest one solution that solution doesn't take literally everything into account but we have people that work with us we've designed everything and every possible you know configuration who do take everything into account yeah you're just hearing your problems are good because sometimes unrelated problems can actually have a related solution yeah and then we get something really elegant if we're lucky yeah because like the whole development blueprint is kind of that it's like we're trying to solve many problems in one way and a lot a lot of people always say like no but Implement Blueprints and that will solve this particular issue was like yeah but we're not we're not doing it just because we want to solve that solution we want to figure out what that group problem is and not until we've like expanded all different like you know Alternatives, we can commit on like one thing or another so like blueprints definitely could have like blueprints could have been very different and, I think I think this is a pretty gracious like in between compromise where everybody loses in the way that they're designed but I think it's really good honestly I've had a lot of fun with blueprints, and I don't think it ruins the game too much like there's definitely those people that are like I never want to use blueprints, and those people that are on the Spectrum were like they need we need more blueprint functionality whatever so let's check it is off make the game you want it'll be just as good or better than we can imagine thanks a lot for the faith there Chris Dixie Chris oh Chris, we will do our best but we will also accept feedback but we can do our best yes
