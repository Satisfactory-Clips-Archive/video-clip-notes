### Transcript

> are confirmed how about mods for creating maps will that happen and someone else did house before are we gonna make new maps in the future I have no idea whether that will be a thing that's probably just too solid we don't want to think about that right right now yeah we can finish this one map and then we'll see if if we have the time and resources to make more maps and then as for and as for mods but there aren't people can make their own maps again that's probably something we tackle when we look at momentum will see that can be supported essentially that being said though like I've played this game for a long time I still haven't seen the whole map even I haven't I don't know I don't know my way around every time I go driving I'm just like [ __ ] where am I how do I get back it's it's so big and we've challenged someone to cut like they're like I'm gonna cover the entire map we're like alright try good luck yeah it's just not gonna happen it's just not gonna happen localization support there will be there
