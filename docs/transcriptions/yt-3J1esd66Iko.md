> but we are in early access just bear with us, there's it's it's impossible for us to like while we're in early access to be like let's fix a bunch of multiplayer things or let's fix a bunch of bug fixes because if we do that we're gonna like be stuck in that for god who knows long and that's going to delay updates and it's going to delay the game overall, so we kind of need to like base it on like is it good enough to keep moving okay let's keep moving, i know i seal every time i post on steam it feels like i see a bunch of people are just like start working new updates just fix the bugs but if we did that then you wouldn't see new content in a long time and we would also be stuck there forever because we would keep re-fixing the same things over and over again every time we'd release a new update which historically has always been the case so far with the game so we know that that's the case so it's tricky we're in early access we're just gonna have to jimmy down and yeah please bear with us in that regard cool what am i talking about i feel like i i ranted for too long and, i don't know where i am right now
