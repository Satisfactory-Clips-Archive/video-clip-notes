> how are you dealing with old issues on the qa side is there a chance of old issues getting forgotten um i don't think so uh if i mean you can always you can always resubmit stuff to get it in front of us again but we can always check to see certain issues that have been uh upvoted for quite a while also the person who um manages a lot of the qa stuff uh kind of keeps on top of or is aware of issues even if they're old they've got an uncanny memory as well which is somehow they apply that they they've never forgotten anything in their life which is bonkers but um but yeah like so but there is a lot of things that like issues that might be old but uh struggle to get prioritized on top of other things that can be one issue or it can be an old issue but like we don't have a clear solution or we do have a solution for it but it's planned to be fixed with other things as well uh and so we don't really want to deal with it now because it's gonna get taken care of later so that's usually what what happens with the older issues yes it's also like some old issues may need to be like kind of confirmed again that there's still an issue and stuff like that but yeah we're pretty on i don't i don't think you guys should worry too much about like missing stuff on the qa side like me and jay smith stuff but that's because we're stupid but we're but we're not we're not the ones who chooses what we're gonna be doing um yeah there are other people who are on the qa side much more than which is another like kind of like drives the point of like the importance that you guys do go to the keyway side and don't like go to us for these kind of things because we will forget it we will like you know we can always you know we still listen to you guys but like the keyway side is really the the spot where we would want all the feedback because that's that way everybody says yep
