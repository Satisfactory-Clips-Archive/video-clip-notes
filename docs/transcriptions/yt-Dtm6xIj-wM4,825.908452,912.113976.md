> yes okay I guess I can just elaborate maybe sure yeah that we release story in the game it won't be the main driving force of the game because that's obviously factories and the story itself is largely optional in the way that if you look for it and if you want to to essentially politically wrong with it you can you can find it but it won't be there all the time explicitly essentially so it will essentially be given especially when there is context that is needed or during tutorials for example and story serves a good purpose in that it can tell you why you're here what are you doing what's the goal etcetera etcetera and also for example fix-it the company you work for gives context to the gameplay yeah that's that is it more lore yes yes there's lore yeah it's it's I guess it's more lore kind of stuff that there's also a more like contemporary sir line that plays as you play essentially so it's it's there is something in the background going on
