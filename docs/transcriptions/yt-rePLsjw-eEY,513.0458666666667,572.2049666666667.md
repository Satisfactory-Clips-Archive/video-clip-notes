### Transcript

> we're on the topic of conveyor lifts by the way, one kind of annoying thing with the game is whenever you're placing conveyor lifts freely on the map, they would always sort of start with like the input and output being in a separate way so when you're placing them freely like this, the bottom layer will always be like the input and the top layer would always be like the output, so one thing we've added is that you can now sort of switch the build modes for the conveyor lift so if you hold r you get this radial wheel that you get with the zoom mode and stuff like that you can now pick reverse, and that will reverse the order of operations here and you can also just press r and that will flip it so if you have situations like here where you know that you like it's easier to drag it from the bottom up rather than the other way around for instance if you know that like you wanted to go in a certain direction you can like drag it out you can come over here and then you realize like this is the wrong direction just press r flip it and, there you go making it a lot easier to place conveyor lifts imo you probably didn't miss this
