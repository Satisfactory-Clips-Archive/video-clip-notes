### Transcript

> i've got a question here one moment yeah uh were you were you guys tempted to tease signs i know you guys kept that close to your chest no no we we weren't tempted to tease science we uh that was one of the few things that um we knew we wanted to keep a secret the entire time there was another thing that we planned to keep secret but we ended up sharing what was that um well customizer but we didn't really no was it something zooping maybe no souping was pretty early on wasn't it yeah yeah we did end up teasing it early but there was something that we were like we're going to save this for the patch notes and then we didn't i think yeah i think we changed order um because we did that we saved the customizer instead of something else now that you mentioned it yeah it's true yeah uh it might have been zooping actually i think it was zooping um but it was the thing is it was one of the things again it was like we needed content to be able to share and it was one of the things that was done early you know like people had yeah so that i could we could demonstrate it early yeah um yeah because that is a big part of it like what works right now might make more sense to show now and i think that that's the main reason but science was like one of those things where we definitely wanted to say science were actually at that point pretty finished um apart from the ui like the functionality of science because that was something that we've been working on since update three four a while ago yeah yeah yeah we did start on that like quite a while ago and then stopped on on it for a while i think and then started again yes
