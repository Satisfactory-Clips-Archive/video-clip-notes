### Transcript

> I reached the build limit is there any chance to set up, to set it up in update five, so the thing there I mean the build limit is a is like an engine specific thing it's not like a limit that we have set ourselves you know, and so it's actually the amount of like game objects that are in the world right, so there are things that we have done to make existing buildings use less objects so like sometimes a you know a constructor can have the input the output ladders or whatever and these are all separate objects but there might be things that we can do so that that object count gets reduced per buildings and that will, give you more space to build, more things but we can't really just raise the limit so there might be some changes that will will reduce the amount of objects in game coming in update five I'm actually not sure 100 or not if there is, but if you want to increase the object limit there is a way to do that I think we made a video on this a while ago and, yeah or maybe the video was the video addressing that specifically it was just like an addition to the video yeah I don't remember it was there was also I think there was also like what things to change in the confines but the thing is even if you change that limit like we cannot guarantee the stability of the game at that point so we can't even like yeah because it can corrupt your save files even in those cases oh can I do that as well yeah yeah yeah so it's very, it's not recommended by anyone like not by epic not by us so, but but if you if you take the precautions and like back up your save files and stuff like that then then you can do it I believe this if you google this there's a reddit post about this where somebody like put up like everything you need to know about this it's also on the wiki I believe, oh true satisfactory news that youtube channel has, a video with a detailed breakdown of the item limit that's true and includes some special info from us let's see if I can find that like that's actually news and yeah like save times and load times are like sometimes three times as long and stuff like that, I think it's this one can you actually reach what's two billion objects two million wait two million yeah two something million should be two in-game objects is not the the the like it's it's you objects which is important yeah the memory object it's not the in-game item object like- I think it's this video and if it's not well now you're watching a different video but I think it's that one well they deserve a view anyways it is oh nice
