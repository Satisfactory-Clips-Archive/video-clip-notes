> yes and it's pure yeah how high on the priority list is truck physics I don't know how high it is, it's hot but it's like oh we don't want to touch it yeah and not really anyone else did anything with them apart from me actually they worked for me and then I think someone did something and now they're broke I swear to god it wasn't me yeah I mean like the I mean that the the vehicles expanded since you worked on them like there were more things happening with their c they worked for me so I could spend some more time on it if I could find some time but I mean famous last words I don't find time never happens, but we are but we are thinking of like we are going to like revisit vehicles at some point I think, it makes sense it makes sense
