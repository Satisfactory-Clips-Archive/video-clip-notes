### Transcript

> pretty funny what happens if you place a signal while two trains are in a block so, it depends where you put the signal and where the trends are in the block but basically again like the the trains won't like freak out because the signal has been put in the block the the trains just look at like they're gonna enter a new block and they just look at the signal and if the signal says yeah go ahead they just drive in and that that's it that's all the rules that they had they're like well i'm allowed to be here and they'll just go, if you put another signal in front of them while they're in that block i'm pretty sure it will update the blocks and they'll stop at that signal if they need to yeah but they don't just like freak out and stop where they are or anything no you might get like an error if anything i can't remember that's what happens or if it's just like oh it's all gucci i think you get an error on the signals and be like something's wrong
