### Transcript

> it would be pretty helpful if you could make a youtube video explaining feature creep like why did signs take so long if you're about to change your release schedule, that's a pretty good idea maybe but like I don't know if it's as exciting as you would think I mean like science I don't think signs necessarily took long because feature creep no they did certain things was it because of feature creep yeah science did actually here's here's the full story because I did work on it a little bit there was this was even when I was programming science was supposed to be like part of update three I think but, we did like one quick round of making signs and then, we were like oh that's cool signs work what if you could do this with signs and then like we prototype that and then like well what if we could do this with science and it just actually became this weird feature creep of something that was supposed to be just a small thing, and it ended up being just like all right let's let's skip science for now and just focus on pipes, because it was dylan who worked on science and dylan also needed to work on on you know the pipe situation so they were like all right let's pause signs for now and then we'll come back to it at the end when we finish with pipes and then the pipes took longer and that became a whole feature cape so it's a really strange feature creep actually with the signs, and I think we had even more ambitious ideas what to do with them we just had to land with it because like it was kind of getting out of hand at one point we're like we we just gotta have we just gotta make signs like come on guys like let's not go overboard with this yeah but we yeah I guess yeah maybe maybe science would be a special case because I don't know if like a lot of things suffer from it necessarily because you do it is important to ask questions of like how can we further justify what we're doing or how can we explore other things like you do need to do that that's still part of the process no scientist back is still part of the process but like if science was an outlier situation that might be an interesting thing no yeah- I would I really science was definitely like an exception exception to the rule here like we haven't had a feature creep like that ever since, interesting yeah science was really weird, I think mainly because like when we first thought we should add signs everyone just had an idea like that was very basic, and it was like one of those like it shouldn't shouldn't take that long to make and then that kind of evolved into a weird like like if they're easy to implement then why don't we just add like this tiny little extra feature to them, interesting yeah cool
