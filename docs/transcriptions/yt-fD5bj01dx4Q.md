### Transcript

> when is update 5 coming out of beta, well it's probably never coming out it's never coming out of beta because the game is still in alpha but, and it's going to be until we'll release it but, hopefully it will release like we will, move the the version from experimental to early access like some at some point maybe later this month I don't know exactly maybe later than this month I'm not quite sure historically it's always been like a month ish in experimental until we move over to early access but we are going to unveil sort of kind of soon-ish maybe this week even, when we feel confident in putting it on early access so stay tuned for that make sure to follow our socials and and whatnot
