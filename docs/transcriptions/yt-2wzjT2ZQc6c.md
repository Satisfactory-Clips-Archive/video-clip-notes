### Transcript

> someone was asking has there been any movement on the Mark III Miner having an extra output or whatever, no movement as far as I know so focus on blueprints yeah but- I assume that that will be addressed I would be very surprised if that doesn't get addressed at some point one way or another I don't know how we'll do it but, yeah it would be really weird if that doesn't get addressed we did address the nuclear stuff at least that's that's progress yep the fact that you can overclock nuclear power plants because it didn't make sense in the game yeah what what was it was the water or something yeah because like the a regular nuclear power plant was like 300 Water so if you wanted to overclock at the 250 you'd needed more than 600 which is more than Max yeah exactly so, so like the solution here was to often just change the water requirement for all nuclear power plants, because we we can't solve the fully we can we can make it better and we probably need to rebalance pipes probably anyways but we can't fully solve the whole more than 600 in a pipe, we can't do more than that because we're already seeing issues with 600. so, solution was to drop it down to 240. which I think is pretty nice because then you get like a better number for the water because it's like 240 is like two water extractors, so it scales a bit better
