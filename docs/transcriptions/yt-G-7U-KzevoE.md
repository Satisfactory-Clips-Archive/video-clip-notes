> gotta love the explorer yeah what a what a great piece of equipment does the explorer keep like simulating when you're off when you're you like parked it is there is this a thing where like you drive up to it and then jump out and it will stick or, no I actually think it just does stick okay yeah because like we've had I mean we've had smirk and I think like park it upside down so that there are some I know I know that when I was working on the vehicles that there were like some things that I had to combat where, when the the vehicle's wheels would retrace down and hit like retrace down relative to the vehicle so if it's 90 degrees on its side it's retracing to the side and it would hit the ground it would be like we're on the ground now and then it starts like behaving as if it's like flat on the ground yeah and yeah and then you could just drive around like on the wall so like some things in yeah yeah yeah I had to put some things in so that it wouldn't do that but there are absolutely clearly some cases where I can still do that there might be other some other properties with the explorer like it's grip and, and things like that which help, keep it there, when it's yeah that's it so that that might be part of it so there are there are a bunch of still a bunch of edge cases where this kind of thing can happen so right thank god you're not a programmer anymore because that looks hella like that sounds hell of fun being able to like drive it it wasn't fun at all I mean I was working with a system that was not meant to be used and we didn't find out about that until like a year after I was working with the system so you know I had to work with what I had, sounds like fun that that's not that's not to say that I would have done much better if I had a better system that's not I don't know okay but I worked with what I had yeah yeah but it produced this image sort of so yeah here we are today we're it's a win in my book all right yeah I think it's fun right it's fine yeah I blame lim cool yeah let's do that she would have fixed it at this point yeah yeah sure it's the other programmer's fault yeah why not yeah you're right it is the other program I'm not the one who did it exactly I'm not communicating it was the other programmers yeah yeah
