### Transcript

> so we're gonna move over to state of dev if you if you have not noticed we've, moved the schedule around a little bit, for a couple of reasons but, one of the reasons is because usually when we end the community highlights people jump in I think like part of it is like you know our stream starts at, 4 p.m cest which is like a good time in europe but it's kind of early in the us so a lot of times it's like people come in one hour into the stream and they're like what's going on which I mean happens all the time anyways regardless of what time we stream but so, we're moving state of deva we're a little bit for, in this in this in these trying times, and testing it out you know, we never want to like get stuck on just doing one thing for forever you know it's important for us to, do what makes sense so, here we go fam state of dev bam well let's do it let's talk about what happened last week what happened last week you you may ask, I sweated a lot that's what happened last week I put out a video last week or we put out a video last week, showing off some of the new, let me see if I can pull it up here, showing off some of the new weapons that we're working on and showing off, some of the changes we're making to the equipment system I also just wanna [ __ ] by the way by the way I just wanna call myself out on this, this thumbnail is probably like one of my favorite thumbnails I've ever made okay oh so dumb oh holy [ __ ] anyways, oh it's so stupid, so a couple of things we talked about or I talked about in that video was, I tried to like, make a little bit more sense with the beacons I think if you guys were here last week I also talked about the beacons a lot during the last stream we stream and if you didn't know if you didn't hear we are planning to make a lot of changes to how the map functions in the game and an integral part of like that is how the beacons used to function and how we plan to use them now, we felt that the beacons were a bit too like cumbersome for people to use we sort of lost out like a bit of I think a lot of people felt that it was, like a bit a bit tedious to use the beacons, that's at least what we found in our when we were evaluating this, so so one thing we sort of realized is that we sort of need to to simplify the marker system that we have in the game even though the beacons are cool and whatnot, you know just a little bit tedious to use so we plan to sort of do away with beacons because we want to replace them with this new marks marker system that we have here, so in the video I talked about this how, we're planning to do away with the beacons in the game look at me what a [ __ ] fantastic freeze frame look at this guy looks like I'm about to sneeze, so, so yeah like essentially what's gonna happen in the game is like the beacons are still gonna be around, for now in update six, because of a few reasons it's it's mostly [ __ ] go away where's the
>
> [Music]
>
> here it is, it's mostly because we want to like backwards compatible a little bit, because if we just ripped out the beacons now you kind of lose out on a little bit of functionality that we also want to improve further down the line so the beacons will still stay in the game for now in update six, but you won't be able to use them in any meaningful way so you can still craft them but like as soon as you place them you know they'll just like go away from your hand and just disappear essentially and they'll get turned into these new markers that we have, in the new marker system, so yeah so I talked about that I also showed off some of the changes we're making to the equipment system which is over here so if you if this is your first time tuning in to anything, fun fact we're adding multiple body slots, I know this is something that a lot of people have been looking forward to and this is definitely something that, been highly requested if anything a couple of things I want to address when it comes to this a lot of people have asked like why did it take you so long to to do this change, parts of it is because we didn't get around to it until now you know we've always said that we want to like do a revamp of our equipment system, and you know part of that was also doing an evaluation of like okay but if we do change our equipment system what is the actual change because we had some ideas to like mitigate the problem that we had in the game where you know people a lot of people wanted to have multiple body slot support we also wanted to think like okay is is the problem that we need multiple bodies law support or is the problem something else with equipment, and that was sort of something that we wanted to evaluate before we said like yes or no to like whether we would add multiple body slots or not and we kind of wanted to do this at the time when we're actually implementing it because it's not just you know director mark sitting there thinking like this is a this is a actual one-to-one representation of how it's like for mark being at work it's not like director mark's just like this is off as like yes we will have multiple body slots because reason a there's a bunch of like prototyping that's involved like it's not just one person who's making these decisions it's like a team effort because we are evaluating like okay what technically is the problem we do this what is the game design problem if we do this, and then we sort of come together and come to a conclusion, and for some of these cases when whenever community wants something really badly, we end up finding a solution that we think is better than just like just add this one thing and then we'll fix it like we can also solve other problems we did in a different way and sometimes like in this case we just realized that, like no it's probably the the best option is to add multiple body slot support, for a couple of reasons and I think I think one of the main reasons why this is actually the better option to do even though we had some ideas on how we can change how equipment works because the main thing really is that we feel like if we just had one body slot we would want more equipment to like switch back and forth between so it makes more sense and then maybe have like equipment that serves like two purposes so for instance if you want you know jetpack and blade runners in the game there would be an item that sort of fulfilled that sort of role, so that was one approach we were thinking about doing is changing completely how equipment is made and like what equipment exists in the game and the problem with that is obviously that it takes more time to implement more equipment types than just like fit the existing equipment with the current game essentially so so that's a little bit of the rationale behind why we we we went with this approach instead of the other one so so essentially the way it works and I didn't explain this in the video but the all the the slots obviously are used for you know fitting a certain equipment piece so you can put your your jet pack on your legs for instance you silly dogs, the jet pack is for your back and like, the gas mask is for your head and the body is for your hazmat suit and the legs are for like the blade runners, it's always possible that you know maybe in the future we'll add more equipment, right now we don't have too many plans for like additional equipment but it's never impossible right but, but what we do have in mind is tweaking sort of the the functionality of said equipment because, specifically like the combination of equipment is really the interesting thing here, so you know a couple of tweaks that we're thinking of doing is having it so that, we added in update five so that hazmat suit would always also use as like a gas mask because at that time you couldn't equip the gas mask and the hazmat suit at the same time now it makes more sense to have them as being separate you know entities, and you know have them, use the different, filters that they have, so you can you know you're using a both the gas mask filter and like the radiation ions- I ionize radiate whatever the nuclear filters can't [ __ ] talk, because we've also adapted the ui for this too, it there's a little bit of a let's see if I can showcase this there's a bug in this build that I'm playing here where it doesn't actually show up but what happens is it shows you like everything that's being consumed in the corner here as they're being consumed so when you're flying and like using the gas mask the gas mass filter will show up here if there was like a radiation here and I have the hazmat suit on it would show up all these like, consumable filters that I'm using, iodine cool that's that's what I was trying to say but I apparently need to read it to be able to say it, so so that that's like one of the tweaks that we want to do another tweak we want to do is the, the combination for like blade runners and jetpack, that's something that we've always talked about how you know it kind of messes up with the level design a little bit because we've one of the main problems really when switching to this to having multiple body slots is that exploration and like the level design that we have in the world they're designed for having one thing at a time so like whenever we made like level design puzzles if you will like jumping puzzles when you're trying to get like a slug or something like that but they've always been made with one equipment at a time sort of so now that we're adding multiple support it kind of ruins that whole exploration bit a little bit, so
>
> [Music]
>
> so like certain combinations of items will kind of break that, so there's probably gonna be a little bit tweaking I don't think the I don't think like I think one misconception a lot of people have that is that that means that we're gonna nerf blade runners and jetpacks, which is not the case, we're probably gonna allow people to do that but we probably want to save that for like late game right so like the last tier or whatever so, and and that's the case for I remember when you unlocked the jetpack but if we also balance the equipment we can also have it so that you can equip, you can unlock some of the equipment earlier but maybe in like an in a less op state so you still have like the combination that you want, but that's more for end game which is totally fine like once you're in game you know it's totally fine if you're superman, and you know you can do everything but we still want to attain sort of the aspect of exploration in the game where you see a slug over there in the distance and you know there's there's a bit of like okay how do I get that, and you know reward players for being able to reach the the slug and stuff like that and that goes for both slugs and like all our working progress items in the game so there's a little bit of balancing towards that direction but it doesn't mean that we're going to like nerf everything essentially we're just going to give you more options essentially so so one approach that we might do is and I'm saying might do because we haven't really fully decided everything yet but one approach we might do is we might do so that like, you know you can unlock the jet pack but maybe you can't use it like maybe in the state that it's in today that's if you have like turbo fuel in it or something like that so if you just use like regular fuel it might not function as well but like later in the game, you'll be able to use like a better tiered or maybe there's a mark ii jet pack or something I don't know, but but that's the idea at least you know to to sort of balance the equipment better towards this system, so hopefully that clears up that stuff, anything else needs to talk about this I'm thinking
>
> [Music]
>
> cool I think that's it
>
> [Music]
>
> so yes I think that's that's most for equipment stuff and is there anything I'm missing here in the video that I forgot to bring up here, what am I doing here I'm flying around in gas very cool very cool all right so let's talk about the, weapon types that we're adding so similar similar kind of like energy here we want to do, we don't want to like now that we're looking into equipment and we're re-evaluating weapons and stuff like that we don't want to add like new weapons but we realize we can also we can do a lot of stuff with what we have in the game already so, we've opted to add like different weapon types for the rebar the nobelisk and the rifle so, by the way these icons are working progress or like their placeholders so these will also get updated oh yeah [ __ ] I forgot you know holster [ __ ] dude how about I forget about that, that's like the best part of this whole video where is that
>
> [Music]
>
> it's over here whatever, stream over yeah you can holster now something that like wow I can't believe it, I've almost legit like wanted to implement that myself just because like I just gotta have it in the game at some point, holster is actually the best feature in update six imo not gonna lie, close second is the pulse and the cluster noble disk and I'll tell you why in a second, but that is like yeah unironically that's the the main thing I really wanted out of this update, and, here we are so a common question I've gotten is like why did it take so long to to add this and the answer is like similar to before asking like you know we there's a lot of stuff going on with our game and, we just haven't got around to it until now so and it makes sense for us to like plan this because we're doing equipment system changes and this is tied to equipment so you know trying to get like everything, in one go is sort of big so so yeah now you can hide your nuts very cool, I'm still like trying to get used to this by the way, because from time to time I'll find myself opening like the the where is it like from time to time I find myself opening the menu and like almost dragging out like the equipment I'm holding because that was that was a workaround we had in the game right where if you had an empty slot like this, if you selected the rifle and moved it you would unequip the rifle in your current hand, so I've gotten used to doing that and I still have the habit of like opening this menu and almost doing it and I realize oh no we have a [ __ ] holster button and then I switch back to the game and press h so there's a little bit of like getting used to, but it's super dope and obviously you can rebind it to be you know whatever you want, we picked h because I don't know for some reason h holster I don't know, so so yeah fun times all right let's talk about weapons so weapons, we've added a bunch of stuff for the for the weapons we've added three more animal types for the rebar we've got the, the shotgun rebar we got the the stun rebar and we got the explosive rebar, and, they're kind of like- I can't really say because I don't know right now I forgot to ask mark about this but, like the use case of these different rebar types they're they're used for like different things essentially I found that the the shotgun rebar is really useful towards like spiders and stuff like that because they're moving very fast and they don't have a lot of health, so it's really easy like one shot then with the shotgun if you're like jumping around the explosive rebar is really good against everything because it packs a [ __ ] punch at least right now this guy might get tweaked before updates come out but I've had a lot of fun using the explosive rebar, just because it's so goddamn strong I'm assuming the explosive rebar is like a late game thing because it really makes like every fight pretty easy we might tweak this actually since I've been playtesting this but, yeah it's it's pretty cool and the stun, rebar is like for breaking ai patterns so if you're getting chased you can use the stun rebar to like break out of the the ai behavior that they have we'll probably talk a little bit more about this once, once we talk more about creatures because we haven't done that yet that's still something that's in the pipe so to speak
>
> [Music]
>
> but we are making changes to like how the ai behavior functions and in some cases some enemies will be easier and some enemies will be harder so hopefully that will function a bit differently not coming this friday no and, yeah so so pretty dope one thing that I really really hope we add is so you can like use, actually it doesn't make sense never mind, so those are the reward changes, real quick and then we have the rifle changes we've changed the regular rifle to have 15 slot ammo slots instead of 10 is one main thing here so let me get that scene so check this [ __ ] out right 6 out of 15. very nice, I don't know why but for some reason I really thought that we didn't have like semi-auto fire on the rifle maybe maybe I'm just dumb but I feel like we you have to like manually click every single shot, I don't know I don't know it's just maybe I'm wrong on this maybe someone can confirm or deny this or maybe we added this at some point but- I don't remember the rifle being full auto you do you can hold okay maybe I never tried it, so so I guess it's not a new feature in update six whatever, but yeah we changed we changed a little bit of like how the rifle sounds, a little bit how it functions as well with the spread, because it used to be the rifle was all like all [ __ ], line trace before, now it actually does a little bit of scattering, not a lot but a tiny bit you can see in the hud that like the bigger the the the the what's it called cross hair circle you know the more it will spread out, the rifle is the like the default ammo type for the rifle is probably the most accurate, rifle shot so, so yeah we've also added a, second ammo type that's like makes the ammo makes the rifle, more like a minigun almost, it's like when you hold the, when you hold the shoe button the the trigger it will like, it will increase the fire rate as time goes and then accuracy reticle that's what that's that's that's the word for that, what was I talking about
>
> [Music]
>
> yeah so it just turns the the rifle into like a machine gun sort of, increase the size of the the slot as well and, good times will be had by all the the color on this cartridge by the way is wrong in this this build, it's supposed to be red just so you guys know I don't know what the [ __ ] happened there so just you know and then last we have this like homing cartridge kind of deal which is like if you played titanfall, you kind of know like the smart pistol you kind of know what this deal is about, super funky it's a bit like, like all this stuff is working progress right so this this one is a bit funky right now, so visually it looks a bit strange but, but yeah I suppose like if you're aiming for something within the the accuracy reticle you know it will make it easier to hit stuff and this one is also 15 and also the stack sizes for all the the ammunition types have increased a lot so there's that one thing I also want to point out maybe we'll say that later actually we'll talk about that later, we got noblesks we got, how many was it four five different so we have five new nobles coming in update six, we've got the pulse nobelisk we've got the pulse noble is by the way is so [ __ ] fun to use, like less so as a weapon but more so as like a traversal thing, it's super trolly so people playing online like you can have a lot of fun with this is all I'm gonna say, I actually don't know what happens if you stick this on on another pioneer like multiple ones and if you're gonna like push around I need to I need to do some experimenting once the stream is over, but this is this is so far my so one of my favorite like admin types that were added, just because exploration is so much more fun with this so like coupling this with the, like blade runners jetpack and like the pulse noble list together is a deadly combo, can you catapult all our other players so it kind of functions the same way as on yourself like so it pushes them away right, so yeah very good very good very a lot of fun, so you can sort you can like recreate this moment with other partners as well right boom look at them flying off the cliff very nice, so here's what I'm talking about here you can do like rocket jumps the I'm just I hate that this like part of the video- I don't I'm not showing it off fully here because I kept missing, and I didn't have like too much time showing this off but you can do like really fancy stuff, with the pulse nobelisk when you're rocket jumping on it then we got a cluster bomb which is a grenade that explodes and then we'll cluster into like four or five smaller nobelisks and they will detonate once they hit something, one really cool way to use this, this is also one of my favorite new additions to this it's like the cluster when the pulse one are just chef's kiss, one really cool way to use this is if you see an enemy in the distance you can like chuck this in the sky and then blow it up and then like that it will rain down like nobolists on the enemies, I was really trying to like recreate that for one of the shots that we had but I didn't have time unfortunately for this video, but that's a lot of fun doing it that way, can you use the pulse to save yourself from fall damage I think I believe you can yes, although I think it's gonna be quite tricky, but technically you can yeah, possibly I haven't tested it so I don't know if that's true actually but tech I think theoretically you could, so yeah the cluster is pretty dope in this video I also I also make a point how like this is really good for like clearing out the foliage there's a bug right now in the game where the the smaller clusters don't actually clear out foliage that's why you're not seeing that change but that's how it's supposed to be used, it's really good for like clearing it out and like this this grenade is the most nutty one when you've placed like a ton of them because like if you have like 20 of them placed on the ground and you detonate them you know first 20 of them are going to detonate and then the subsequent like, clusters of them also gonna dead so you just create like this carpal tunnel of explosions it's pretty dope, and then last we have the [ __ ] nuke oh no sorry we have the gas noble let's start off because we haven't I haven't actually seen this in action yet, but this is being worked on at the very moment actually, this is like, this is also sort of intended for like early games sort of, where this is more like as a deterrent for enemies so it it when you throw it and you detonate it it will like emit a gas corridor sort of and then enemies will try and invade that so you can create like space in between yourself and enemies by placing them in between you and like if you're getting like, attacked by a, like a what's it called a hog it's like a hog is coming at you you can place down a grenade in between you and the hog would be like ugh gross fart gas ugh smells bad, and it will try to avoid it and that's not like a good way to like avoid enemies essentially, I don't remember if it deals damage in the gas cloud I think it does a little bit but like I don't think this can like it's not a good like weapon to use to kill animals essentially this is supposed to be like a deterrent more so than anything, so so that's what that's for and then we have the nuke nobelisk, which is kind of nutty that we're actually doing this, but here we are but the new nobelisk at the moment is just a bigger like regular nobelisk it just creates like a huge bang also made my computer crash by the way, where and anyone who got like anyone who got punked by this by the way, love you, yeah so it's essentially just a bigger bang it just blows up and right now it's all placeholder and stuff so as for recipes because we're getting to that as for recipes these are using some of them are sort of setting stones some of them are not a really unfortunate bug here, in the video that I didn't realize until the video was finished is that the, for some reason in the build that I had the the standard recipe is actually an alt recipe here so the standard recipe is this one at the bottom here alternate recipe 2. that's supposed to be the standard one so essentially for the regular nobles we've just removed beacons I think I might be thinking of rifle actually what is the default recipe for for, nobles right now in the game it's it's sulfur and, rifle and those beacons gotcha yeah so,
>
> [Music]
>
> so like I mentioned before that we're doing it with beacons, pipe and powder yeah okay so that hasn't changed the nobles so this one is still the same, so so this is a really unfortunate, issue that I wish I would have caught before, we finished the video, but yeah like the the recipes that you see here on screen, the recipe is in there at the moment how it looks right now for like the shadow one there's only one so I guess that's easy but, for for some of them where there's like multiple, alternate recipes you know they will show up as like the old recipe but that's not actually true it's still this one that's like the default one so we haven't changed this we just added multiple alt recipes for some of them, and some of them will still get a little bit tweaked so I don't have like the actual full ones yet I have no idea what the radar tower recipe is going to look like at the moment, for rifle ammo I think it's just we removed beacons from it it's the same recipe otherwise do we show it in this video we had at one edit where we showed act like every single recipe but I think we just like opted for time,
>
> [Music]
>
> yeah this is me talking about the code exchanges too which is also pretty dope like the improvements we've done to the ui here, so just want to clarify that that the recipes you see in the video, don't be confused we haven't changed the or like all dress because like it doesn't make sense that that the the default recipe you need an obelisk because like how would you how would you make one, but a really good point actually, something that I want to point out like one of the main reasons why we're doing it with beacons is because we want you guys to be able to automate everything in the game almost everything in the game, there's a few exceptions but for them like ammo is is one thing that we want you to be able to automate fully so you you're supposed to be able to create like ammo factories, so you can like better use that to like run around the world and shoot things essentially and I know that technically you could have automated it because we you could ultimate you could, automate beacons before, but we just want to make that a little bit easier essentially so so yeah look at me talking for a long time, anything I forgot to mention yeah beacon automation was a pain and that's one of the main reasons why we want to do away with them in the recipes, like the we still have the alt recipe for for, uranium fuel rods or fuel units I think they're called the alt recipe, for now we are gonna remove that eventually, I've seen some people ask like why aren't you just removing everything why aren't you removing it now, and the main reason for that is because we're probably gonna do another, balancing pass for a lot of the like later, recipes and we'd rather do like rip the band-aid out and and do them all at the same time rather than like you know over time remove them, because we will if we keep like changing things on the fly all the time like sometimes we have to do like one major change and then be done with it because we keep like doing it over time then you it's going to be frustrating for you guys to keep changing all the recipes and all the time, so that's the main main reason why we're not doing that, so yes and whether this like balancing thing comes with 1.0 or whether it comes before 1.0 haven't decided yet it might be its own thing just just a patch that just rebalances the recipes, at one point and then we'll have that experimental for a bit and then move it over sort of similar how we've done with like the, the engine updates that we've done, so we'll see but we haven't really like made any decisions as to when if how that will happen we just know that we probably want to make another recipe balance at some point but we always we always knew that, so,
>
> [Music]
>
> yes yeah because like it is an early access game we can never get away from that, so so it's it's you have to expect that things will change in our game, so I think I think I summarized everything in the last week's video, this week we probably won't have any major news because this is a short work week for us we have like thursday and friday off because it's a national holiday in sweden, actually it's like it's like ascension day right so it's not just sweden it's a couple other places but, so hopefully we'll get a video out this week but I don't know if we'll actually make it we'll see there won't be anything major it will be a minor video with just something small cool
