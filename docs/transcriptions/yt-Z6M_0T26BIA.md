### Transcript

> cool let's let's continue on with the show if you can call it that, so yeah state of dev is happening after community highlights today wild sometimes people join in in this time and, they're like oh I missed the state of dev can you do it again so, now I don't have to do that it's just gonna be this moment right here right now right here right now so what's happening, in the world of satisfactory real quick if you guys didn't hear before, some some exciting news from community is that, satisfaction's gonna get featured on summer games done quick by epiphany who's gonna be running satisfactory on on scdq in on july 1st at some time check the screen, check the schedule it's like 3 p.m cest or something like that but check it in your time zone to make sure, we should we should all make sure to show up and give support, it is it is easy to be at home sitting like doing your speeder at home but once you're on the couch things are a bit different so, we gotta get a show that support, and and also check out the, I don't know if that was actually so we also have this little thing, there's another like little cool little lego submission on the lego ideas website, do check it out it it looks super cool give it some love, show it the same support you gave the constructor maybe it will be a thing I don't know we'll see we'll see fingers crossed all right state of dev you guys what's going on what's going on in the world of coffee stains studios what are we working on working on many things, we're working on update six obviously we're working on some things in parallel with update six as well that you guys won't see in a while probably so why am I telling you this I don't know, it's kind of important that you guys know that if you don't know that we're kind of changing how we're doing this update in terms of, well both that we've sort of told you guys what's going to be update six essentially it's going to be all about exploration and we've been dropping these videos on your youtube channel the last couple of weeks about you know some of the aspects that are coming you know this is from you guys perspective this might look very much the same as it's been before we're like yes obviously there's gonna be like you're showing us teaser stuff and then the bam is gonna be a huge release thing for for update six but we don't think there's gonna be a huge release for this it might come kind of fly on the radar, we're gonna have to see and we're also gonna be an experimental a bit longer this time so you know this time

> in the past, we might have like almost delayed updates and this at this point we just decided that we're just going to drop a bit six when we feel like it's good enough and then we'll spend more time in experimental and maybe that will be a bit more annoying for you guys who want to check it out because it's going to be a little bit more experimental than before, but we feel that like we kind of need to do it that way to align with the goals that we have for the game because the goal really that we have for the game is that we want to finish it we want to reach 1.0, and we need to sort of align the way we do releases and updates of the game with that so it might be a bit odd, for you guys this time around, so that's why I'm trying to tell you guys now that might be odd, we'll see we'll see we'll give you guys more news about this but the the key thing I wanted to talk about this week was that last week I showcased a lot of changes we're making to the map and the radar towers and I'm super stoked for these changes myself personally because I always felt the radar tires I've never built radar towers so spooky sometimes when I have my window open it creates like this draft that keeps opening the door and sometimes it absolutely slams it super weird anyways so so yeah I made a video last week about showcasing some of the changes we're making to radar towers and the map, if you haven't seen that video I'll thought I had it ready but I didn't,
>

> I have to say actually the the thumbnail that I made for that video I think it's one of my favorite thumbnails I've ever made for any video cover stain you you know it's me who made the thumbnail by the way when it's dumb that's it, so yeah I'm just gonna I'm just gonna jump over to this whoa snoot what are you doing you're in the on the screen at the same time weird so yeah if you didn't see that if you didn't see that video this is what the map looks like go away this is what the map looks like, now it's a lot bigger you know, it's going to be unlocked about earlier so you'll get this in onboarding yeah it's an exception exactly so, the big the big main takeaway though whoa look at those coordinates very fancy the big takeaway though is that we're kind of doing away with beacons in the game, that is the goal at least we are sort of certain that that's going to be the case because the we felt that there were more issues with beacons than they actually served obviously the beacons are cool like that's that's the main thing that we can't really like replace with the new system that we're making, because like there's there's a there's a certain set of like immersion where like you're actually physically placing a thing in the world and you know that that that is an aspect of the game, but it's it's like the issue that we saw sort of comparably how we want to do it now is that like we're comparing how like an immersive thing which doesn't really add anything to the game more so than like it's a cool factor a factor and like you know it's a and you know maybe sometimes that can weigh you know highly in regards to a game, but we thought we we always disliked like the aspects like if you know you can't adjust it, there's a couple of, there's also a couple of issues with the recipes when you use beacons so like since beacons is an alt recipe you can't, automate a bunch of recipes that require beacons in them until you get that alt recipe which we also were like, not super big fan of that either, and, yeah they were just clunky a little bit so so that's why we decided to sort of like do away with the beacons and replace them with, the system that I have on screen right now which is essentially like the markers they work they function essentially the same way as beacons except you place them on the map instead and an alternative way of like handling some of the in-world stuff is we've added this thing here called stamps where you know you can run around the world and you can like alt right click and that will make it so you can like place a little stamp here and you can customize that both in the world and on the map and stuff like that, so, yeah this inception so so like the the goal is really that we want to like replace sort of the beacons with these kind of systems, but there are like a few use cases where beacons might be useful and we're sort of debating whether or not like like is it worth having both probably not we're not we're leaning more towards not, because those use cases where you still want beacons are kind of like don't really add anything to the game might make it more confusing than anything, it's like yeah it's a bonus feature right but it like, I don't know so the I think the approach is going to be that we're just going to try to the best of our ability and and clean it up I don't know actually what will happen with your existing beacons in update six because like the exit your existing beacons will carry over to the new system I don't know if the actual like physical beacons will actually stick around or they will disappear or whatever,
>
> [Music]
>
> we'll see but the the idea here is that like you know that system will carry over completely, beacon be gone exactly yeah it's similar to like how the paint come was replaced with the customizer right like it it's a cool factor but it's tedious to use the main point of the game is really that it's a factory building game, you know so, yeah we'll see and but we've definitely heard you guys their opinion we've also heard your feedback on some of the things with the map, that we've showcased we are definitely looking into that so, there's a couple of, I don't know exactly what's feedback that we are gonna actually do something about but there's been you know we've been reacting to to the feedback that people are left on the comments on the youtube channel and on qr site and stuff like that, so definitely we'll definitely check that out, a couple of things I want to like address or clear up a couple of questions that some people have had, that I just want to clarify so if you haven't seen the video one cool thing here is that radar towers now also reveal resources on the map, it kind of makes the radar towers useful, instead like before radar just like they just revealed the map and that was it but now you can also see resources you can sort of use this to plan ahead the additions that we're making to the map here they're specifically for exploration you know we're doing one thing at a time we might do in the future you know factory layout stuff on the map but we're not certain that will actually make it in we have a bunch of ideas for that and, it all kind of comes down to like production wise if we can make it or not, we will see so like don't don't anticipate anything for this for this update because in this update the map changes are specifically for exploration you know everything that we're doing for this update are tied to exploration for the most part, so so that's what we're doing so, yeah one question a lot of people got when you saw this screen like is that it's revealing some research but not all so this is tied to the scanner thing that you have you know when you press c is it or is it v now we always flip it around, you know the like wheel you get when you start scanning this stuff it reveals the same resources that you have available in that wheel so the reason why you're not seeing keterium or show up here is because in the save file I haven't discovered catering more, simply put so obviously we'll see all the resources, that you can otherwise c is crouch oh yeah that's true it's v, and yeah as you can see here you can see like the claim ones, a lot of people suggested having so you can see like the purity visually instead of having to hover over it, we've, listened to that don't know if that will make it in front of six but we've definitely heard that, there's a couple of things here with the menu there's one part where's the part where I move
>
> [Music]
>
> ,
>
> [Music]
>
> the menu is is like an updated version of the menu, you're not seeing too much in this video but you can expect to see like the same sort of stuff that you see in the map so like you're not seeing you know, you're gonna be able to see like essentially the same categories as before with the include like including resources, the one thing that we didn't showcase in this video that we're hoping to be able to do is be able to like adjust some of the stuff here in the menu directly so like renaming you know, some of the markers or some of the radar towers and stuff like that, that is planned but we don't know if that's going to make it for update 6 or not, and the other thing that a lot of people commented on was the this thing markers even though I specifically said don't read too much into it because this number is just a placeholder kind of, you know we I think we need to have some limit but we don't know what that limit will be some people have said like I'm going to easily you know use up every single like I'm going to mark out every single berry bush and stuff like that that's okay go for it but, I don't think that's I don't know if that's gonna be feasible your map's gonna be crazy like one reason why we wanna have this limit at all is because, rendering this screen is kind of expensive like rendering ui elements overall like same thing goes with the compass it's quite expensive around like rendering time wise so we don't want people to go to bananas, looking at certain people in chat you know some people have we always sort of you know no we don't actually but sometimes we discuss this sometimes we're like nobody's going to build a hundred drone ports you know somebody will build a hundred drum boards, andrew sit down okay calm down, so we need we need some sort of limit we don't know what that limb is gonna be though maybe it's a hundred maybe it's more maybe it's a thousand a thousand sounds a lot we'll see yeah hold my beard exactly so so, yeah we'll see about that, what else what else what else, some people have commented on that there's like a new creature here it's not a new creature sad to say, what else I think that's yeah I get I if you guys have any questions otherwise I'll do that too because we have the q a section lined up here which is good timing right, so yeah just checking my notes here did I forget some things yes cool I've spoken my no so yeah that's that's that was last week's, video anyways talking about the map changes so what we have left to showcase sort of is we have, on the list of things that we talked about in the release video we have, we're going to talk about equipment stuff we have some, other we actually have more map changes that we haven't shown up that we're gonna do, there's also some changes to the atmosphere and like some of the,
>
> [Music]
>
> like we talked about weather being a thing in satisfactory exactly, we're probably gonna like it's not 100 certain that it will make it in for update six so we might save that for kind of last, before we actually unveil everything just because like everything's kind of in flux, or a lot of things are in flux, so, sometimes it's it's like hard to give like a this is what's coming and this is not like sometimes it's better for us to just wait and talk about stuff when we actually do it but the state of that is like essentially just like we need to have to find time to sort of finish the rain because the rain functions for the most part but it's like it's a bit not perfect, there's some tweaking needed there, and like it's it's almost like is it worth adding to the game if it's annoying, maybe not we'll see yeah polish there's polish and like some logic things too like I don't think the weather will affect too much like logic in the game like it will be a visual thing if anything you won't see like when it's raining there'll be more thingies maybe there will be in the future but, for now it's probably gonna be a visual thing, so there's that there's also, the fauna stuff so there's a couple of changes of creatures coming up, so yes there's still some some nice things to to to show off, one thing also I want to address here I've seen some people be like you always say that it's not a it's not a big update and then you drop banger stuff like maybe that's the case but I don't know if it actually is a huge update or not, like maybe it is for some people but not maybe like what we anticipate like the the
>
> [Music]
>
> majority people would see a big update so, so yeah yeah after rain comes to rainbow so so yeah those those are the things we're doing with state of dev we're still working on a lot of stuff and we're gonna showcase more things you might see more like working progress stuff, in the next couple of videos that we put out
>
> [Music]
>
> just because some things are more finished than others and we definitely don't want to like hold off on talking about certain things just because they're not finished so we'll probably talk about them even though they're not done and they might seem half finished and such etc because we're still finishing up update six it's not out it's not even out of experimental you know even on experimental it's gonna be like a not finished state anyways so so we'll see
