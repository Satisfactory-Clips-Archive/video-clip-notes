### Transcript

> do you want to plans on making it possible to split conveyor belt contents with a custom ratio, I think I we have talked about it before I don't know if we have a stance like it made a hard stance on this or not, but I think I think, from our side of you like I think that that kind of ruins the most part of the game if you're able to do that because satisfactory is a game about ratios, more so than like anything and figuring that stuff out is like what the game is about, so it feels like we're kind of like making the game a bit too easy if we did something like that, but I don't know it's always something you know we always we said before that we're never gonna do multi-build or whatever and we did we did some version of that so you know it's never impossible but, let us know on the qa site how you feel about it and if you have any opinions on what you how would you like that to work
