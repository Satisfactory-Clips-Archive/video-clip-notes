> how about an elevator big enough for vehicles I don't know if we're gonna be putting elevators anytime soon elevators are kind of a pain to make in games yeah right aren't they like really troublesome yeah especially multiplayer especially physics objects yeah we're also, never mind actually, yeah it's a pain in the ass to to have that working and like all the edge cases for elevators and like all the issues you can get when they get stuck in, it's a doozy there's a reason for like a lot of games when they have like elevator scenes or whatever they just like you walk in the elevator and they close the doors and then like it fakes it moving like it pretends that you're moving upwards like it just moves the camera and it's rendered around the elevator and just teleports you up, a lot of games do that just yeah it's like weird like elevators and like doors they're like these they're actually things that like are actually hard to do for some reason they seem simple but I saw a reason funny take on twitter where someone was like you know a like a game development studio really like love their game if they've added doors and elevators in their games like if there's a functioning door in your game we clearly don't give a about hours yeah weekly we clearly don't give a and I'm talking I'm not talking like the sliding doors I'm talking like actual like opening doors because there's a bunch of funky that can happen when you open and you have to like actually program like most of those edge cases it's a pain in the ass
