> linux would be useful for servers yes, it would be but that's a separate thing like the build we make for dedicated servers will be completely like kind of different compared to like supporting the game on linux, like we won't need to like support any graphics whatsoever and that's like one of the biggest issues with supporting games on linux is, graphic support i swear to god like every time i've we've supported games on linux like the amount of graphical issues is just so overwhelming you kind of have to make it worth it and most most times it isn't unfortunately but yeah just having the server on linux is that's viable that's plausible and i think that's something that we kind of have in the back of our minds to do when we're developing dedicated servers
