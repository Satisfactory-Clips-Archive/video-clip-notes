> uh i understand your labs are community people are not really coders actually we're both programmers uh but how would you or that does just learn coffee stuff suggest how to learn c plus plus uh textbooks is one thing uh online resource is another thing i think i think unreal engine is like pretty good in that when you have like an entire engine slash library ready to go it's uh i think it's a good way to learn the language because the changes that you make in code will then also be visually represented in game and you can very quickly make changes to uh existing code bases that way um so i think i think that you know doing tutorials for unreal engine c plus plus tutorials for under engine four or five or whatever i think that's a pretty good way to learn um if we're saying like learn c plus plus from the ground up uh maybe it feels like the engine itself is kind of like all daunting to get into when it comes i think if you follow tutorials online though and they're step by step yeah maybe i i've i've had such a weird path to learning c plus because i've given up three times uh and then like yeah fourth time it clicked for me for some reason for me i like i i i know like a lot of languages and and then when i was gonna do c plus plus like when they didn't even teach me i see this was at school which is crazy uh and so what i ended up doing was i just got a uh i i read a textbook basically cover to cover and that's how that's that's what i learned from z plus plus and then uh and then just applying it so trying to make stuff in engines or doing whatever uh and messing up making mistakes checking solutions online and then uh you get better so i think it's really important that you sort of just start doing things and start running into real world problems um so yeah learning by doing yeah i think i think that's pretty good pretty important but i also think that reading some material like textbooks whatever can be useful as well because they can compile a lot of understandings and uh things together and make it easier to understand some complex things that you may not run into in the real world or not consider when programming i think one of the nice things about learning it on real engine is that you don't have to necessarily learn how to handle memory because you have the garbage collector because that's that's always something that people struggle with uh with like pointers and like memory allocation yeah yeah that's true see because i like i feel like it can be hard for some people maybe not everyone but it can be hard to do like you know i feel like whenever you're gonna do start learning c from scratch by a textbook or whatever if you're just learning the language you end up doing a bunch of really dry examples that are like mostly just theory and not really practical and it's still important stuff to know but it can be really hard i find to apply myself and apply that stuff that i learned in the real world because as you say like it is good to know how the memory management works and this is in the in the language but also when you're doing stuff in unreal engine since that's going to be taking care of it for you because because you're going to be using their libraries it doesn't matter so much but it's also good to know but i think it's pretty good to like also jump around a bit like check out java somebody mentioned that uh like check out some other programming languages just to see like because because once you know how to program you can pretty much do it in every language it's all about learning yeah pretty much yeah you just run into like little pitfalls that you you can solve but as long as you know what you intend to do yeah so programming anything is probably
