> a day in the life of CSS a day in life, I mean it's hard to say because it depends on what you're doing right so like if you're if you work at HR you have a different experience to programmers if you're the studio manager or producer you've got like a different kind of day as well and if you're a community manager like me my day is very very different to everyone else's day, but in my case a normal day for me I would wake up grab rush and put a little makeup oh I'm sorry I'm too tired I'm too tired I don't know if anyone got that yeah okay cool laughs okay sorry, oh I love that song okay, so I wake up right and, and I get to work in the morning like at 8am and I just start like I do bite like I check emails I check DMS and then we have I have meetings like I meet with the programmers every day usually, to hear what's going with them I meet up with the production people to see what's going with the project as a whole, there's sometimes I have meetings where I meet with like the folks at coffee stand publishing to see what's happening marketing wise and the bigger picture of things, and then besides that like on a Tuesday like stream, I set up the community highlights get everything ready plan what we need to do if not it's working he often does that, and I also then work on like scripts for videos I film stuff for videos, that can take like some research where I need to like coordinate with other people to make sure I get the right information, and then like I edit that or, Mason is our editor contractor that we also work with so sometimes I just need to, coordinate with him so I send him stuff he does a bunch of work and then, you know just double check all that and then yeah just just kind of General stuff so that's kind of what like a normal day for me is a lot of different things that are happening so you slid into the DMS exactly so I nearly speed my coffee need a holiday Jace you know what I mean- I just took five months off work and I do feel like I need a holiday, the last few weeks have been pretty intense, but it's also been fun and we have Christmas break coming up so it's it's super chill everything's fine yeah all is good all is good all is good
