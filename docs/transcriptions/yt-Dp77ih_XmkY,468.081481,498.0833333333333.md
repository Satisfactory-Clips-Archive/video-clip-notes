> - Another car's coming
- Yep That's why- I didn't fuck up - I was waiting for the car
- It's like kids, like &quot;CAR!&quot; &quot;CAR!&quot; yeah Alright, here we go. - Hey everyone my name's Jace
- And mine's Snutt And we're your community managers And welcome back to another
patch notes video because Update 4 has been
released on Experimental That's right! And me and Jace are gonna go
on a little treasure hunt in our new office that's currently being renovated to uncover all the secrets in Update 4 That's right! Snutt and I are gonna be going
on a treasure hunt in our new office that's currently being renovated to uncover all the secrets of Update 4 That's what I just said dipshit And in order to do that we
need to do 3 things We need to restore power to the basement We need to find the key to the top floor And then we need to find the secret door
to uncover the final secret of Update 4 Alright, let's go ¡Vámonos! So here we are in the main hall of our new office But how do we get to the basement? Do you know how to get to the basement? What are you doing? Behind us? Look, Snutt! A clue! Did you, like, put that there or? We can play it in that machine over there! Feast your eyes on the marvels of Update 4! In the new spangled update by Coffee Stain Studios The new and shiny Tier 8 is finally
going to be available And in Tier 8 there's gonna be
numerous wonderful sights But before we get into that let's revisit some
of the aspects of Tier 7 Now Tier 7 is getting a little bit of a makeover, you see Along with some new things Based on feedback, our vision for Tier 8 has changed And because of that we need to
rebalance Tier 7 a smidge To justify that change as we found that
Tier 7 to be a bit too complex Now I know everyone loves complexity But the goal for Tier 7 was to introduce new
and interesting recipes While the goal with Tier 8 is to take that knowledge And challenge you with more complex ones Some of the changes include: Battery production being reworked Bauxite refinement And aluminium production has been rebalanced
to reduce complexity and scale And the amount of refineries! That's right Jace! We've also moved Turbo Motors and
Supercomputers to Tier 8 And we've slightly changed recipes for parts such as: the radio control unit, alclad sheets, batteries, and
iodine infused filters We're also adding nitrogen gas to the game Which can be extracted from a new resource node type
we've added called &quot;Resource Wells&quot; Resource Wells consist of a main node and
nearby satellite nodes You simply place the pressurizer on the main node That then activates the satellite nodes Which can then be extracted via pipes using an Extractor Oil and water Resource Wells will also be added As an additional method of extracting oil and water Another thing we've added is a new building called the Blender It will blend liquids and gases together with other resources To be able to construct fused modular frames,
nitric acid, and more! And, in fact, there's a significant change in how
encased uranium cells are produced These will now be produced in the Blender as well And will no longer require uranium pellets
which have been removed from the game Nuclear uranium waste can now be turned into plutonium Non-fissile uranium can be extracted from nuclear waste Turned into plutonium pellets and eventually
make plutonium fuel rods This means you can finally get rid of your nuclear waste Well... sort of Because plutonium also produces waste But it builds up much slower It's also a lot more radioactive, you see But that shouldn't be an issue If you store it far enough away from your base And that concludes our regular scheduled television program On this secret tape And now I'm gonna eat biscuits That's a lot of información Can you say información? That doesn't tell us anything about
how to get to the basement You'll find the basement by walking down the stairs Oooooooooh! Let's go! ¡Zapatos! (off screen) Nearly died Hmmmm - We need to find the fuse to fix the power
- I'll check in here While Snutt looks for the fuse I'll tell you about the
upcoming changes to power in Update 4 One of which is a new building called the Power Storage Power Storages allow players to store excess power Which can then be used when or if
consumption exceeds production We've all done it! We've all been there! We've all hooked up a freshly built section
of our factories to the power grid Only to hear the dreaded [Power Outage sound effect] Power Storages will help buy you time in these cases But there are other changes that will make
use of the Power Storage as well Right, Snutt? No Oh... Just kidding We've actually changed it so that power generators
are no longer self-regulating Previously generators would only produce as much
power as the factory was consuming But generators now always produce the
full amount of power With the exception of Biomass Burners And this will mean you will likely produce excess power Which can be saved up in Power Storages Geothermal is getting a change too Instead of providing a static amount of power Geothermal Generators will now provide a
fluctuating amount of power But you can use the Power Storage to help smooth
over production for a more stable output We're also adding Power Switches that can be used to enable and disable the connection between parts of the power grid And you can name them for better organisation Ooh! I think I got it! Ah shit... Wait- hold on... Wait wait, I got it Wait, one second... Wait for it... And it- wait, wait uh, i Wait for it Bam! I bet you didn't see this one coming We're adding lights to the game Ooh lights! Now your game can be brighter than my future There are 3 different types of lights There are big ceiling lights; perfect for indoors There are tall spotlight towers primarily used outside areas And street lights that are mostly there for decoration Oh and you can set their color and brightness, too You did it Snutt! Best day of my life Now that we've fixed the power in the basement
we can go and look for the key ¡Vámonos! His accent is so good It's like I'm IN France
>
> [laughter]
>
> Hmmmm I wonder where the key could be? It's probably in one of the boxes at our old office You're right Snutt! ¡Si! ¡Eres un tonto! Why didn't I think of that? So do you wanna get them or? Yeah, but... We need a car...
[whirring sounds] - Do you have a car?
- We can borrow Gnutt's car...
>
> [whirring sounds grow louder]
>
> What's that sound? It's coming from over here
>
> [loud whirring]

> GASP Oh boy! It's actually happening you guys! Drones are here! They're designed for long-range, low resource transport They can't carry many resources at at time But they're doing their best Each port can only contain 1 drone but move
across the map extremely quickly And are far easier to setup than trains, belts, or trucks Drones require batteries as fuel And their consumption rate and travel speed become
more efficient as delivery distances increase Simply put a drone port at 2 separate locations Slap a Drone on 1 - or both, to increase throughput Connect your ports, hook up your batteries And the Drone will fly back and forth delivering
whatever you put in the port What a mess You know what would've made searching around easier? If we had a hover pack Which the game now has! The hover pack uses power from the grid to function By wirelessly connecting to nearby power connections Like power poles or the connectors on buildings And it allows players to fly through the factory
and hover in mid-air Not the fastest way to get around but definitely
the best option for pioneers looking to get a good overview of their production lines
and to build from a higher vantage point WOAH! - Jace, look!
- [Adorable sounds] It's a real life lizard doggo
>
> [More adorable sounds]
>
> [Lizard doggo panting]
>
> - Oh my god it's so cute!
- I know, right? Wait Jace! Watch out! It's coming right for us! - [BONK]
- [Cute death noise] It dropped something It's a key! Now that we got the key Where do we go next? Is that right? Where do we go? Yep We fixed the power in the basement - Check! We got the key - Check! So next is... Just say it already! Top floor! ¡Correcto! ¡Entrada secreta! ¡Vámonos! This sucks At least in the game we've added more traversal options Where you can now use a zipline to travel from
power pole to power pole in your base We made it to the top floor! Now I wonder where that door could be... Ugh.. Kill me There it is! Alright Jace, this is it! Behind this door is the final secret of Update 4 Let's open it! Holy shit! It's the artist formerly known as the Hadron Collider The Particle Accelerator! That's right This baby is a top tier manufacturing building And it consumes so much power The power requirements vary per recipe And always fluctuate So always check your power grid
before using these bad boys And consider utilizing Power Storages It's used to produce plutonium pellets
for the plutonium production line

> And also Project Part #9: Nuclear Pasta

> Wow that sure is a lot of stuff coming to Update 4, Snutt! That's right Jace! And all that stuff is available right now
on the Experimental Branch Now, not everything in Update 4 has made it into this video Including things like UI changes, optimisations,
bug fixes and more But if you want all of the gory details We'll leave a link in the description below
for you to check that out That's right! So enjoy your Drones and shit And have a fantastic day And I hope you had fun watching this video I know I did Bye!
