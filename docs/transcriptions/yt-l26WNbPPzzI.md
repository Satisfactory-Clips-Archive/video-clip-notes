> okay it's the same way with uh is it uh vulcan no wait is the other one i keep forgetting which one is the new one uh okay well that's the graphics api yeah yeah is that the new one i always mix them up with wait i was metal yeah i mean i always mix it up with uh apples metal metal oh yeah okay yeah vulcan same thing i've looked into it i've tried it sounds so pretty so much more work but it's so much better but again like everything i've written custom has been in opengl um so it's like do i throw away all that work or do i start redoing everything in a vulcan like the same thing goes in a real engine like it's still not fully supported with vulcan um yeah i mean it's a lot better but there's so many things that are still not done with vulcan that's like can't really support everything yet so it's tricky but it's getting there i i'm more i'm more hyped for vulcan than i am for rust i'm launching the editor by the way hell yeah just so i was wondering i was compiling and then trying to get my camera to work yeah vulcan is a much bigger hill to climb than doing opengl or or i think the bigger problem is also that uh microsoft are doing such good job on directx right now they've like the the later directx versions dx12 they've really improved um but yeah vulcan has vulcan is just smarter in the way they like but it's yeah it's a bigger hill because you need to do more stuff yourself so directx is popping off like it's i've used directx for a lot and it used to be really bad well i mean they tied it to the you know windows releases and that was i think the biggest pitfall was i mean how long was dx9 these were so we crashed by the way it's a late crash though i'm just keeping you abreast of what's going on oh okay i have i can see the window well you can but everyone else can't oh yeah that's true um there's a library called easy vulcan which abstracts a lot of stuff away from you oh interesting i might check that out when i have absolutely no time uh when i feel like i want to hit my head against the wall again and dive into that wait a minute
