### Transcript

> Unreal Engine 5 when no Unreal Engine 5 is already out I don't know if you knew this epic released it a while ago, actually 5.1 is is coming out soon but if you're wondering whether the game will support unrelated 5 or not or if we'll merge the project to 5.25 that is a good question, I think- I think I've talked about this before we are interested in moving the project over to Unreal Engine 5 because there are some benefits, that would be good, I'm not sure how much we can utilize some of the new technology like nanites and, and lumen, but I definitely think we can use them to some extent but not for like everything maybe like like we could definitely use nanite for like the the meshes in the world and then you know we wouldn't need to have lots anymore and stuff like that, the foliage can't be used in nanite so we still need to use our old system and also we have our special system for multiplayer and stuff, and then Lumen would be interesting because it would solve some of the lighting issues and probably make it better or maybe worse I don't know it depends but this is a huge undertaking and one of the bigger issues with Unreal Engine 5 is that the physics engine that the game uses currently is completely deprecated so we would need to implement from scratch a completely new physics engine for the game, and that is a bummer that is a real bummer, but I mean if we did that that's also possible like there's a there's there's this but there's a butt here right because if we do did re-implement the fixes engine that would maybe probably solve some of the issues we might have with the current physics engine when it comes to Vehicles so but it could also be worse like you see you get what I mean here like there's a lot of well there's a lot of ifs and buts and stuff, by moving to Unreal Engine five so we're not like against the idea and I think we would like to, and we've been in that seat for a long time and we're sort of trying to figure out, what to do we moved to Unity instead so that's that's sort of the the issue or not the issue
