### Transcript

> when the game fully releases can we expect as much content releasing like we've been experiencing three four fives into b5 can we expect game altering factory designing there's going to be a lot of new stuff that's going to be added in on the 1.0 release of the game so, one element of that would be story and story related things such as, like the the work in progress stuff are you know like the mercy spheres moana is supposed to be tied to, the story, so there's that stuff and then there will also be some other things as well coming so I guess to answer your question in short yes I think so, but like I know of a lot of things that are coming but I don't know if they're gonna be exactly how much of that's going to be in update 5 or in any of the updates between update 5 and 1.0 gotcha
