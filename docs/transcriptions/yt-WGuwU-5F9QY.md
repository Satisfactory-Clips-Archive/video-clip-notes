> my game starters a lot when looking around in certain parts of the map what performance thing can I tweak, what was the question my game starters a lot when looking around in certain parts of the map what performance thing can I tweak to make it smooth probably graphic that sounds like a rendering thing, where could also be built building on the edge of a tile now if you're looking around that's more like when you're moving around if I sort of assume I'm moving oh okay maybe- I don't know maybe because because if it's just like if you're turning around and like if you're looking at your factory and then you just turn around and it's better frame rate then that's a rendering thing but if you're like running around, and you you run into like issues where suddenly the game stutters that's because of the loading that tile needs to load in a bunch of stuff, and that's something that we hopefully are going to solve in the future when we do our sub-level saving system that we're we've been working for so long, because there's a lot of stuff it needs to stream in over and over again when you're moving between tiles it doesn't all even like it it isn't necessarily even tied to like the tiles that you're currently physically running around on because like you have loaded the two tiles you're on it's like the the tiles around you so it's really hard to like say also like what is the best spots and stuff to build because it kind of depends on where you're standing and like what the neighboring tiles are doing, and that is sort of something that we should probably improve upon we are yeah like like it's like our response like instead of saying like well you should build in a different place yeah exactly exactly we made a world you better build every any way you want exactly because it kind of it's kind of hard to to, to anticipate where those happen because even even when we know where the the chunks and tiles are, if we're standing in the middle of a tile and then we're running around if if like another neighboring tile, like further down the line starts loading in then like how the hell are we supposed to anticipate that we had that issue with the trailer where there's a there's a segment where I'm like running up to the power switch and I like turn it on whatever that was like perfectly on one of those tiles so I couldn't do the full run in the trailer so we had to do a bunch of trickery and like move around so we got it to work but that's something that we we're going to fix at some point I'm pretty confident in that actually it's just a matter of time
