> why does power building overclocking follow weird exponential function uh because we wanted it to there is it does that because there's supposed to be a trade-off between building more factories and using the overclocking feature and that's the essentially because of that and we even in uh what's the word here we all even kind of like over emphasize on that with having the downward underclocking uh curve as well because you always you always make the trade-off between like if you want to you know save on space but you require more power or spend more space but save on power so that's the main trade-off that exists for the game when it comes to that aspect and that's why there is an exponential curve too to the overclocking and underclocking
