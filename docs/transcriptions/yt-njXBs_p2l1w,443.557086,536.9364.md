> all right this one's actually a really long drive, let's take a while we're there okay cool let's look at the, let's look at the the concept art so the next one is magnetic field generator and this is as you can see here it is a project assembly part so this is project part number six magnetic field generator we'll read the description about it a little bit later but it looks very cool looks like it connects so you make multiple of them and they connect together interesting interesting generates a magnetic field i assume so let's take a look at it in game nice i like this one this one looks cool i just want to i just want to plug them end on end kind of some human centipede

> except they're magnetic field generators instead all right so we can see inside very interesting let's pick this one up let's read the description project part number six send up to the space elevator i assume to complete phases of project assembly that's what the project parts do these modular generators use superconducting magnets and vast amounts of electricity to produce an easily expandable and powerful magnetic field so expandable and powerful magnetic field interesting very interesting yo the recipes right there by the way i don't know if we're showing the recipe but it's right there so are we are we blocking this out is it not being blocked out who knows because it's right there so that's cool there they are let's go into the next one all right so next up we have
