### Transcript

> all right this one's actually a really
> long drive um let's take a while we're
> there okay cool
> let's look at the uh let's look at the
> the concept art so the next one is
> magnetic field generator and this is as
> you can see here
> it is a project assembly part so this is
> project part number six
> magnetic field generator we'll read the
> description about it a little bit later
> but it looks very cool
> looks like it connects so you make
> multiple of them and they connect
> together
> interesting interesting generates a
> magnetic field i assume so let's take a
> look at it in game
> nice i like this one this one looks cool
> i just want to i just want to plug them
> end on end kind of some human centipede
> [ __ ]
> except they're magnetic field generators
> instead all right so we can see inside
> very interesting let's pick this one up
> let's read the description project part
> number six
> send up to the space elevator i assume
> to complete phases of project assembly
> that's what the project parts do these
> modular generators use superconducting
> magnets and vast amounts of electricity
> to produce an easily expandable and
> powerful magnetic field
> so expandable and powerful magnetic
> field
> interesting very interesting yo the
> recipes right there by the way i don't
> know if we're showing the recipe but
> it's right there
> so are we are we blocking this out is it
> not being blocked out who knows because
> it's right there
> so that's cool
