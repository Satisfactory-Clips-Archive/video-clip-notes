> high cpu speed is practically required yeah that's that's pretty fair i mean the game right now for the most part i from my understanding is cpu bound a lot of the things that needs to happen so yeah you might especially on dedicated servers because there's nothing to render well yeah of course but but yeah i guess no i know what you know i'm sorry i'm just being an um um it kind of depends i guess how you've built though because like some factories are heavy cpu uh use like users drug addicts the cpu just gotta get that cpu um and for some people it's way more on the rendering aspect like um so it kind of depends a little bit but i think for the most part at least the way ben has explained it before is that like our game is pretty cpu bound um for the most part especially if you have like when you have bigger factories like uh rendering usually isn't the big issue there the bottleneck it's it's that your factory needs a lot of logic to run yep
