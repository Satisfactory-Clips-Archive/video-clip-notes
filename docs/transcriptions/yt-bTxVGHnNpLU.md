> what are the chances of having a hybrid vehicle like a Truck Station train station with ability to transport trucks slash tractors I feel like at that point like the the idea of that is cool and maybe if something is cool that's just enough but like I feel like that's creating solutions to problems that don't really exist because you could just have vehicles on either side of a train station

>, you know what I mean like if we were to do that that sounds like a lot of work to get right that sounds like there would be so many, edge cases to take care of that would be impossible and that'd be it'd be bug prone all this kind of weird stuff it would kind of look cool but it's also something that you can just kind of replicate by creating vehicles on both sides so I'm not sure
