> yeah uh will physics be improved later on like use of steel beams for support instead of floating platforms no uh physics in games is expensive af and uh the less physical so also we tested that already and we didn't like it so uh no probably not uh we're trying actually trying to remove physics from the game as much as we can yeah just remove all physics what do you think yeah why not i said we just remove all physics let's do it the game is just like pac-man just walk around what's wrong with this what's wrong with this i think this is fine
