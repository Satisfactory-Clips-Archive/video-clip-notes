> will we ever be able to equip all the equipment at once I don't think we'll be able to equip all equipment at once because it kind of breaks sorry I was asking yeah so no I don't know if we'll ever make it so that you can equip everything at once because it was sort of goes against some of the design principles that we have for the equipment system but we do want to make some changes to the equivalent system we're not quite happy with it how it works right now, the fact that you can't equip the hover pack and the hazmat suit at the same time is a it's a pretty big oversight on our part and we will sort of we we are looking into solutions as it has to like fix that if that means that we'll add a new body slot or that we completely revamp the equipment system and make it different I can't say for sure because we haven't made any decisions yet so we will see we'll see
