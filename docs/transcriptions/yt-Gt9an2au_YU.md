> what will happen to the victims power lines after the event will they stay oh that is a good question I think the power lines will stay because the power lines is a separate building they're not an update to the power lines the power poles will switch back but I don't think the, lighted like the christmas lights power lines will change, but you won't be able to build new ones so enjoy them when they can, and but but one thing one one way to verify this is to, fake fights I mean fake lights I mean they are, one way you can test this by the way for everyone who's curious like what will persist and what won't is you can take your save file with all your your christmas stuff and then go back to main menu and then disable seasonal events and load the safely again and that's then you'll get a preview of what the, what what it will look like in the world once the event is over
