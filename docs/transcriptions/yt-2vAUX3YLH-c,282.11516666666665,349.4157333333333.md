> so you can place these stamps all over the map but another really cool thing with this is you can also do this in real time and like as you're running around so remember how if you hold alt and you left click you ping in the environment which by the way also show up on the map for other players, what you can also do now is if you hold alt and right click your you can place these stamps like in the environment, so for you here for instance a markup is a bear bush the stamp is placed and it will show up on the map here showcase like here here's the belly bush, and if you hold alt these stamps will like show up as you get close to them so they will be here in the environment so you know after you're roaming around you might see like a resource you want to use you can mark that'll be like oh here's a cool resource or maybe you see like a barrel bush you want to remember like so you can mark that out or if you run into like a cave that you want to explore at some point but you don't want to do it right now you can also leave a little mark here to say like oh here's a cave entrance and you know all these things will show up in the environment as you're running around but they will also show up on the map for you to take notice of the markers
