> is the plan to still combat most of the less common bugs closer to one point of release I play on dedicated server and the bugs recently have been fairly common it becomes quite frustrating but I do understand the limitations yeah so, actually I think I'm I'm actually working on a video about this kind of thing about bug prioritization which might come out this week by the way, and one of the things that I'll go into more depth in the video but one of the things is that for the most part the, wanting to wanting to fix all the small bugs and polishing all that sort of stuff will become more and more and more of a priority the closer to 1.0 that we get it doesn't make that much sense to do it now though, because it's just going to create unnecessary work that we'll have to undo and that's just going to break later anyway so we have to find this like this balance between pushing the game forward whilst also keeping it playable and that means that we must also accept that there's going to be some bugs in that process but as we get to towards 1.0 that's not necessarily the case anymore right like the interest of pushing the game forward to being a finished game is not really, an issue because we know what the finished game is, and so at that point stabilizing things and getting getting rid of all those little issues is going to become a bigger priority not only that but dedicated servers haven't gotten nearly as much time or attention as the rest of the game which does make sense but like we we still consider dedicated service to be in like an experimental State and so with that comes a little bit of instability but it is something that is going to get improvements for sure like that is planned, but our programs have been busy on other things for the meantime
