> will the server be multi-threaded like the incline so, I'm pretty sure so the multi-threaded thing for the dedicated servers I think that's a linux only issue correct me if I'm wrong chad because- I have I haven't seen anyone on windows having this issue that the threads that it's not like more than four threads but, it might be the case for both but even then, there's like hard limits in unreal engine we found that like kind of like caps for some reason we don't know why we're gonna look into that though, and- I don't know when we'll if when we'll push anything but we are going to look into that properly at some point there might be like some kind of like, mid fix coming soon ish we started looking into it today, with some just temp fix for this, but we are going to look into that at some point soon we just have so much else to work on at the same time but we are going to get around to it don't worry about it
