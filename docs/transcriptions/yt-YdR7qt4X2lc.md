### Transcript

> could there be some, creative or cheats most likely so with in Update 7 we've added the ability to support game modes and with that came, like passive mode or the retaliation mode where, creatures won't attack you unless you attack them first or the default mode where they're you know aggressive creatures are aggressive, and that's the groundwork for Creative for, game modes in the future and I think a creative mode is a very obvious one and I'm 99 sure that that's something that's going to come but it's it's something that we don't we we haven't wanted to work on, through the majority of development because we don't we don't necessarily want to encourage everyone to easily go into creative mode I know some people go get mods anyway and they can get something like that and that's fine if you go and jump through those Hoops to do that but we don't want to just give people a button to turn on creative mode if they're frustrated with the normal mode because we want you to be frustrated with the normal mode if it's frustrating so that you can tell us so that we can make it less frustrating you know what I mean so if we give creative mode too early we may miss out on a lot of feedback and I know that maybe comes at the cost of maybe the fun for some people so like who knows maybe it's a good decision maybe it's not but that's just the justification yeah but, creative mode is is an obvious, an obvious game mode I think that should be added personally
