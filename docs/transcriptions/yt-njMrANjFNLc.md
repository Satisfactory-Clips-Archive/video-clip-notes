> vr when, not by us that's for sure we're not gonna implement vr maybe we'll like give it to some other company at some point but I don't think we are like it's a it's not only a technical issue to solve it but also like ux like how that would work, and we we definitely don't want to tackle that 100 so we are not going to do that which probably means that it's not going to happen like if anything we're we're gonna look for console release first and that's also something that we're not sure is gonna happen ever so, like it's not looking good for vr would you be okay with unofficial vr mods yeah sure if if anybody wants a mod vr then go for it but we're not going to add that to the game
