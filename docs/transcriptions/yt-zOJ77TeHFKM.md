### Transcript

> yeah so now I remember I don't remember what I wanted to say so so la in two weeks ago I think we we made a video when we announced their release date and jace said that like you know like there are no recipes or no new manufacturing buildings so your save files should be fine like they're not going to break what why did you wait because it come back we need to publicly shame you or something I don't know we knew about it we made that video, there's one exception and that is the train stuff because yes you you will probably need to do some some fidgeting with, your train lines for them to work with update five yeah five I was like what number are we on, but but I would really recommend like holding off on like rebuilding everything until you have like the latest information from us, that's coming out on friday because there are still like even more if we were to talk about like what you need to do to get your saves working today we're still sort of like figuring out one or two things, that we're trying to like make it easier for you guys to work on, so like on friday well I'll think we'll have a better definite answer on those type of questions so then yeah that's one of the topics on the video where we'll go over like kind of what you need to do if you want to prepare for update five and make sure that everything works yeah in in my defense, -huh you know in my defense when I was filming the video right I was thinking of factory stuff so I didn't inten- I said a non-truth but I didn't mean to right and then, pointed it out like the day before I was like oh we shoot and re-edit yeah yeah but but so, I'm sure you guys can find it in your heart to forgive jace, and and like you know the thing that I was talking about was like will you have to repair your factory redo stuff is things going to be rebalanced is your efficiency going to be out of whack, other new parts that are or old parts that have been removed that's just going to hold up and freeze your entire factory lines that's kind of where my mind was at you know I don't think- I think you'll get that but you'll make fun of me I mean I sure did yeah, but yeah like like some people have pointed out here like if you don't have any train lines you're fine if you haven't got that part maybe if you only have one train you're also fine like then it's it's no issue whatsoever and if you have like, yeah I know the rest of your cases just wait for the video wait for the video yes we'll probably talk more about it next week and we can answer questions if you guys have any questions yeah so we can see what yeah exactly we can see what people are saying online after this friday's video and then talk more about some stuff so it should be good
