> there you go christmas is officially confirmed we are going to do fixmas again this year fixmas will start tomorrow proper the fixmas that's running right now is a deceiver this is not the it's not the true fiction an imposter an impossible yeah exactly yeah very successful proper fixmas and and, like i think the the plan is to have, the build with fixmas on, up in the next few hours and then when that happens for anyone in your time zone if it's if it's the first of december so folks in like australia for example it's probably already first of december then fixmes will begin at that time for for those folks okay so, yeah fix was starting pretty soon for many people i guess yes, and a couple of, just real quick like facts about fixmas in general so if you if you don't want to partake in fixmas if you if you don't care about fixmas there is a way to disable it if you go to the main menu there's a option in under gameplay i believe where it's like disable seasonal events we still didn't revert it's still like confusing that it's like the other way like disable enable whatever but, yeah you can disable it in the main menu and, can you and you can also disable it on dedicated servers it's a little bit tricky on dedicated servers because there's no main menu on dedicated servers, and we haven't put out that patch yet for that to be possible but there's gonna be in the next patch that's coming or maybe the patch is coming after that sometime soon there's going to be a startup launch parameter thingy that's dash disable seasonal events we will put that information on the wiki i think or somewhere you'll you'll see it same thing there you can disable seasonal events on dedicated service once that patch rolls out i believe we'll put that information in the patch notes once once it goes live, and, yeah the question on everyone's mind is like how so we only had like a couple of days to really prepare for fixmas so don't expect like any like major overhauls of fixmas there's a couple of new things there's a couple of really cool things actually in there that we managed to put together but overall the experience will be very similar to last year so you'll you'll you'll still have like a calendar that you can unlock things day by day, and good things will happen to us all now when it comes to specifically what's going to be in fixmas that's for you to find out and for me to not know to know yeah i kind of actually don't know all the things but, but yeah i've seen it i've seen a few other things and there's like a lot of there's a lot of really cool stuff actually pretty yeah for sure pretty impressed when i saw some of this yes for sure, and another really really really really important disclaimer here right if there's one thing that you pay attention to it's this thing okay, so the way we're rolling it last year we rolled out the entire fixmas, pretty much on the day when it started started i don't know why i pronounce it like that, and since this time around we didn't have that full time to like go through the whole like process you know that we usually do when when we quality assure all the the new content so not all the new content are gonna be like in the game from the get go i mean it wasn't gonna be anyways because you're unlocking it as you go but here's here's the big disclaimer right some people some people last year managed to find a little sneaky way to unlock things prematurely in in the fixmas calendar right i don't know how they did this and i don't know if we'll you know you guys you follow your heart you do what you want all right but here's the big disclaimer here right if you do that this year you're going to miss out on content and that's not because we want to like, punish you we don't like trying to punish you no no we're and it's not because we want to punish you for like doing anything like that we actually don't really care about that if you wanna if you wanna figure out a way to unlock stuff early i mean we're not gonna stop you it's it's you're playing the game the way you want but the the the ringer this year is because of that we can't, because we need to roll out more updates, and if you do sneak by and like manage to unlock things prematurely you won't be able to unlock them afterwards if we when we put them live, so so just so you guys know if you've if you yeah you dirty faceless cheaters if you find a way to to circumvent like the the regular progression in the calendar just know that if you do that you will miss out on content, yeah you'll be on the naughty list so, please share that information just know that, and everything will be handy dandy tldr don't time travel just don't just don't do it otherwise you might miss out on items okay santa can see you we haven't made all the items yet so don't don't time travel yeah and like we really don't want you to miss out on this content because it actually we're kind of super stoked about some of the later things so so yeah
