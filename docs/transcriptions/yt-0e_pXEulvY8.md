### Transcript

> there's a mod called the smart mod that makes basic building tasks like foundation's walls less time consuming by allowing you to build with a few clicks have you considered that for the game we have i'm considered, and people have, requested, things to help, building to be easier things like you know clicking and dragging foundations and things like that, but we intentionally don't do it like we don't actually want to do that kind of stuff so you know it's it it could be that like mark our director would look at that mod and maybe see maybe some parts of it would fit for our game some parts won't i don't know because i haven't seen the mod but, the thing that, yeah i mean i mean i've talked about this a lot before sort of why we we don't want everything to be easy, because it just changes the scale basically it moves the goal posts you know if it's if it's hard to build a thousand foundations then making something that's made of a thousand foundations is impressive right but if it's easy to build something with a thousand foundations then building something with a thousand foundations isn't impressive anymore or satisfying, and then bear in mind that the game already has performance issues right now so if you could build way bigger quicker you're like it's it's going to kind of it takes away on performance but then also on where the line is of what is satisfactory or satisfying gameplay yeah it's it's it's similar to the discussion with like remove biomass generators and just like but the the the thing that makes coal so satisfying is the fact that biomass was so tedious when i when i dismantled all the biomass burners in my in my game yesterday it it felt so good even knowing that i'm like you know if i mess up i'm going to need the biomass burners back again to restart the but just deleting them so i never have to look at them again yeah that was so good because it actually got to a point where probably 70 of my time was running around getting biomass, you know so getting away from that feels really good yeah yep that's not says to say like the game would be better or worse if we had some kind of like easy way to build stuff but it's it's it's like similar type situation and it's difficult to say what's what's right or wrong yeah but we are we are constantly evaluating that i'd say definitely it's it's something that you know that position could change in the future yes but currently apparently that's the way it looks
