> any plans for extreme weather that affects productivity it affects productivity never I don't that's that's part of like the video we put out a couple of weeks ago on a youtube channel like something that we don't want to ever add to the game is like any kind of maintenance aspect of the game, you know we already have fog exactly like, remember how much worse the fog was by the way you guys in the past you guys have it good right now with the fog okay I'm just saying, what was I talking about yeah so so weather effects is something that we always wanted to add to the game I think is really cool and I think we always felt that it was really cool we've had ideas in the past where like oh what if you know the more factories you put out in the the map it like rains acid rain or something like that and you have to maintain your factories but it's like a cool idea and concept but I don't think we like that and that's kind of like abandoned that idea, so, we've been, kind of like kind of putting our foot down and saying like no we're not gonna add that kind of stuff but weather effects could be cool in general for the game by itself just having like rain and stuff like that I think that would be really nice it's a nice little detail and it's something that we always wanted but it's it always gets like pushed because there's always like something more you know crucial to the game or whatever like it's it's kind of hard sometimes when you're working on games like this where you want to add so much polish to it but like it's hard to like define like where is the polish you know because the weather system is a huge task you know working on and making so, so, it's like it's a tricky balance there as to like what we would need to do minimum for it to be worth the hassle of doing it especially when we have so many else cool things everyone implements
