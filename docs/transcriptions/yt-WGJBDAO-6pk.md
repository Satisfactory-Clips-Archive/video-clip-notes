### Transcript

> will we be able to mirror, for example Refinery so we can finally get symmetrical mirroring setups this is something that you should definitely put in the QA site I haven't seen super big support for that internally at this stage but if you guys show more support who knows maybe maybe, I think it's I think it's a feature that if if you watch The Bugs video you'll you'll know that looking for good bang for our buck is really important and I think if we have an entire feature where you can mirror your buildings what we get for that is like a slightly more aesthetic build in some cases and nothing else but that's a lot of work and so it doesn't sound like a good bang for our buck in my opinion, and so I think that's a hard sell when there's other more critical things that are needed for sure but you can always suggest it if it's really really requested then maybe we can do it because if you guys really want something that factors into our decision making even if it makes a little less sense but if you guys are happier then maybe we'll do it
