> so you're saying you want an unhealthy crunch times with respect to the, the card development we're not we're not seeing that we're not saying that wait what was the question the, because we said like it's it's impressive that those games release at all yeah it is true in some cases it comes that at a cost yeah I don't I don't know which games have that cost necessarily but, we don't we don't really support that yeah it's hard to tell like if a game has like if people you know crunched on games because sometimes you read about like oh this game didn't have any overtime at all and it's like maybe that's true but it's all to tell because like even for developers sometimes they don't tell that they work overtime yeah, but I mean- I think I think it's impossible for developer to be like we have never done any of them I mean because it's like it's a weird range like if there's a difference between like one developer staying an extra hour because they're just like they're like stuck in their work like I really want to finish this right yeah and that is that is over time which is actually I would argue not actually a good thing to do, but you know but it goes anywhere from that all the way up to you know hey you don't have weekends for the next six months yeah right, that's and there's every shade in between and you're not getting compensated for that either yeah you get you get like pizza yeah yeah yeah we will buy you a pizza it's like I mean it's not good for my body yeah Jesus it's so it's it's so funny that that is like the common like we're gonna work late but I'm gonna buy you guys a pizza oh all right I'll do it for the pizza yes
