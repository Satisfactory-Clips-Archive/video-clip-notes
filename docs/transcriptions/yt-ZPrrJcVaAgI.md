> did you address the unobtainable power shard slugs probably not, we'll have to see in future map updates see if they get addressed but a lot of things when it comes to those power shards slugs, and also like floating rocks or floating, you know nut bushes and things like that, the the the the world design team intentionally doesn't fix those things, for the because one, of course you would probably like to get access to certain shards that are unobtainable right now and that's not intentional that they're unobtainable it is a bug for sure but, first of all it's not a rampant issue you probably have enough slugs for starters so the severity of that problem is not super high in our eyes the other thing is it makes no sense for us to do any of these changes when there's the potential for map changes to come in the future which will just make slugs unobtainable again or make nut bushes float again or rocks float again, so it's counterproductive for our world team like I've spoken about this it's counterproductive for them to go and around and hunt all these little tiny things which are absolutely annoying and not what we want but it's also quite frankly a bit of a bit of a waste of time for us to do this when map changes in the future we'll just recreate it again so they intend to go through all that stuff and do a big pause over it eventually once the world settles and then hopefully any unobtainable slugs and things like that will be in a better position and the issue will be addressed
