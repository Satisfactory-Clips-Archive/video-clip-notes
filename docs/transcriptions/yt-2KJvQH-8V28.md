> do you guys help some mod teams or are they at their own we actually do help them a little bit like sometimes they come to us and say like if we could have these things exposed or if things could be this way that would make things easy for us and we do accommodate them in some cases so we do actually work with mud team a little bit it's a tricky balance because we do want to have like official mod support at some point, yeah but sometimes it's like a smaller-ish kind of effort that we can do that's going to benefit them and therefore community use mods and so it's like good for us to do that, but if people in modding community like run into a wall then for sure we'll try to solve that we can't do everything at this point either
