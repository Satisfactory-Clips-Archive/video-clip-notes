### Transcript

> uh someone asked before can a train collide with itself like on a roundabout i assume so because i'm pretty sure we use actual just collision detection right so they can there you go and i don't have any more of the frequently asked questions i don't know if you have any preparedness in it but well this is this one more about these stations like why i saw some people ask about like why would you put uh signals at the start and end of the station could just couldn't just the station itself be right right right you know yeah yeah and the reason for that is because uh sometimes you might have more train carts than you have uh size of your station like if a station is three blocks and you have a train coming in that's like five blocks or something or five train cars then it's gonna stick out it's gonna stick out and you need to account for that when you're setting up the blocks because the blocks won't stop a train incoming train you know approaching the block if if there's not a signal there so you might end up with a case where like one train is stopping and it's like overlapping at the end of the block as another train approaches it's going to collide with that so you need to account for like your longest train when you're setting up the signals um to make sure that they're they fit within the block
