### Transcript

> drones oh sorry no yeah oh yeah and the drone port uh it's it's uh yeah it's less uh yeah it's a bit less to talk about but it's the same thing um with blocking blockouts this was essentially our first idea um we wanted to have a big drone control tower like a port uh you have the inputs and outputs on the bottom and then you have this tall thing um like having like a big majestic building to put up but as you all know we went from the left concept to the right one partly because it's just it's just more economic so it's less triangles uh it's uh less polycount and um less texture texture space etc but also um mostly because it gives players enough choices if they want to build a tower they can build a tower so um it's more of a platform so you can make it into whatever you want um so we decided to scrap the giant tower i remember a meeting i was in when mark and burke talked about this and i remember burping i remember who said it but someone was like why are they so tall it's like i don't know because it's cool yeah and it's a good reason yeah but i totally understand the thing where like yeah but if you make them modular in that sense then you can decide if you want them to be towers or not instead of them always being like a huge chunk of your factory in in certain senses and uh yeah and of course that's part of the concept art phase so if you want to be a concept artist prepare to get your work thrown out the window on a regular basis that's just part of it but that's just part of the process of reaching the best possible thing in the end for the product and which means for the player and having fun with it so uh yeah
