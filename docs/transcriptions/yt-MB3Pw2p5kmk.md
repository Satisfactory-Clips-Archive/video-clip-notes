> can we add destruction completed to crash sites what what is the, current plan for how to handle crest crash sites that you've already picked parts from I think that's on the back log, my fault has always been what if you could just dismantle it yeah I think internally even someone had a suggestion like what if you could just dismantle it and you could get some special resource from it that we could do something cool with I don't know what you would do with it, but definitely being able to dismantle it I think would be the easiest I mean it wouldn't be easy but it would be the most practical because I think that's the the main way that players would understand like I can just remove it like any other building in the game yeah more hub parts oh yeah dylan has gotta love that yeah yeah I think it's so funny that we haven't, fixed that up part issue but it's also like a mean at this point so whatever, but yeah I think that would be really cool because like there's there's a bunch of places where I see people building like the there's like a, well there's both it's both cool and and annoying where you have to like build your base around crash sites sometimes when you've you've set something big up and you're like ah it's gonna intersect with this this is kind of cool when people do builds when they do build around the world a little bit, so I don't know we'll see yeah I think so but I think that's mostly nice when it's like natural terrain and if it's like a ship that fell out of the sky that it's also from fixed it it doesn't have the same vibe to it yeah so I completely understand if people want to remove those, and generally it's just kind of nice to get things out of the way like it should be a player's decision to keep things that are in the way there for aesthetic reasons mm-hmm yeah being forced to do so it's not really fun I would say yeah here's a pretty interesting question oh sorry can I say the thing about, because we are gonna, no I think I know what you're about to say but we're saving that
