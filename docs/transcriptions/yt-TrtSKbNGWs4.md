> other plans for an indicator when a splitter merge is merger is actually connected to a conveyor belt because sometimes it builds onto the foundation instead of the belt, and I want to look at it yeah yeah you know what that's a pretty decent Point like that could be a good thing in general for a lot of things because I know that there's a common thing where it's like you think you've connected something and you haven't that's happened to me quite a few times I'm sure it's running to other people too the thing is though there are easy ways to to troubleshoot that and if you, if you keep that in mind while you're building then it's it's generally not too big of a problem but if you don't keep it in mind what you're building you might run into those issues and then they're really hard to troubleshoot especially after you've built like an entire Factory and it's like why is one thing not working it's not so bad with, conveyor belts because you can see things moving but sometimes it can be really problematic with like, pipes I mean maybe there could be maybe there could be a, some indicator to make things a little more obvious that's not out of the question my issues that I am connecting something but it's not moving parts that's interesting have you like reconnected all the parts around that like if you have if you have like a merger or something Have you like tried disconnecting everything from that and then like reconnecting everything and seeing if it works or maybe even deleting and replacing the merger that's strange that happens at all but you can always let us know on the QA side especially if it is happening now and then if you fix it you know you can still put in the QA side and let us know that it you know it was happening and then you fixed it that's still useful information for us
