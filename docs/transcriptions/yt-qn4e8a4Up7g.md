> if i spam lights from my factory die i don't think so because the lights are pooled we should we should make i'm going to make a video or something about this maybe in the future, about how the lights technically work because it's really interesting actually but the lights aren't like real lights in the world they're they're kind of cheated, and then we've done that in a way so that we can get still like the same kind of performance and the lights use a pooling system this is something as i've seen a lot of people in streamers specifically be a little bit confused about because they're not sure exactly, how the lights like pop in and out of the world but the lights are using something that's called a pooling system where you essentially like, you you create a bunch of memory or like create a bunch of data points, sensor stupid saying like that but i don't know how to explain it in a better way, you allocate a bunch of memory for the lights and then when you're playing you're like picking you know memory from that pool and then you know use it in the game and when you're like going far away from the lights and you don't need them anymore you put them back in the pool, five-year-olds okay yeah exactly, so there's a pooling system there's a bunch of pooling systems in the game, but that's one of the systems that we use for lights and that's why sometimes if if the pooling syst if the pool is empty we can't like add more lights to the scene and that's what some people are seeing sometimes if they have a lot of lights and they don't see like every light turn on after as they're like walking around that's because of that, i know that some people are like think that it's just distance or something like that but it's it's in like with this cooling system as well
