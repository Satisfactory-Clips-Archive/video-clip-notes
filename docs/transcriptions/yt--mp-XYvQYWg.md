> like to see a Quebec a rebalance as that we're encouraged to automate the production for each tier instead of just making the items by hand in early game this is a problem that we've had since day one for satisfactory and it's, it's a believe me we've tried a lot of different approaches to that problem and I think we still don't see a better option at the moment then sure handcrafting is is like op in the sense that like you're sort of giving players the ability to sort of skip all lots of stuff and they get stuck by that but we've tried so many different ways to get around that and they're all so annoying like the fact that that the best solution is a bad one it doesn't necessarily mean that I don't know what I want to say with this I think I think what I want to get out is like it is it is a much harder problem that I think a lot of people understand and it's a it's a problem that we worked years on and I'm not kidding like we spent the literally spending years on trying to solve that and we're still trying to solve that, but, yeah at the at this moment there's we don't see a good solution that doesn't introduce another big problem, essentially cool just, the the trick the the most optimal way to play satisfactory is to have like a party of people and just handcraft the entire game that's it speedrun there must be a well now I'm saying it we're like category for that just have like 16 people join a server and you have like two people running around and collecting items and the rest is handcraft and that's the game you can't handcraft the, the, space elevator Parts I guess that's the only one that you not have made but then you just handcraft and make the like they do in the speed run just make a bunch of assemblers to just make those parts and then you're good spacebar simulator exactly spacebar, category no portable miners allowed either oof oof that's a big oof because you can totally abuse the amount of like resources you get from the portable miners too because you can put down like an infinite amount of time but you can put down so many, portable Miners and produce so much more like resources from a single node that you can just with a regular Miner oof yeah can't wait to watch that speed run, handcraft only run exactly
