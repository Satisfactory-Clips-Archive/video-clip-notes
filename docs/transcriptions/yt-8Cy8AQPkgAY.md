> wait there was a will you ever consider VR for satisfactory I think this is another thing that like sure to be cool but it's going to be really hard to prioritize like when there are bugs and other features that everyone can enjoy, but instead we spend the time to make VR work and work well I'm not sure so this is another thing where it's like we could technically have it there so you could technically have a VR experience but maybe the The Experience isn't really like tailored to VR super well so it's not that great but you can kind of look you know and that might just be gimmicky and maybe who knows maybe that's enough but I think if we want to make features for the game we do kind of want to make them fully fleshed out and that would be a lot of time I think into making VR which wouldn't really push the game forward it would only help some people who play with VR to have some good experiences so it goes back to the bang for our buck situation and it doesn't really seem like a strong bang for our book at least but who knows like like from us as developers working on yeah that's kind of true and it's like [ __ ] yeah I love VR and I just want to make up like the dopest VR game ever like if we had someone like that that would do it in their in their period of time probably I know that there are one or two mods that have come pretty far that are really good but I don't know if there's any like finished mod that really like fully functions, for VR yeah because I've seen a couple of demos but yeah I have seen yeah I have seen some videos on some VR in satisfactory so it is a thing who knows you could you could Google around find these people see if they have something that you can, use you never know I could use more immersion yeah VR where you also need like three times better Hardware to be able to run the game VR games are [ __ ] like harder intense and then you play on Andrew say file and it's like you might as well look at a JPEG, have you heard have you heard that, Evanescence song
