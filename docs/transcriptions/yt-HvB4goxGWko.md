> do we get more than one custom swatch colors in the customizer, no plans to add more I don't think it's doable actually because the whole point of the customs watch is that it's unique and, you know it's it's like its own thing right and it doesn't I mean it's possible I guess but I don't know how that works exactly, because you can use the custom swatch to like just paint and then it will never change the instance when you change that color right, and I think it would break if we change that but maybe I'm wrong about that I missed the paint gun when all the swatches would because no no no no this is this system has this is the system has always existed in the game in fact there are there used to be less, swatches than there are now because now you also have the the factory ones at the top right so you have you've got there used to be 16 watches in the game or maybe there used to be 16 swatches whereas one was factory default, now there's 15 swatches that are like customized customizable and now there's also like the four factory ones at the top and then you have the custom swatch which is special because it doesn't actually keep an instance so you can essentially have as many colors as you want in the map so it's it's definitely a worse system it's definitely a better system than before like you can do more with it and you had more options too
