### Transcript

> let's see yeah mine under Mark III the big question don't think so for this update because like I said the the update is is a small update so it's mostly going to be minor things huh oh my God I caught myself as I said that, small things are gonna go into this update I think the the change with the miner is actually considered a major one because it ties into like if we do faster tiered belts or not which I still don't know if what we're doing there if we're doing that or if we're doing multiple outputs on the minor I don't know but, don't expect it for update seven update seven is probably gonna be more like a quarter of life you know maybe a cool thing here or there some new feature, little bits in there yeah so yes
