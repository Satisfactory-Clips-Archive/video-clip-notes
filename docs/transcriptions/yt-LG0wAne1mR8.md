> do you guys like how hypertubes turned out where everyone spammed entrances to gain speed is there uh are there any plans to implement an actual feature for this so my understanding is that uh mark is happy with people doing that like that wasn't really the plan but you know there is sort of a trade-off for it it's finicky it's not always like easy to set up um accurately you know extra power is required um so like if you want to do it like fine but i think that we're also actually happy with just how they work normally too that they do kind of get you around the world as you need them too so i'm not sure if there's much more work coming to hypertubes in the future if the question is specifically if you cannot like nerf it or remove it then we don't have any plans for that right now right now it's just like a happy little accident that people figured out the hypertube cannon stuff yeah we sort of also enabled a little bit more because uh there used to be an issue in the game where we didn't load in like simple collision for unloaded tiles in the game so if you did shoot off in the in the world which wasn't something we expected people to do you wouldn't fall through the planet anymore and i believe we did that after we noticed that people were doing the hypertube cannon stuff because people would just like shoot into uh infinity oh yeah unhealthy
