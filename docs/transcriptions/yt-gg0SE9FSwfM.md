> how many more tiers are planned in future development I don't think we have any like planned amount of tiers necessarily I think we, I think the way we kind of see it more so is like what do we want to get out of the game and sort of, in what shape or form does that like come in so for instance when we introduced tier seven and eight in update four the the reasoning wasn't necessarily like oh we need to add more tier like we we need to add one more tier because no the thing was that we felt that like when before update four and update three the late tier stuff was like kind of complex and it kind of come became complex immediately like there was no good ramp up, so like nuclear stuff and like you need a ton of refineries you cannot still do, but everything was very like overwhelming immediately so instead of like us in those cases think okay we need to add more stuff we need to add in a second tier without a thought as like okay this is too complex too fast we need like we need a intermediate step before we can add like more complex recipes so we kind of like shifted so the stuff that we had in tier six we kind of moved some things down so you would unlock that earlier I believe if I remember correctly and we then added like an additional complexity in tier seven and eight, that was introduced in update four so the approach isn't necessarily always that like oh we need to add more tiers rather the approach is that we need to do what makes sense for the game and like the balancing and all that jazz, and you know that's sort of the approach we go instead for that
