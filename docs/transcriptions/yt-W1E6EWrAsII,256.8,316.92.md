### Transcript

> the game in single-player without the need for a server or anything like that in multiplayer we officially support one to four players but we're probably not going to limit that at least at first so you can just like add people and just kind of see what happens as full privacy settings on the servers it is currently limited to friends who can just any friend can just join your server or private where people can join via invitations we probably going to have public setting at the moment because that can easily be grief or assignment as your dedicated service it's something that we really want in the game whether that's gonna be for the Alpha or later and it's something that we've kept in mind during development so hopefully it should be easy to add into the game when we when we do do it but it hasn't been tested extensively yet so we can't promise dedicated servers at this stage
