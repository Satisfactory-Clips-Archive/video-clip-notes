> General multiplayer stuff You can play the game in single-player without the need for a server or anything like that. In multiplayer we officially support 1 to 4 players but we're probably not going to limit that at least at first so you can just like add people and just kind of see what happens. As for privacy settings on the servers; It is currently limited to friends who can just, any friend can just join your server ...or ... Private where people can join via invitations. We probably won't have public setting at the moment because that can easily be griefed, or ... &quot;Simoned&quot; ... As for dedicated servers, it's something that we really want in the game whether that's gonna be for the Alpha or later ... and ...

So we can't promise dedicated servers at this stage, but personally I'm pretty optimistic about it. Is the map procedurally generated? Will there be procedurally generated resource locations?
