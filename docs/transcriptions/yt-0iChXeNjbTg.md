### Transcript

> later started talking to me when I come across stem ores and the whip artifact sure those lines be muted now that's normal that she speaks there's some creepy stuff yeah Harvest Harvest there's definitely I think a bug where the distance is like a like you hear the voiceless a lot further away now and I don't know if that's intentional or not oh maybe that's a book but I don't know comply there's definitely cases too where if you're like building on top of a cave, and like there's a there's something at the top of the cave or something like that and you're standing above it you'll hear the voicemail because you're in proximity of it and you'll be like what why am I hearing Ada talk to me when there's like nothing close to me that was also a bit confusing she's lonely she just wants a friend exactly
