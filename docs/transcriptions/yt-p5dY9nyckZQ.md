> as for the wiki video last week, some you some folks were you you you tell you yes so so if you didn't know we put out a video last week on our youtube channel with, where me and jace kind of like just want to highlight the wiki people like there's a lot of effort that goes into the wiki I really hope that that came across as well that like this is really that we're not like nitpicking on like issues or not issues but like incorrect stuff on the wiki we tried to like just help out, because yeah the wiki is amazing and you know as far as we see it it's it's an official wiki like it is it is super up to date it has a lot of good information for new new players and and you know for beginners and intermediates and advanced players like there's a lot of stuff yeah big big applause to the wiki people, and in the video we also talked a little bit about some of the unreleased content that's like listed on the wiki that they've like either we've pushed accidentally to the game where that was data mined from the game, and just to clarify also on that segment is that like those are things that you know probably will won't make it to the game a lot of people saw it as like oh cool these are things that are coming they just haven't finished yet but no those are like pending for you know possibly never coming back yeah these are things that were accidentally left in the game but were removed yeah, some might come back some might not, I think if you watch the video you'll see that there's you know you'll see the remnants of like some old stuff that was removed, that has now made its way in for example the particle accelerator previously known as the hadron collider so you know that sometimes happens but not all of it happens yeah so yeah marked rifle confirmed yes we'll make it even worse than the last time mark ii rifle and it's like less less ammo it does less damage

> I mean that one that was the other one was the reaper the rebar scatterer gun or whatever it was called yeah the rebus got a gun yeah I really wanted to make a new one each time or something like how do you know that worked yeah that's so weird, so yeah I just wanted to clarify that that you know that segment doesn't mean anything really it's just fun to talk about and showcase, so yeah
