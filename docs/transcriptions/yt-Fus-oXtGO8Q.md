### Transcript

> do you guys work from home, I work from I used to work from home, through the pandemic but I recently started working at the office however I record from home, Snoop works from home as far as I know yes but hopefully not soon I'll be in a different office yep you prefer working from home or in the office, for me it's like I have a two-hour commute it's pretty nice to be in the office but I am like my performance is I'm I'm I work so much better when I'm at home, rather than when I'm at an office so, home for me definitely but I do like wish I miss like meeting people from time to time and like you know doing stuff physically, you know recording videos or whatever, yeah I, yeah I started going back to work and- I don't know what I prefer but I think going back to work has actually been pretty good for me in the way that I've done it anyway so that's good there's definitely an aspect when you're making videos there's definitely an aspect of it's nice to not have to like it's very distracting when there's a lot of stuff going on around you when you're recording a video at least for me I prefer recording from home for sure so it's definitely easy to record from home yeah we were thinking of putting together like a studio that at the office so we'll have all the equipment there set up you know PC in the room with all the stream stuff ready to go and so it'll be really really easy to record videos there so maybe that'll be a thing but for now I really like recording videos, at home personally I really like not having people around me because one thing that so if you guys remember where my, our previous videos used to be made right they used to be at my excuse me I'm streaming they, they used to be just at my desk in the office on the Upper Floor and down below me there'd be people up there they could hear me talking while I'm doing the video there's people around me and sometimes I'm having a bad day with the script and it would get into my head and like it would be really frustrating for me and then I'm getting frustrated around other people that makes it even more frustrating for me because I'm embarrassed because I'm frustrated it's just honestly people like walking in on the floor and they're stopping like oh you're gonna take and then no it just just walk like oh okay, like that also happens all the time yeah yeah that happens too, yeah it's it it really it really messes with things I find personally so, yeah I don't I don't really want to go back and film in a random place in the office anymore unless it's a special occasion, but if we can get like a like a dedicated room for it would maybe make it easier otherwise they'll like stream from home I think I have a nice home as well so you get a nice nice backdrop here yeah portal last of us we get doggo
