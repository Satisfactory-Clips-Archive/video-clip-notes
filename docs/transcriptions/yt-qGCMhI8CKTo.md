> would you consider adding a little bit of terraform to the game I mean we have considered it in fact, wait no we haven't but, we I'm sure we have we've probably known about it and then and then immediately thought no we're not gonna do that yeah, and so basically I don't think that that's the thing that's going to be in the game any time soon I think there's a very good chance that it'll never be in the game I mean I don't see any the way that we built it right now I don't see any way we could do it right now I don't I don't see how we do it yeah and and even if there was a way to do it I don't see how we're going to put the time in to that before 1.0 I love the phrasing too just a little bit of terraforming it's just a little bit it's a tiny bit if you do a little bit you can do more yeah like the hard the hard part is doing a little bit yeah the hard part is doing it a little bit at all yeah yeah yeah exactly getting any of it all working is is like 90 of the work
