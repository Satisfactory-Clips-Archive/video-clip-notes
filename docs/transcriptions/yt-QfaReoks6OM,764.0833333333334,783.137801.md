### Transcript

> There's also
been an update in how the timetables work. You can now create some basic logic
for what your train should do when it stops at any given station. So you might have a train only stop
for a limited amount of time, or wait until it's fully loaded. And you can also control what resources
it should load or unload. This can aid in managing congestion
on your train lines. Oh, hey Snutt! I found the ball!
