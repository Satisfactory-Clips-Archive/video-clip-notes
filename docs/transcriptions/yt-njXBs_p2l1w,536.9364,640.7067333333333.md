> we didn't leak anything all right we didn't we didn't leak it all right people out there are saying that we leaked something we didn't leak the thing there was a there's items different items in the advent calendar okay and one of them many of them are cool we didn't leak it we put it there on purpose all right jesus hey everyone my name is jason community manager coffee stain studios and today i'm going to be talking to you all about the new parts or some of the new parts coming in update four so i'm gonna unveil some of those for you today very exciting but before we get into that i want to talk about the engine upgrade which has not come out yet we made a video about that um like two weeks ago put it in the cards up here yeah so we we haven't uh pushed that out yet there's still some issues some crashes on starting the game right now which is kind of unfortunate but once that big crash gets out of the way i think we're good and then i think we can push it but yeah that's not out yet but uh hopefully soon second of all i just want to do a reminder that we have a merch store by the way we haven't uh i haven't uh talked about it much on the um on these videos but we do it's uh for fans by fans dot com slash fandom satisfactory i think that's the correct url it's in the description below and we sell uh official merch there as well as merch designed by community members who had you know one as part of the uh fan forge contest that we hold there sometimes so yeah you can buy some merch there however shipping's a little blair for those folks outside of north america and we are working on a better solution for folks in the eu and other parts of the world as well but we don't have one yet you know still check it out but uh just check check check the shipping that's maybe a little much yeah we'll do something about that soon anyway let's get into this video alright so today i'm going to be showing you some parts not all the parts coming in update for but some of them i'm not going to go into necessarily what they do i'm not going to go into the recipes that build them up yet i kind of just want to introduce them to you like look there's new stuff this is what they look like this is what they're called i'm going to show you the description that they have in the game have a look at what their concepts are and things like that and just look at some new things and hopefully you'll enjoy that so if you do please let us know by smash and like and writing in the comments thanks jace helps me a lot cool let's go okay so welcome to this little factory this is the factory that creates all of the new parts this is how the parts are made in a coffee stain okay so we run them through our little factory here and then we ship them out to your pc okay so this is how this works so welcome to the factory it's on my own kind of level so the lighting's a little bit different it's a little bit you know a little bit whatever out there but it's uh it's something okay so first of all we're gonna take the factory cart to the first room whoop there okay so we're gonna take the factory cart to our first location we're here okay um all right let's take a look at what we're looking here so let's cross over to the concept art and see what we're looking at okay so the first two things that we're looking at is the aluminum solution first of all and then also the uh sulfuric acid um but you know we've had sulfuric acid in aluminum solution in the game for a while now but now they are packageable so these are new parts you can now package these things yeah so there's not too much especially look at here you know aluminum solution not fit for human consumption sulfuric acid not fit for human touching no touchy okay don't do it so package sulfuric acid and aluminum solution and this is what they look like in game we can see them on the conveyor belts and they're uh in their beautiful form and forgive the lighting this is my own shitty universe okay bad lighting but this is what they look like how how big they are okay okay so we can pick these up let's take a look in the inventory package sulfuric acid has a little little little apostrophe thingy in there that needs to go away that may be that may have actually just been me typing that in that was i think that's actually my fault anyway whatever so sulfuric acid packaged for alternative transports what was that christmas presents okay and then so then let's take a look at the description here illumina solution packaged for alternative transport nothing too fancy nothing too fancy so we can move on to the next one from here so we can get back into our little cart okay and then we'll drive to the next room we're here okay so here we have something new aluminum casing let's check out the concept art all right so this is the i said aluminum casing aluminium casing by the way the eye is there as you can see uh yeah so it's just um plain aluminium you can see some rubber padding there you know for safety's sake right yeah i guess based sort of on your uh pc cases and some uh cool stuff like this so basic component for high tier stuff says the art director i'm sure so does everyone else they they probably all agree i think we're all in agreement that this is actually the case cool so let's take a look in game there it is that's what it looks like we can duck down we can duck and weave check it all out this is this is them in motion look at these bad boys in motion very nice aluminium casing i also have a note here that these casings will be made from aluminium ingots all right now i know i said i'm not going to give you any recipes or anything like that but this is just a [ __ ] aluminium case it says aluminum casing hi okay cool so uh we can read the description i guess take a look this is the icon in the menu aluminium casing a versatile container casted from aluminium ingots easy peasy cool let's get on to the next part all right let's get in the car we got a little bit of a way to drive this time and we're here the next one is plutonium waste you guys oh my god it's nuclear stuff plutonium waste what does it mean what could it mean here's a little reference image here still not sturdy enough apparently low and apparently it is more compact than the regular nuclear waste interesting interesting difference in size but it is sturdier just not strong enough though plutonium waste very exciting movement on the nuclear side of things and you know we did sort of tim our our previous producer accidentally leaked nuclear changes coming on stream a couple weeks ago and then we talked about it also last week so uh here you are this is a new part related to that i'm not gonna say too much more about the plutonium waste because a lot of people already have some of their own um like conspiracy theories as to what's gonna happen with nuclear and then by showing this you're gonna have even more theories some are correct some are very wrong so uh they're always fun to see and and i kind of like not just me but we all like watching people get really passionate about what they think is coming so um i'm gonna say nothing more about this uh let's let's pick it up though let's pick it up and take a look at the description the toning waste is the byproducts of consuming plutonium fuel rods handle with caution extremely radioactive and this extremely radioactive is true i've turned the radiation off right now uh and it was very strong and you die very quickly if it's around you so uh yeah you want to be careful with the plutonium so this is what it looks like first little blue crap just coming out there very cool all right plutonium waste let's move on to the next one all right this one's actually a really long drive um let's take a while we're there okay cool let's look at the uh let's look at the the concept art so the next one is magnetic field generator and this is as you can see here it is a project assembly part so this is project part number six magnetic field generator we'll read the description about it a little bit later but it looks very cool looks like it connects so you make multiple of them and they connect together interesting interesting generates a magnetic field i assume so let's take a look at it in game nice i like this one this one looks cool i just want to i just want to plug them end on end kind of some human centipede

> except they're magnetic field generators instead all right so we can see inside very interesting let's pick this one up let's read the description project part number six send up to the space elevator i assume to complete phases of project assembly that's what the project parts do these modular generators use superconducting magnets and vast amounts of electricity to produce an easily expandable and powerful magnetic field so expandable and powerful magnetic field interesting very interesting yo the recipes right there by the way i don't know if we're showing the recipe but it's right there so are we are we blocking this out is it not being blocked out who knows because it's right there so that's cool there they are let's go into the next one all right so next up we have project part number seven which is gonna give you all the project parts it would seem so this is the uh assembly director system as you can see so it's also another project assembly part very cool kind of looks like glados not gonna lie a little bit like glados so um that's a fun fact so let's go take a look at it in game all right we're here we're here

> scammed this is walmart assembly directory system over here we got scammed you guys this doesn't match all right so the deal there is the model for this part isn't actually done so we have some weird ass placeholder for now that's what we're using but uh what it will look like is it will look like this and we just don't have that ready yet so you know this is a thing that happens in games sometimes your models aren't done you've got to get them done but sometimes just knowing about the parts existence is cool too even if you don't have the final model right guys cool so let's talk about it yeah so let's pick it up see what the description says wrong wrong model here too so they're gonna get an update project part number seven sent up to the space elevator to complete the phases of project assembly this extremely fast and precise computing system is specifically designed to direct the project project assembly assembly phase very nice name so extremely fast and precise computing system is specifically designed to direct the project assembly assembly phase all right so like a little ai thingy i guess what does it mean put your theories in the the description below the comments below comment away okay so we got that one all right we're going to the final one you guys let's check out the concept art thermal propulsion rockets project assembly part number eight this is our last part for the day and uh it's a big old rocket this is the butthole of it this is the butthole this is the front and that's the butt as you can see it says butt here it says butthole arrow pointing at at the butthole okay let's go take a look right here all right they look cool don't they fancy lights lens flare on your face from these lights by the way very thermal propulsion rocket they look nice on the conveyor belt very cool this is the front here there's the butthole cool let's pick it up okay so thermal propulsion rocket project part number eight send up the space elevator to complete phases the project assembly uses extreme heat to produce the high pressure plasma required to get project assembly into motion reduce the high pressure plasma requires your project assembly into motion so project assembly motions huh who'd have thunk it not me uh yeah okay so they're all the parts that i'm gonna show off for you today it's not like super that many of them but i hope that it was still interesting i hope this is still a fun video for you and i hope this sort of keeps you going for a little longer while we continue to work on update four we love seeing all of your theories conspiracy theories awesome little theories they're all really cool everyone loves reading them whether they're right or wrong uh yeah so i hope this uh was fun and if it was uh smash like and write in the comments it was fun jace then i'll know that you made it this far in the video and that you found it fun i believe next week we will have a q a video and that will be my last video for the year so i'll see you next week with a q a bye
