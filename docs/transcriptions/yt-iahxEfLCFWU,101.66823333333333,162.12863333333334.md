> so yeah this is the packager building
> this bad boy can pack and unpack so many
> liquids and
> this replaces the packaging
> functionality that we've had in
> refineries up until this point
> as we didn't have enough time for update
> 3 to make a new building to handle that
> we're adding it now as prompted by
> community request
> and the difference being that the
> packager is a much smaller building and
> it consumes less power
> 10 megawatts to be precise and it fits
> perfectly on a single foundation and is
> less than three walls high
> how about that huh the package is the
> first building
> to have inputs and outputs above one
> another and this is to reduce all the
> criss-crossing of belts and pipes while
> setting up like a large row of them
> and it's a bit of a test case for us so
> please make sure to let us know if you
> like this or not
> now if you've already set up any
> refineries to handle packaging and
> unpackaging
> don't worry because any legacy refinings
> built in the game will still function
> like before
> but you will not be able to select these
> recipes in any
> refineries constructed from this point
