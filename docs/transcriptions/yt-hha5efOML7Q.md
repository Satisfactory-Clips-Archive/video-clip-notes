> can you tell us when your plan on, giving us a day for update 8 no the date for update but a date for when you will give you a date for when we'll announce a date for when we'll announce a date for update 8., no but for real though, it is fairly soon that we can start dropping some more information I would say probably nothing in the next couple weeks maybe y'all will get more information we can't I can't say that you will for sure but I'm pretty sure that within the month you can say that we're kind of in pre-production of making sort of the the stuff that we do at least you know for the content that we put out we're sort of in that pre-production stage right now where we're planning what kind of content we're gonna put out and how we're gonna announce things Etc we've sort of mixed it up a little bit between updates you know like with update six for instance we dropped everything from the get-go with update seven I think we did a little bit differently so that's kind of we're in the face right now where we're planning sort of how we drop information and announcements and stuff like that so I mean that's that's a thing I guess yep
