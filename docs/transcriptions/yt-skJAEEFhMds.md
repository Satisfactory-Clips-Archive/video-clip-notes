> any new planned game modes aside of, well the the one plan game mode that we know is coming in update seven is pass passive mode or peaceful mode, where you can toggle off like creatures will attack you or stuff like that, and we might do more with that in the future too because right now it's just going to be like a kind of bare bones release of game modes, with like the the the menu system and like the functionality of it by itself and, like like I said we're adding peaceful mode and then in future we might add so that like you can toggle on and off if like if you like attack a creature maybe it will attack you stuff like that you know various degrees of peaceful mode, we're not doing creative mode just yet because we feel like it's it's a bit too early to do that because we still need feedback on like the general balancing of the game there's still a couple of things that we want to balance in general for the game and we feel like it will muddle the water a bit if we you know have creative mode but also get like feedback on the game where creative mode is like has been used so that's why we haven't added it we are going to add creative mode at some point yeah for sure it might sound counterintuitive since they're like already mods that kind of do that but like the point is is that we don't want to we don't want to encourage literally everyone with the game took out a play in creative mode yeah when we still need this other feedback you can do whatever you want with monster foreign we don't talk about that they live their own life we do though I would say we don't talk about that is the touchy thing no we love our modern Community we would like to have a full modding support as well at some point yeah yeah we still get we certain messages sometimes from people like what do you think about money Community yeah that's good yeah- I don't get I don't really understand why some game companies are against it I can understand it in some competitive yeah I guess there's a problem there maybe there's some like Financial thing where like maybe if you have like a online competitive game like other people making content that they can sell or whatever I don't know it's like for my brain yeah I don't know but we're kind of lucky I mean we're looking in a lot of ways with satisfactory because it's like it's not a competitive game it's it is a co-op game so it's online but like we don't care if people like cheat in it or whatever because like you're only affecting your own play time and like I don't feel like if you're if your friend cheats let's talk to your friend about it yeah exactly like why should we why should we like enforce how to play the game in a way yeah I know I've seen a lot of discussions about this as well online where people are like yeah but that's not how the game is designed you shouldn't like ruin and sure you can have that mindset- I definitely have that mindset sometimes when I play games where like no I don't want to use this mod because like I kind of I know that someone spent a lot of time thinking about this and designing the game in this specific way so like I want to get that experience but that's at least at least my choice then you know yeah that's not everyone plays that way yeah I'm kind of like that as well yeah some people Some people prefer the vanilla playthrough you just want to experience it the way that they crafted it some people don't yeah and, some cases people the only valid way to play this game is my way good one Mezza exactly
