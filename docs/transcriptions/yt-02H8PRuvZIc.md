> because they never can, consider having community contributed code for the game, no because there's a there's a little problem with it when it comes to licensing, even if we wanted to make a open well there are like ways to get around it but a pretty significant problem is like even if we wanted to have an open source game like unreal engine or unreal tournament for instance is open dev, it's so much work handling that it's it's honestly like more work than it is for us to just make the game, how's that how's that message which one was it yes i love it i love it, oh the crab you're the crab oh little crab how did you do that crap oh it's just an emote like it's just emoji text it's better tv crab is it no it's not yeah it is oh then we can't use it then right well we can't use it but, it looks like it's just crab emoji text now we'll just do we'll do that one that we've got oh maybe it's better ttv that's just like overt like super saiyan factory no yeah we we we definitely we i feel like we don't want to do open dev, or like community community with code because we we have enough on our plates to deal with our own code and, we kind of lose out a little bit on that i feel like, but there's also licensing issues with the engine we'd have to distribute crab colon like the engine and stuff like that so people would be able to access everything so it it's it would be a licensing nightmare for us too
