### Transcript

> did i miss something about the steam deck support i don't know we haven't said anything about this so when is the steam deck gonna come out like officially because one thing i can tell you guys right now is that we probably won't be able to verify the game um to be steam deck verified or whatever before the game hits before the steam deck is released february 25 so okay so it's on friday yeah so so the the main crux when it comes to the to have like a game being verified on steam deck is you have to have full controller support which obviously we don't have right now we have like somewhat controller support but we're not like fully control the support right and you also need to support the full uh rendering display of the steam deck so like render it in in the full whatever this resolution uh something something i can't remember where it is but uh which like the game can do but it doesn't run well when you do it that way and we feel like you know we need to sort of do special things 12 by 1280 by 800 that's a very specific one yeah but that's the one so uh we would need to be able to like render the game at that resolution at all times and that's not something that like out of the box we we're getting we can't we we're getting one resolution but i'm not sure if that's the full one and ui elements have to scale with that resolution and stuff like that and that's also like a lot of work needs to be put into that and that's not something we we're going to be able to do uh in three days so um but um yeah not with attitude but as to as for like whether or not we will support that in the future we don't know at this point because it's part of like the planning that we're doing so you know when we know we will let you guys know
