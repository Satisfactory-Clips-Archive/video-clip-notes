> will you ever add a copy and paste function for factory buildings that way we could make massive production array a lot faster no that's something that we don't want to do for a couple of reasons one reason is because it would be it would kind of like take away what we think is the fun aspect of the game like we we sort of like we've been having this discussion a lot back and forth internally and the the thing with like our game we feel like is is if you compare it to like other games like minecraft and stuff like that is that if you make it too like easy and seamless then you're kind of like optimizing away the fun out of it and that's something that we don't want to do, even with like foundations we sort of like we're on the fence for a long time but I think we we settled on the fact that like, when we added zooping we kind of settled on the fact that like okay for foundations it's fine because foundations aren't like that's something that you actually do build a lot of whereas with factory buildings not so much like you're not building as many factory buildings as you're building foundation blocks because if you are then you're gonna run to the other issue which is like technical limitations of the game itself and the engine because factory buildings are much more expensive to build in terms of memory storage, memory usage, with the game and when it comes to garbage collection specifically for memory management that's something that like you'll hit like a memory image memory limit, much sooner so we're kind of like scared of of letting you guys be able to do that because of that limitation, there is a mod for it and you know when it comes to modding like we're we're okay with that because then you're kind of like on your own but you know when it comes to making the game for us we sort of have this like responsibility to make sure that the game is you know holds a certain, standard of quality, and we feel that like if we're pushing moving the goal post all the time and making it easy and easier to build too much we're both taking away the fun of the game that we think is fun of the game, and you know nudging on that issue, so yes oh wait I just realized something oh I think I got jace's feed working and wait he's not there he's just gone you just dip is this just like a ruse for him to dip from stream I can't believe this wow unbelievable all right anyways, so yeah we'll
