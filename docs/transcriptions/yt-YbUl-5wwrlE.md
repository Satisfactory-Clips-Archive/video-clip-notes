### Transcript

> yeah and, and i guess the the the last big thing to mention here maybe is that, last week we revealed the date for early access which is going to be next week tuesday on november 23rd that's when we believe we will and i still say believe because anything can happen but that's when we're aiming yeah that's when we're aiming to release the stuff for early access, so that y'all can try it out if you've been cautious which you know all right like nothing wrong with being cautious with our game okay like that's that's how i feel so, so yeah that's super exciting, and then update five will be out for everyone yeah and, we will be even when update 5 is sort of out on on like the the stable branch and all that we'll probably do like a few patches here and there still and dedicated servers will also kind of like keep we'll keep working on those because they're not going to be like like finished in a good state for update five when update five is out on early access so to speak we're gonna keep working on that, so, yeah some development i mean we're gonna keep working on the game overall too so but yeah dedicated servers will get more like updates than the rest of the game after we're yeah that's it and the other thing is like with the, we sort of talked about this a little today, like with the early access release, it is possible that that comes out with some bugs still in it but then the the the thought then is to then also still fix those bugs just because it comes out in early access doesn't mean we're not gonna make any fixes right but like one of the things that we sort of keep in mind is like is it in a state where it's like think of the people on early access right now where they're missing all of these features is it in a state where it is like quite good quite solid for most people and, to the point that it's like it's it's a worthwhile upgrade for those folks you know that's something that we sort of balance as well, with the decision making so even though like it might come out there might still be some bugs we'll still fix the bugs you know the game is in early access right so like we're still working on it, but yeah the question is like is it in a is it in a state where it's it's gonna be good for the others that don't have access to all these features yet, so just just keep that in mind like, if if the game does we do push to early access next week and you know we're constantly reevaluating whether or not like that's actually a good idea and and like what issues are still there and the severity of them but like the goal is like still to to get it out so that it's quite solid and then we'll still be fixing issues yeah yeah and i mean that's repeated myself like three times that's fine and i mean that's kind of the nature of early access right we won't be able to fix everything you know all the bugs in the game when we release the the stable like when we release update 5 to the stable version because we need to keep working on the game too yeah so yeah yeah the the others i say the others because i kind of just assume most people who come to stream play experimental i don't know is that like i don't know if that's a good assumption or not but but i mean the folks who aren't playing on update five is who i'm talking about of course it sounds so funny i was like yeah the other people the the i was going to dish a dish on the experimental people but i'll always like that anyway
