> hey everyone my name is Jace I'm a community manager coffee stain studios today is gonna be a really cool episode we're gonna be talking to Simon everyone loves Simon we're gonna be talking to Simon about what he does which is visual effects and all this stuff so you're gonna see a lot of cool stuff how he does some of the stuff that he does and maybe some things that you haven't noticed before or upcoming things I'm not sure that he'll tell us a couple just housekeeping things a lot of people still asking about when is Stephen gonna come out so nothing has changed it's gonna be coming out sometime in May mazing like when this goes out it's gonna be like one day it'll be tomorrow that's May it won't be out tomorrow though think mid to late May I guess is a better guess there but but we're pretty confident actually we we don't really think we need to delay yet but you know anything can change all right so let's just jump into the video so Simon unmute yourself and welcome to the video yo yo yo Simon's rap album will be dropping in about a couple of months so yeah how you doing today man are you well yeah I'm doing fine thank you it's like it's a bit warm you know it's good it's good I say that all the time though cuz Simon is like he's like this like jacked up dude and he's like a furnace and it's like middle of winter and he's telling us it so worried it is really warm actually like the song is on my my [ __ ] windows okay yeah I'm going to try not to swear as much also yeah well you do well so some of you may or may not know who Simon is beside but is a is a bit of a meme within our community as well if you don't know why you can look at the I'll put a card thing up here if I remember there's a hole Simon saga series that we made before the early access version of the game drugs so you can check that out how does it feel being a meme Simon you know I've done something in my life it feels good yeah you finally achieve something yeah it's like it's it's fun to watch all the memes that people do yeah but yeah I just people's love reading like comments about it yeah yeah people really love you so that's really cool and today they actually good to see that you do things yeah hopefully right hope it's not I mean like there's a lot of stuff that I actually don't know what Simon's gonna be showing I think I know a couple things but I've intentionally wanted to not notice that I can have a genuine reaction and asked genuine questions but I think a lot of people don't really know what you do and it's gonna be really nice to show that yeah yeah I Q not just a meme yeah could you okay so if you we've got on a little bit if you could just say a little bit about yourself and what you do and then we'll get straight into it yeah so my name is Lyman and I do the visual effects and satisfactory so and [ __ ] no no no Jase no no okay can we [ __ ] I'm not editing this dude I don't have much time oh okay I do the VFX I'm gonna show you some of the effects okay okay that's alright if you used to do technical art stuff so like some yeah like visual or like optimizations on models and stuff is that correct or work yeah yeah that's true so I've been doing the effects for I don't know how long like six months or something before commencing I guess it's it's really fun I really love it so yeah cool I like to learn new things yeah you do you spend a lot of your time your personal time learning new things yeah I'm just a nerd just a nerd yeah yeah we asked him to come out and hang out he's like I'm just gonna go and sit down with no more programs in all right it's fun it's fun yeah that's good alright so let's take a look huh yeah I can what are you showing us first I've prepared some things okay I'm gonna show you an explosion from the noblest better run of thing yes everybody loves them me too so this is how it looks like this if I play it yeah so if you this is how it looks for me like when I'm working with it so I have all these things here is different emitters that spawn sprites particle sprites and you can like add textures to them or color and change all these parameters but I can we can I break it down or something so yeah sure sure sure if you can see this this is like if you can see the debrief eying around and then to this I add sparks suggests you add it in steps right so I have a Forex sparks of debris Sparks and debris so far and I can't really say this but this is a light so if it were closer to ground it would lift up the ground as well okay and then we have a dome so it gives this so cool thing around there you can't really like see it if you look at the effects like altogether but it's there and it makes it helps just make the whole thing come together and then I'm adding some fire this is some fire to it and this is like a fire see if I can show you this it looks like this it's a it's a sprite sheet right oh yeah yeah yeah so and and this and these sprite sheets I make in another software called Houdini so I just make a simulation of it and make a texture of it and what is the spreadsheet is I can I can show you again I can do this boom this okay so what is the purpose of it so this is animation so it's like rendered animation so it will the sprite on the on the particle system so it will play through this animation from okay this part should we just go like this over just every frame of the animation yeah exactly so I had that but I just bumped up the color so you can't see the smoke in it and it yeah does this thing and then I added so the fire spawns another fire so it has even more but I am like that and then you just add some smoke to it so it's like yeah like this and together with sound and like the camera shake it's it's really cool it helps sell the effect even more right so yeah so that's it's it's kind of dynamic yeah like it's not the same every time no exactly so it has like different velocity and like it's but it has a chance to spawn in a different area in within like a sphere or something like that so it's it's different every time just click it yeah cool yeah so that's that's one effect I guess that this is what I think most people think of when I think about V fix like explosions and right stuff like that yeah yeah but there's there's one thing that I want to show you that the money people don't think about maybe so that's like ambient effects so in in dune desert for example I am making like the you can see like the heat haze yeah that yeah he tastes and there's like some sand dust flying around also with the player so when the player is moving around we have some dust flying in front of you but I I don't want it to be too intrusive or something I I want it to be there but not like necessarily right so it's like you feel it but yeah exactly so and this thing is like so hand I can place it out in there in the desert so if you get closer to these big ones they were just like fade-outs so you're nothing the way or something for you right right it's just like that and you said so like when you're the player and you're running around is it like just some stuff that's just around you that you see or yeah so some some stuff are placed in work to be like further away but this thing that I pressed on right now this is like following the character so we'll always be with a character right right and if we will update the wind direction it will like flow with the wind stuff like that and I actually the heat ace it's because I when I made the heat taste I didn't want like it could be pretty annoying if it's like in front of your face you can see like the resource note here don't have your face on it because if you had your factories you do everything just before yeah so I made a little debug color because I see you can see how it works if it's interesting maybe oh cool yeah so this is like it's a mask black tea right right now the gradient so the most you will have the most of the effects yeah these parts so something so the full effect is at the white places yeah and then it gradually decreases towards the black places exactly so I made it like depth and height as well so it's not like dancing in the sky very cool with it yeah super nice yes it's super nice to see these masks as well because like like I know of masks and things but I I've never really seen how it's made and I and I don't really know what it's look what it looks like when you work with it so it's pretty nice yeah I thought it could be fun to see yeah I think so I think and yeah and also there he tastes it works like during day in the material so it gets the strongest on like 12 o'clock or something you know when this hour cool yeah so it follows the Sun so during like closer to nighttime it will just fade away and stuff like that yeah yeah it's like small things like that that is fun to try out don't it yeah yeah it's nice small little details like I never noticed that I wonder how many people notice that I'm gonna do one of those things down and be like if you notice the heat haze changing different times of the day yeah the comments below yes but like genuinely I'm gonna check that because I I never noticed I'm sorry but I didn't it's okay it's okay there's things that I probably I probably felt it but didn't pay attention to it right yeah I mean that's that's that's a good thing because that's that it's meant to do it's not it's it's just supposed to be there it's just yeah yeah and also the the ambient effects it changes so if I go to the northern forest for example we have like these small dust things flying around you know sometimes there's like straws of grass flying so it changed changes dependent pens yeah you know that word depending yes where the player is in the world and this is stuff that I'm like updating sometimes I'm like I want to add more stuff to different biomes right right so yeah this is the exact same thing as what you should before where it follows the player right yeah so when you enter this area it will just oh we're gonna play this effect now and so yeah the effects artists do a lot of different things also like this is a cave-in in grass fields I think most people have been in it but like there's just some like dust falling from the roof like small rock sometimes bouncing on the ground and more like water yeah dripping water so this is what I'm working on like prototyping some stuff a moment as well to just bring up the atmosphere you know yeah is this stuff in or these prototype stuff this is prototype so it's not in but it's like some of this stuff will be in I guess at some point it's simply yeah yeah yeah so this is like dripping water maybe some seeping water and stuff like that but I I really like creating these kinds of small effects that just they are just there but people might not think of them but they yeah yeah and what else do I have oh yeah I saw this is like really simple effects I guess so this is just to grab the attention from the players just like Oh what what is this over here holy [ __ ] I better go over there all right so that's the summer salute yeah what what does it what does it do so it's gonna like just gonna but thank you yeah so something like that I think these kind of streaks or something you can see here yeah yeah this is a beautiful mesh okay okay coming it coming look at this Wow truly incredible yeah so this is a mesh that you can see in yeah like flying around like this so it's basically just a material that has like a like it's just panning over the UVs on this right right yeah so yeah I just made some [ __ ] random stuff and then I painted it with this so red you can see it's red and you will like change a little bit of color color on this stuff okay where it's no colors gets gonna fade out so so are you able to show the padding of the texture or no I mean you can you can see I can do it so maybe it's easier to see if you do this now you can see it following the streak so you'd like that yeah and it will spawn like it will spawn like you know the emitters that we saw earlier earlier yeah so he will spawn one of these and then we'll spawn another one maybe I stated and then like rotate them slowly and the the the texture padding thing is that just along each of the leg things yeah okay yes so I think I did yeah so you can see how like beautiful this is like the texture will move across here so it was ah okay so I just placed them like this so this one is shorter so you will finish quicker okay yeah I do [ __ ] for building as well Wow things buildings fact I didn't know we had built it - yeah apparently it's a big thing but then okay so this is smoke right so me and Ben we're talking about the smoke and like collide collisions and things like that whoops and so I prepared this up here look at this alright yes this is wait this is in the game or no yet yeah this is in the game I think it's in early access I'm sure but maybe not everyone has noticed this yeah so right now it's it's responding to the wind direction right yeah yeah it's if the wind direction changed it would change yeah and also like before many people know this like it will just go through foundations and stuff like you don't care about it but now so me and me and Ben tried some stuff on who is the technical artist so we so you can like if you build your foundations it would like it would react to their roof follow the foundation yeah it's like I am but this is like disabled on low because yeah in my opinion the manufacturer so you have like sparks supporters you know things like this you just die who suffer dust animation and I go in and add the effects like this to its spark he used the doll the VFX himself kidding yeah yeah you did and he's so he's so good and Christopher is our animator we've done a developer highlight on him maybe I'll remember to put it thing up here and he's crazy he did like all the animations in the game and all the VFX up until Simon started helping out or so I was taken over the VFX man but yeah yeah he's super talented he's super talented guy yeah yeah absolutely that's that thing and like it's like miners miners on the remaining so I just did some oh I might in course I want it to look like of course oh you've got the little troubles coming out cold oh dude nice so it's so it feels like you were mining the resources that you could yeah miner definitely yeah could you uh could you take one of the animations maybe the explosion or something and I don't know just like show what it's like to modify it and just make it short like stupid or I can't like can do that I'm just Oh does it work now yes we can change the color maybe on the yeah the flames okay okay can I do this [ __ ] [ __ ] okay where is it okay can you see this though yeah yeah so let's changed your colors so I have a color parameter here for the smoke for example see how the colors if I would change this to blue you see the blue smoke blue so you can you can like you can tweak all this stuff and you can like you can change so many things like size by life I usually have it like start smaller and like grow up and then it will fade away as well yeah so you have like this graph down here you can set the keyframes if you just make the graph like weird hey make it go bigger than smaller than bigger okay I can I can we can do it on the smoke I think it's easier to see because it's yeah okay do I have a size my life I have one right here let's bring it up to the graph and we can see it right here so now it was just a linear thing right it just grows yeah let's do it [ __ ] it's so small I can't see anything it is what's this false I it's perfect it's perfect I hope you would like me to see this or am I gonna get his post again yeah I think you're beautiful like this oh this is gonna be beautiful and I'm [ __ ] saving this give it this yeah put this in the patch notes you're getting into this Jase help Jase helped ya credit movie effects
