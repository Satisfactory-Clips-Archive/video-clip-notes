> uh what about water solar energy so this is something that we ask uh or we we ask you guys all the time are you guys gonna add solar waters to the game uh and we never get an answer no but uh this is a question we get a lot and we don't have any plans to add um solar any wind energy type situation i'm pretty sure we're not going to add water either um and i'll explain why i i said i'm not sure but so so like we know for sure that i think that water and wind is sorry solar and wind is not something we want to add mark went out to explain a little bit about this like a couple of months ago when it was on stream that it's essentially like in this game it wouldn't make sense because it's a pretty much an infinite like resource with uh fuel or power so you can essentially like slap down like a bajillion um like solar panels or whatever and you do like essentially have infinite power and there would be no like real trade-off with them and even i know that people are going to comment like no but you can clean them and like you can they can break and stuff like that like that then that kind of goes against like one of the big pillars game design pillars with the game that like we don't want you to like have to maintain your factories because it's that's not a fun aspect of the game like if you're on the other side of the planet and you suddenly need to like go to the other side and and maintain like a section of the planet they already built especially for no reason other than the fact that time passed yeah sometimes you have to maintain your factory because you're changing things or yeah you ran out of fuel but if if like your factory that you spend all this time working on just starts degrading yeah or or parts of it yeah it's not really something not something you're interested in um and the other thing was uh and the same goes like wind there's no like real interesting trade-offs with power there every power generator we have in the game there's some kind of like you know issue with it like nothing is perfect like there's always like you know issues with how you deal with it and uh like if we add wind or solar we don't find any interesting ways to create that like you just literally put it down and then you never even interact with it ever again and we've said before that like water is maybe potentially interesting because like you need to like put in like water uh falls and stuff like that and there's a limited amount of those but i don't think we're gonna commit to that because we haven't found like a good like it doesn't make you don't really know if it's super needed right because people will always ask for more like you've got the power of options that you have right and people always dream of like having more and then if we add that you'll just dream of having more again so so like so like satisfying that need to have more is not necessarily solving a problem it's just moving the goal post right so like we'll have to see there have to be some other good reasons to sort of justify why we would do that rather than other things yeah and moving the goalpost isn't really something that we do at copyright especially not with golf votes no uh especially not with voting on the qa side yeah
