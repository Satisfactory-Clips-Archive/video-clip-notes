### Transcript

> have you considered some sort of free demo for the game I don't think we have considered it I'm not sure if we could do it or I don't know if we I don't know if we want to or not I we haven't really considered it I don't know we haven't just talked about it- I think to some degree it would make sense because it's really hard to like you know in under two hours because like the main argument yeah like the argument is like you can use the refund policy but can you though like, this is a game that takes you know it takes more than two hours to really settle into maybe yeah exactly so like I don't know but we we haven't really thought much about it because we kind of you know when you make a video you're kind of making like another game in a sense because it really there's a lot of effort goes into making you make a demo you mean yeah oh sorry yeah exactly good video yeah yeah sorry no demo because like you have to design that just like you design a game like how do you best present the game and if the demo the demo isn't balanced well as a demo then people won't buy the game yeah so, and it takes time away from actual development so I think that's the main reasoning, why we haven't done it so far maybe once we hit 1.0 or something we'll do something like that because I think that's the case like factorio was also their demo didn't come out until they were closing in on 1.0 I think oh here's the hole oh oh I just need to go here you got this oh it's so- I just want to get through the fog plane oh my god it just never ends all right two hours would get you to two or five that's not that's not true I saw a speedrun of someone I'm sure it's true for some people yeah but that's not true I sure didn't get to tier five in under two hours I saw a speedrun of someone getting to tier seven in less than one hour but they cheated they used they used a glitch but it was it was a fun speed run though to watch
