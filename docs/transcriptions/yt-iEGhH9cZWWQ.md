### Transcript

> there you are there you go that's the that's the little teaser yeah all right so yeah that's, yeah as it was saying it's called the packager, packages things packages things yeah and there is literally no mark ii like yeah there really isn't a mark ii it's called mark one, and I think that was for effect in like on the buildable I don't think they I don't think the artists I don't know I don't know the reason why it's called mark one but there's I mean someone's getting fired it doesn't matter right and it's gonna be me and and why not, so so, so yeah that was the packager and I actually we're actually gonna talk a lot about it usually we haven't really done this before where when we see something we like reveal what it actually is but we're gonna try it out we're gonna try to and see it is so mark has sent me a [ __ ] ton of information about it, so we're gonna put some of the speculation to rest so to speak, so yeah it is a packager it it it replaces the feature the functionality from the refinery, that is the packaging part and the thing this the way this is gonna work is that the functionality of packaging in refineries is not going to be removed immediately it's still going to be available in your save files but you will not be able to do it on newly built refineries so, if you have set up like the packaging thing on your current build and with your refineries that will still work and they will all function and everything, but as soon as you start building a new one it's you won't be able to to do packaging stuff essentially, and it it is a smaller building it's I don't know how easy it is to tell from the video but it is a much smaller building it can fit on one foundation block and it's like roughly three walls high I think yeah it's less than three walls high but it perfectly fits on one single foundation so it's much smaller and it consumes less power it contains 10 megawatts of power instead of the 30 megawatts that a regular refinery, consumes, and one thing that mark also pointed out that I that I'm going to point out as well so the reason why the packaging wasn't packaged or wasn't in the regular update 3 is because we just didn't have time to finish it so we kind of took that functionality and baked it into the refinery and now that we have a little bit more time we want to separate it also because of community, by like popular demand from community that it is a bit of cumbersome to use refineries for packaging because it's an expensive building and it needs more power and it's big mostly that it's big I think it's annoying, so we're gonna separate those two and make it into a packager, the one thing the key thing here as well is that this is only for packaging and unpackaging so the the thing where like with the dilated diluted packaging fuel thing that will not be available in the packager because in that sense you're actually mixing fluids and that doesn't make sense to have in the packager so that's not something that's going to be available in the packager and I know that's something that's a feature that would add us to like one of the mods that's doing packaging but that's something that we didn't like, because it makes some of the recipes like it makes specific setups very overpowered, so we didn't feel comfortable adding that to the packager so that functionality is still part of the refinery system and yeah that's that's that's pretty much most of the info about that the input and outputs are also stacked that's not something that we've done a lot I think that's the first building we've done that with at least production building and that's something we're going to try out, we we feel like it's pretty we think it's going to be a good solution but we'll have to see after some feedback from people, but yeah that's that's the packager essentially cool and there's no more tube and there is no mark ii, and a lot of people keep asking about the, maintenance because there's that animation where it sort of just like explodes and goes everywhere, no there's no maintenance, yeah that's just we have that's animation we have, like easter egg animations in a lot of our buildings, I've had that for a while so it's just one of those and we were thinking of like should we include that in the in the teaser or not, because it is an easter egg like most of the buildings have some sort of animation easter egg yeah if you remember like our old nuclear power plant we used to have like this thing where like an arm would like pick up the fuel rods and stuff and it would like drop it yeah that was pretty good yeah there was a youtube channel that I saw that was deconstructing the, the trailer and they said the same thing they were like yeah it could be maintenance it could happen if it overflows or it's just another custom animation and we have a lot of those weird things and of course as bastion says here the unfortunate issue that we've run into is, yeah no maintenance as in no pipes so if we confirm something it's confirmed if we confirm it's not something that it's confirmed that it is so, yeah sure our maintenance coming soon what else we're referring to it as the coffee stain fallacy because like no matter what we say everything is confirmed obviously first even yeah exactly
