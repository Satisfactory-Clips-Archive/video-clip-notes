> um i would buy merch but there's no coffee cup actually that's something that we're supposed to do never talk about the coffee cup we'll maybe talk about the coffee cup next week a little bit maybe um but yeah so we're still sort of working on the coffee cup one issue that we're i guess we can just talk about the issue that we're having i'm just gonna do it if we get fired it's too bad follow your dreams so so like all right so the the problem with the coffee cup is we're trying to make it an enamel cup right guys because it's an enamel cup in the game but we can't get the the handle to be blue like it is in the game if it's enamel all right but if it's ceramic then they can do this if it's ceramic we can do it yeah so one thing we were thinking is asking you guys if we should we're gonna set it up more structured um is what if the cup was ceramic but looked exactly as it was in game versus if it was enamel and it looked not quite the same because the cup would have to be painted differently the handle would be painted differently yeah so exactly we'll probably have to structure that in a better way what we can put it out in front of people and lost your place and in total i've actually suggested that exact thing like what if we just changed in the game and nobody notices yeah yeah so we were thinking we could just change it in game so it looks like what the merch is gonna be yeah yeah but we're probably we're just gonna get a little bit of feel we probably put out like astral or something in the future yeah yeah yeah uh i can sort of see what people say do both needs to look exact material doesn't matter i think that's yeah like i kind of feel that way as well like does it really matter if it's ceramic it doesn't matter that much does it well someone's saying no ceramic in all caps so i guess it matters a lot to someone uh no one wants a ceramic cup okay um okay
