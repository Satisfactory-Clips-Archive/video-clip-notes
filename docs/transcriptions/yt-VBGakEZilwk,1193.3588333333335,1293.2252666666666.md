### Transcript

> move it listen doggo we've got a section on liz doggo, one thing that we noticed here actually is this little point here internally it is referred to as shrimpy or space rabbit and I mean that is kind of true because that is what we used to call it yeah but we didn't have a name for it exactly, and then yeah as this is the the wiki says here it was widely viewed as the game's mascot after its initial appearance in the teaser trailer, and that's that's true but the name liza dogger came from, community, it came from like basically from the comments there there was like a suggestion there and a lot of people really took the lizard doggo and then we started calling it liza doggo but we now call it lizado internally as well, so like I would say this is mostly correct but it's we used to call it that yeah everyone calls it liza doggo now oh oh they actually have that here the name liz dog was originally coined by youtube commented chad mojito nice this is wild that's a very chat wait is the actual comment does it go to that comment can you link comments I don't know if you can yeah you can't highlight it come here oh right here oh my god according to the trivia page here it says that it was killed by snoot so there's a real life lizard doggo featuring update for patchon's video we really use one of the animations from the gdc teaser trailer yes we've reused that animation so many times but it's also mentioned here that it was killed by snoot which is like I kind of want to say not it's not true it's like kind of open-ended what happens with the lizzie dog it definitely made death noises yes all right we can confirm it was in the subtitles the closed captions that have made death noises but did it really die you didn't see it dead I didn't yeah wait jase watch out it's coming right for us
