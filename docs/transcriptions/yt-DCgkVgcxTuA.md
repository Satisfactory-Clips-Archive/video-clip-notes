> is it even possible to fully randomize resource nodes on the map so there's a mod that randomizes quality but cannot change resource types is it technically possible within the game engine to make random placements, so- I think, technically speaking I'm not entirely sure, probably, well I'm not sure if I'm not sure if like randomly placing nodes in a different place is something that would work super well or if that works with that system but- I wonder if randomly, randomizing which nodes are where I think that would be something that would be fairly doable well I accidentally pinned a message my bad what's for dinner so watch for dinner yeah- I remember, when we were having the game modes discussion I remember there was actually something with the way we've made the nodes and made it not possible to randomize them and I that I guess also like if if there's not a mod for that that probably also that you know tells that tale that like there's probably more to it than that so but that doesn't say that it won't like that it's impossible to do it but we probably would need to change how the nodes are set up if we do that yeah, I think it would be super sick if we could play some if it's like a randomizer game mode where like the nodes are in the same place but they could just be anything right yeah and it might not like thematically make sense you might have like oil right next to some, I don't know like Criterium or something like that yeah, but like for replayability reasons it could be really fun I think but like in terms of randomly placing modes I don't know if that's like a super doable or not because then it's like there's a question of like well where's a reasonable place to put a note yeah but who knows maybe maybe you don't care maybe you just want it to be like that anyway and you get nodes in these weird places that make no sense we which could just be fun right if it's a game mode it's just replayability who knows like there's a pretty good argument for that so yeah I don't know I don't know what's technically possible I don't really remember how things work under the hood around nodes anymore so no but it it's a cool idea I like it, I'm huge into like the Hitman freelance more right now which is not really that but kinda because they do randomize a few things and it very like it really varies the game a bit so it'd be cool to just be like you know you start off and you're like oh I've got coal and nuclear next to each other or like uranium so like yeah yeah
