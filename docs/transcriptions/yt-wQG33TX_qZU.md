### Transcript

> is there any thoughts from the devs on making it easier for us to build circles I'm not too sure we've done like little things like being able to, micro adjust, foundations when you hold control and use the mouse wheel things like that kind of do facilitate that but obviously they don't make it completely easy maybe there's more we can do I'm not too sure what the team plans for with that though
