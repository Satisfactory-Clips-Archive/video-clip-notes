> I have two canons a desired game design, yes and no it wasn't intentional but, it's not something that we want to remove, for the most part we're pretty happy with it we think it's really fun, it's also not free right like you do actually have to like hook up and power many different hypertubes to make it happen so there's like there's a little bit of a price that you pay but it's also just kind of really fun and I think we're kind of kind of cool with it that's my understanding
