### Transcript

> any updates on the new tutorial, no no updates on no words on the tutorial last thing if we do that yeah it is like the most important part of the game is like the first, like your first time user experience so like that's the thing you really want to be sure that the game is like finished and ready so you know like but but I doubt we'd put much time into it right now when there's new things that we plan on adding so we might want to do that yeah lost when we've got everything else in so that we know that we can explain everything well I think the tutorial at the moment is pretty decent pretty good so I don't think we're in too much of a rush but of course we should absolutely absolutely revisit it to make sure we get it as good as it can possibly be it's super important for new players because it's definitely, I was gonna say how did I forget what I was going to say the moment when I started speaking because because I don't feel like we've seen ambulance, I think the thing we also kind of want to check out as well with the new because we added new analytics system or no not analytics but metric system in the game because we want to kind of figure out like where people drop off as well so like maybe we we need a little bit data on like knowing specifically like where people get stuck in the game if they get stuck so like if we start working on a tutorial system before we know have that data fully established then we might be focusing on like the wrong parts of the game where we think like oh this is something that people don't understand but it might be something else that people will get stuck on so we also kind of want to gather a little bit more data on that thank you I know that like, pipes and coal power was always a, you should drop off point in the past hmfs oh boy God I'm still well oh my God I still have flashbacks when I try to go to sleep you get stuck at that point then you're already screwed like you you've gone too far
