### Transcript

> any idea on the situation of a Paradise Island have we flip-flopped on that yet or it's like we have well the thing is we haven't really made a decision the only decision we've made is that we're not going to work on it at all so like okay so so if it's more work completely removing the island like if it's well okay it's obviously like a bigger topic than than that but so around the the the planet like there's a border around like what you see in the game and, we at some point we're going to go through the border and like fix that up and that's sort of its separate past like it's not part of the world updates per se or like the world biome changes per se, and if when we're doing that border pass we find that it's easier to just remove the entire Island then that's what we do if we feel that like oh it's it makes sense to not change it and maybe we'll change something around the Paradise Island or something like that then we maybe we'll stick around but the the thing that we made a conscious decision on is that we're not going to work more on that part of the the map, so that is you know what you know what I say I say we leave it in because we say we weren't work on it but who knows maybe we leave it in and then move the 1.0 someone goes in is like I'm gonna use create a time to dress up Paradise yeah you never know yeah never know maybe we just leave it in and then move the kill sphere closer so you can never step on it yeah so everyone loses but yeah that because like this is a weird thing it's like when we when the game goes 1.0 right we can get a lot of new players well probably who knows yeah maybe no one buys the game, and it's gonna look really weird to them whereas for the rest of us we understand the history right Paradise Island DLC oh my God don't you love it when the game has something and then removes it and then sells it back to you by the way Constructors cost one dollar each from now on it's like you have to use in-game currency to every time you buy something you spend on in-game currency yep hell yeah you can use little you can use power diamonds nice to speed up your production hell yeah now you're speaking my language what do you guys think you guys like it you guys don't like it why not it sounds you can buy you can buy Power diamonds and bundles you can buy 10 power diamonds you can buy 100 you can buy a thousand or the best value is if you buy 10 000 Bauer diamonds what a deal yeah that's like 25 off yeah it's only 10K dollars I don't see any issues with this honestly yeah wow Chad is moving what happened Chad is just moving like a lot more than it was let's go whale jeez I remember, I mean the whole like micro transaction things is a pretty touchy topic with most folks understandably don't get me wrong but, I do remember when we when we teased the, awesome shop that was amazing I didn't even think that people would be like would consider that we were adding microtransactions from that teaser like we did not intend to like make it look that way but a lot of people were like they're adding micro transactions it's a shop like oh Jesus but also for a while but the favorite thing for me too was that like oh [ __ ] but then we also didn't say no it's not for a while like we left the sort of, I think yeah I think we were stun locked by how kind of ridiculous that kind of was but I mean I guess it's not that ridiculous if some people have been burned by that in the past you know make sense that they were kind of primed to be against it yeah yeah no no Market transactions it's it's fine yet not helping oh yeah I know eight dollars a month actually oh speaking of eight dollars a month we might lose our, check mark tomorrow, yeah, that'll be fine and we only sold nine copies of the game I don't think we could afford yeah that's when the game becomes a loss I have to pay for the check mark on Twitter jeez yeah we were we were riding really fine margins says eight dollars to jail wait why people are why are people sending me money now team Jason why are you complaining give me some all right yeah give me the it's like, it's like a what's that yeah just give me the money I'll handle it for you like I'll make sure that coffee stand gets this don't worry just just leave Twitter don't give musk the money- I don't I don't, I me personally I haven't spoken to anyone about this okay but me personally I didn't give a [ __ ] if we have a tick or not so I don't care but yeah you'll know that it's us honestly well or or you won't who knows just it's the internet just look for the dumbest tweets and you know it's us you know like yeah look for my look at my art it's not like you're gonna expect higher quality tweets just because we have a checkbox or not yeah and like you know we have our handle is satisfactory AF who's to say someone doesn't take some other satisfactory thing put out take out whatever pay the eight dollars a month and get a check mark and now everyone's confused anyway so it's like, who cares man who cares who has the satisfactory like check mark I like that satisfactory handle I don't know I don't know if we ever I don't think we didn't take it because it was taken I think we didn't take it because we just did my stupid idea I think now someone has it yeah left-handed father of whatever I was yeah I was gonna be like probably shouldn't show it on stream because it might be yeah yeah yeah don't don't bother them by the way all right yeah yeah we're not changing out Twitter yeah yeah yeah weird guys that'd be [ __ ] stupid yeah yeah ignore it, anyway I'll come here it happens wait is it oh okay there's a difference between what we expect and what we get I kind of like that comment wait wait where was that there's a difference between what we expect and what we get it's like you said that, someone in chat Uber grunk grunk this it's true though you went and when it comes to us it's like oh there it is you can expect nothing and you get even less which is honestly impressive yeah
