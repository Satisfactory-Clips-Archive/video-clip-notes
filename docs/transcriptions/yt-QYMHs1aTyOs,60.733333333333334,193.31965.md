### Transcript

> are beacons so if you remember in the last video I put out, you can check the cart here you know what to do, I talked all about how we're aiming to do away with beacons, because we're replacing it with this new like market system that we made and I just want to clarify a few things when it comes to beacons like the equipment thing, because yeah like like I said we're aiming to do away with beacons and this is both in recipes and as an equipment piece so we plan to do away with all the usage of beacons within recipes, and changing those recipes essentially and this shouldn't affect you too much because most of the recipe changes are tied to like when you're constructing stuff in the workshop or when you're building buildings the only exception is one of the alt recipes for uranium fuel rods that uses beacons in like the production line we won't touch that yet but we will change that recipe in some time in the unspecified future but for update six that, alt recipe won't change but anything else that has like beacons within the recipe will either be gone from the recipe as in like skip that part or we'll kind of rebalance the recipe as a whole but like I said it shouldn't affect you guys too much in your production lines because the only like recipe that I use is that's automated is that all recipe so the beacons will still be unequippable in the game it will still you'll still be able to like run up to the the workbench and craft one if you want to but the main thing here is that once you place a beacon

> it's just going to disappear and and show up on the map essentially as the new marker so essentially what's gonna happen in update six is like all the beacons that exist in the world and any beacons that you may place on the map they're gonna be converted to this new system that we made with the markers with the caveat that you know once you remove a marker it's gone because you know you don't need to spend any resources to place markers and the same goes if you place a beacon that's then turned into a marker you know those resources are gonna be gone you know beacons will still sort of be in the game but they'll be converted into the new system and essentially disappear so hopefully this will clear up any confusion surrounding the beacons etc etc and with that being said let's dive into some
