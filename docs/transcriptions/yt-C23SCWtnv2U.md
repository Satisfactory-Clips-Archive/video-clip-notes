> will there be stories of the game yes there will be stories of the game in in 1.0 we're going to unveil the entire story i've i've talked about this many times but i'll i'll do a revamp here so the way the the way our story is going to be implemented is, we're not going to go down the route that like subnautica did with like introducing story segments one one by a time like one one by one and in early access we'd rather do the entire story so you can like play throughout the entire story in one go and you know enjoy that story is always going to be kind of like not maybe not optional but it's going to be something that you don't like you can play the game totally without playing the story essentially so you're not like missing anything by playing the game in early access right now story-wise so it's gonna make sense anyways to to implement it late and the story's gonna be really late it's gonna be the last thing we add to the game when we launch it 1.0, but you can still yeah it's not i don't think it's going to maybe we'll change our minds later down the line but currently it's not going to be like a mandatory thing that like takes up your focus to play throughout the game you're going to be able to play the game regardless
