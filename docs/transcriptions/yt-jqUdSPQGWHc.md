> i think these are like my favorite moments sort of in, between updates because like this is the the point where we're kind of like seeing the progress on the next update we're kind of we're still planning things out we don't exactly know what's coming, but like it's like super exciting to like oh this thing is finally gonna happen that we've been wanting to do for a long time like some some of the features that we've been working on for satisfactory like until they were implemented it felt like you know fantasy almost where like this is never gonna happen, and, that was the case for every four as well like i felt like drones are never gonna happen like it's impossible to make drones they're too it's not it can't happen or lights lights was also one of them lights we kind of knew that we were gonna do at some point but lights always felt like, this is this is such a big task there's no way there's no way, and then we did it so and the same thing goes for now for update five like we're super hyped for the things we're working on right now
