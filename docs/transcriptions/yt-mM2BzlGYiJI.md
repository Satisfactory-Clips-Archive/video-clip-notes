> and talk about updating the map we're making it more in-depth like making a few more distances i guess those are two different questions but like we're always working on the map the map is not done by any means, so yeah there's gonna be an update to the map again, as for like distances that's more like a optimization issue than if anything, a little bit of like you know the reason why we have fog also is like fog is you know a universal thing in game development where you try to hide, distance distance because it's hard to like do really good you know imposter sprites and like really good like optimized you just render distance, so fog is just good to hide like the ugliness that is you know this dude this build is insanely stupid one two three four it looks like you're spiraling the the i am oh nice
