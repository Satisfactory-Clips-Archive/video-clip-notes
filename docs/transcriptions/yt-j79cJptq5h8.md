### Transcript

> the with sync ever gonna happen yeah there's already one over here, this is where you sync all the fluids guys I think you've done this before I was catching up I didn't see until now so I was like what the are you talking about dude no wait oh don't dismantle the the toy yeah that was that was a close call you could have been disclosed and the biomass you'd have to reload the save file if you did that oh that would hurt yeah from from I don't know a while back but, so a fluid zinc I don't know if there is probably a this is probably a good question for me to ask mark, because- I bet there's a reason why we haven't added that, because as far as I know you can sync any fluid you just need the packager for it so while there isn't a like fluid fluid sink you can still sink most the fluids in the game apart from sulfuric acid and I don't know if there's a reasoning why you can't sink sulfuric acid maybe that's the thing that's stopping us from having a fluid sink or something or maybe it's just we haven't had time to make that because like one thing about the, the lore for the the sink is that it's like crushing it up and like sending data back somewhere and like crushing up fluids doesn't make any sense sounds like a really hard problem to solve yeah it is I mean honestly we'd at least have to spend a few days on it and, in this economy come on yeah they evaporate sulfuric sulfuric acid isn't a byproduct of anything though, I don't think so so no need to sink it right anyway
