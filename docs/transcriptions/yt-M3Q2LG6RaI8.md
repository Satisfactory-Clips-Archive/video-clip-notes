### Transcript

> every week you mean update five oh yes I also realized I probably soon will probably have to update the bot that we have on our channel, because update four is out there's still a few things that we're working on related to update 4 but for the most part most of the people working here at coffee stain studios have moved on to update 5 working on update 5 working on update 5 features, etc etc it's still way too early to announce anything or anything like that, I'm just going to like give you a sit rep on sort of what we're doing currently and, once we have an announcement to make about update five we're gonna do it but, it's it's still a bit too early so I'm really like grasping for straws here
