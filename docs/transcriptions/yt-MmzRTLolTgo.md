> so yeah we're gonna start state of Dev now all right Misty stream deck doesn't work yeah stream deck not steam deck I don't know why I said steam deck I guess like had something in my mind, how do I do this manually there we go cool one second that works right cool all right yeah so, instead of Dev we're going to talk about what's going on in the world of development for satisfactory right now so, if you're interested in that this is the segment for that so we launched update six last week right, and, super cool like I mentioned at the start of the stream, we almost broke another CCU record which is like the concurrent players, and that was kind of wild because you know update six was a minor update we didn't really anticipate that many people would come back to it and play it because it's like I said a smaller update, but yeah a lot of people did and played it and, super cool to see so thank you so much for that everyone joining in and, a couple of couple of like house cleaning stuff that I want to bring up if you are playing on update six and you're running into issues remember to go to our QA side questions.satisfactorygame.com, actually I'm gonna post the Reddit link Discord before I forget, yeah don't forget to use the QI site if you are running into issues please post it there, and give us as much information as possible please don't go to the QA site and write the game crashed because that tells us nothing you have to give us like some information like what were you doing what call stack are you like what does it say in the crash reporter if you are crashing it usually you can just press the little send button and we are we will get notified but sometimes there's like workarounds for some of the crashes

>, so yeah just give us more information we can't really do anything unless you tell us like what the crash is or you know how the crash happened, so so take note of that, please make sure to give us as much information as possible and posting on the QA site and if you have like save files and stuff like that, it also helps to reproduce some of these issues, crashes the game crashed I don't know we don't have that in the game our game doesn't crash it doesn't happen the crash reporter crashed then hmm who do you call then do we go to Epic in that case hmm I don't know, so yeah we're pretty happy with the stability of the game though like looking at the the crash reports that we have gotten, the vast majority of people that are having issues with the game are because of mods and there's nothing we can do about that, if you have installed mods for your four satisfactory then you're kind of on your own because mods are unofficial are not officially supported so we can't fix any modding related issues and we can't make it so that like the game can like handle it either so, please reach out to the mod makers, try and either like update the mods if you're running into issues or uninstall any mods and see if that still happens, the money Community are really helpful though so if you're aren't into issues please check them out and, reach out to them and see if what the state of things are I believe in the new mod manager version you can also see if mods are updated or not so if you have mods installed that are not updated, that is probably the prime reason why your game is crashing as well so just be aware of that, I just want to say that real quick but yeah we're pretty happy with the release of update 6. the last thing that's sort of on our, to-do list for update six really is the buildables that we have introduced in update six a real quick rhyme wine back or rewind is in the expert during the experimental, phase for update six we introduced a couple of new buildables we introduced the half foundations we introduced corner pieces for walls and we also have plans to add corner pieces for roofs and roof tiling so unfortunately there was a couple of snapping issues with these parts and they we kind of like introduced these parts kind of late and experimental and we would rather we didn't want to delay the release because we were kind of locked in at that point so we decided to sort of just pull those buildables out of the game for the Early Access release and then work on them a little bit more and then you know release them, separately as like a patch for update six and that's one thing we've been working on we've been working on a couple of Crash fixes as well and and ish fixes to other snapping issues that we've discovered, and there will probably be a patch sometime soon, maybe today, probably tomorrow we'll see but, it might not include the new buildables just yet, we will see I think we're sort of so I don't have like the latest latest information because we are actually looking into the build that we're gonna put out next we are actually discussing whether or not we can introduce the the new buildables that we said, but you know we're very close we're we've sort of already done the fixes we just need to test them out so if it's not in this next patch it might be that one after that unless there's more work than needed for them but, it's looking promising it's looking very promising to introduce the new, the new buildables so very soon very soon so that's that, and yeah we're fixing crashes that we're running into as well, and we're looking quite good on the crash board actually, it looks like a pretty stable version already but I know that some people are having issues, so we're working on that you look like Chris please you're gonna make me blush so and and and and yeah like that's sort of, we're sort of at the end of update six there so so that's that's it folks essentially First Data for update six and the the obvious question then is but what happens next so after update six, so we have decided and I we announced this last week we have decided that we are going to do an update seven, update seven is also going to be a small update it's going to be an even smaller update because right now update 7 is looking to be just like a wrap up update so it includes
>

>, some of the fix some of the stuff we didn't finish for update six with creatures are gonna go into update seven instead there's also a couple of other things that we've been working on that we haven't been able to finish with the game before that's also going to update seven and, yeah I don't know exactly what that entails though, because we're we actually today had the kickoff meeting where we sort of broke down the plan for like what we're gonna do for update seven and then the plan four going forward is so, but we will get let you guys know as soon as we can we will keep you guys posted there the next update might come sooner rather than later so it won't be like a I don't remember how long it was between update five and six but it probably won't be as long I say probably because you never know not tomorrow no so so just so you guys know there's this gonna be another update it's going to be a smaller one, we will see exactly what that entails and, I will probably post on our YouTube and stuff as we have things to show essentially, but they probably won't be like a you know how we have in between the updates before we've always had like this window of like where we're kind of quiet and we don't really say much and then we have this like window where we do say a lot of stuff about the next update and then we release it I think this down around the the window of like quiet will probably not exist this time around, because we might start talking about the update like pretty much from from the get-go, but I don't know we'll see it's it's looking very promising right now cool that state of Dev did I miss anything again it's going to be a minor update I don't know why I have this in bold on my notes here but- I said that so don't worry about it but just for emphasis small update iterative updates I mean this is sort of what we're aiming for when we're going towards 1.0 like we're probably not going to do like another big update until 1.0 1.0 will be the next big update to the game I think up until then you know we'll sort of take it as it goes so, if we need to know if we need to do another update after update 7 we'll see but right now we've just planned for update seven and then we'll see how much we can fit in that before moving on to the next step
