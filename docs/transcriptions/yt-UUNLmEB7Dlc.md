### Transcript

> official mod support before 1.0 would like to I think I think the the dream has always been to have official mod support before 1.0, but it's we're constantly like scope creeping so it's it's I think it's still like on our drawing board that we do want to have more official mod support but at what cost like it's not impossible that like we just feel like we won't be able to finish the rest of the game in any decent amount of time and then we want to do mod support and then we're going to do something else and this thing and this thing so it's definitely still something that I think we want to do but it's not certain I'd say or that's my feeling at least I haven't actually like confirmed this within anyone else but I think like the idea is to have one support for the game, official mod support for the game but we'll see what happens we'll see what happens
