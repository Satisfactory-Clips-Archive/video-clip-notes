> once blueprints it will be it will not be blueprints I can tell you that much like it's easier for me to say what it's not going to be because there are a few things that I know for sure it's not going to be I know for sure it's not going to be blueprints and well I realize that saying that as well that it might be because we here's here's the thing guys like I tend to be in meetings with our producer and our game director and they're like they lay out this like idea like okay this is this is our vision for you know the next coming months and this is what we're going to do and what we're going to focus on, and they say like this is specifically like what we think and I'm like okay so that means that this is not going to happen or this will not happen and then they'll like a few months pass and they'll like be like nah we're going to include this I'm like mother really we we've explicitly like for like half a year gone around and tell people no this is not gonna happen in update three or whatever and then it's in this in there so it's kind of so like one of these things where like we've been saying for forever that we're not gonna add more than what is it eight tiers seventeers night whatever eight tiers I believe was the original no more than eight years and then in when jace was making a video about that question he dm'd, our game director and he was like yeah maybe we'll add nine tears I'm like  you can't just change your mind like that dude, so that happens a lot so when I but but I believe that blueprints aren't gonna make it in update four I don't believe lights will make it either because lights is such a big system we would have to like optimize for, and right now like so so the thing with development right now which is why I said previously that we're carrying this weird song right now development zone because there are a lot of dependencies for stuff so for light specifically there's a dependency of something we need to do right now that we're working right now, that- I don't know like it will probably take some time and probably won't be done when update four comes out so like that's work for like update five maybe, but it's it's also impossible to tell because sometimes things take much longer to think of things sometimes it's like done before you know it, but yeah lights is is a much bigger system that I don't think will make it up to four, blueprints is also a fairly big system believe it or not, it's a bit of a big system overhaul kind of which we're gonna do I think at some point or not, because right now it's like it it's a deca car no sorry it's it's a house of cards that's the word is the idiom, where like you start adding one thing and break something completely different in the game, so yeah those two things I feel fairly confident saying so yeah blueprints in this context is if you played factorio or any other similar game where like you can select a bunch of a collection of machines and you can like copy and paste that easily or make it easier to build it, and there's two parts of it it's both the technical part it's kind of difficult for us to imp like it's it's tick it's it's like not a hard feature per se if you were like from start from scratch and make it right but the way our system is is set up, with connectivity, there's a lot of stuff that it affects so that's why it's kind of tricky for us to implement the other thing is that it's a big bit of a design aspect of the game that really changes like because you're the whole game is all about like making one thing at a time similar to minecraft, adding like multi-build functionality such as blueprints really changes the gameplay so in that aspect maybe like if we implement that it's more of like a oh maybe that's a really end game thing you know when you're like exhausted all the tiers and you're at the end of the game and now you're just building to reach the limit right maybe that's when you want that feature, and we're not at that point of development yet the game is is like we we haven't reached the end of the game yet, so that's why that type of development would probably not happen until way later, and I think also like we fall back a bit on like the current mods that exist like the, air reactions mod and like the macro management mod like those modifications right now for those people that really are at that point of the game where like they they want to like absolutely reach the end of their line right, so yeah that's that's that's the long answer to to that question
