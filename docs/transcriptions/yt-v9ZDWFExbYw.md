> yes the Titan forests yep, on that note actually I've seen a lot of people discuss Lots in general for the last update and it's it's interesting how that became like a huge topic or whatever please note that like all the laws well most of the lots for like the the big map stuff are like placeholder right now because we sort of realized when we were making the map that when we keep changing stuff we have to redo the laws and it's a lot of extra work, a lot of extra work you guys yeah so sorry, so we've decided to not like finish the laws until we feel finished with all the the tiles and all the all the stuff that's on the tiles so that's why the logs are a bit funky right now so just bear with us okay, what's a lot a lot is, sensor level of detail and they're basically just like, the level of detail of like certain assets so the closest you watch worth to it the higher the level of detail the further you are it'll be like a lower, level detail version yeah which is, just yeah so if you sub out like lower poly models when they're really far away you get the same visual like, quality with, less data optimization things yeah because like you don't need to render all the the vertices on a mesh if you only see like two P if the the thing is only two pixels on the screen right yeah so it's, so it's it's a optimization thing yes, and in some cases it can look funky if it's not working properly or if your laws are not properly made
