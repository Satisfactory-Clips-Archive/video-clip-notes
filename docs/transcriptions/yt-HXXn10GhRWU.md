### Transcript

> please consider adding a third person view that's also something that we have not been wanting to do like the it's been a very important thing for our game director previous game director that is in first person, because I don't remember the exact phrasing he used but it's like the first person view really makes it so that it's from your perspective and the third person kind of breaks that third person wasn't pre-alpha, the third person was not in pre-alpha the third person was like glitch people managed to glitch out the third person thing, that was not intended to be in the game whatsoever that's just that's just like the way the camera works and the the thing that it did that they broke out like the the truck that like car camera and toggled that on, which is still like there's still a mod for that
