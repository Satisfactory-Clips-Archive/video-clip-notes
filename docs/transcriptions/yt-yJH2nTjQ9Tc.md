> so a couple questions here how did you get into programming, that's a good question, when I was I'm away from the microsoft to, burp no, I started programming visual basic, when I was like 12 13., and I was I guess it was mostly because my dad was programming in visual basic and so I just kind of started learning on that oh and the ti calculators which is like yeah I would write simple little skit things on that and I really liked it and I always liked video games my whole life so I kind of just started trying to make video games and I started doing that in visual basic and then learned c, that wasn't really for games that was just to learn c and then I went to school for it yeah and just kept kept at it and in yeah in high school though this was annoying right before I saw somebody wrote c plus plus high school right before I was going to take the programming the one course they had they switched from c plus to java so what a slap in the face that was not a big downgrade in my book yes especially when you're yeah I wondered I took that course I took a course in java really I did I did it in high school oh yeah I took java in uni at university because we had to do every every type of programming so we did functional programming course we did a object oriented one we did a, we did c c yeah it's weird because- I remember c being really similar to c plus plus yeah and then when it it doesn't feel that way anymore yeah but I guess c plus plus has come a long way and c's kind of gone its own way I think ziploc has gone a long way but I don't think they're teaching any of the new stuff I that's the other thing when you see some of the new things you're like wait what that's okay that's never taught about like smart pointers and smart pointers is like the so I don't understand why they're not teaching that at least not at my where I went to yeah they tend to focus on more than the lower like the core side of it but yeah a lot of sorting algorithms
