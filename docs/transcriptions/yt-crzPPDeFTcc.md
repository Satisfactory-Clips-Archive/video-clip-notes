> and it it superseded all of them so like nobody was right or like it it over expects it's been amazing honestly, it's it's amazing thank you so much if you bought the game on whatever platform we love you no matter what platform you get it on there are no favorites here okay, but yeah the same release was amazing and, right now we're also climbing the like top 100, sorry the top like most best rated game on on the steam chart we're almost at one, the top 100 best rated game right now I think we're at like 116 so thank you so much everyone who raided the game, like it's I what is it like overly positive on steam it is it is insane, like for me, in my head we're still like a really small game development studio and like we made a really cool game, but like seeing it like oh it's in the top 100 best rated steam I'm like like it's it's insane honestly like it's amazing, 96 percent positive it's yeah it's it's it's insane, it's it's weird to hear it like hear people talk about it in like you know the same kind of realm as like the other like aaa games, because like as I said in my mind we're still small we're a small studio right we're not a big game dev studio, so so yeah thank you so much for for the support y'all and I know it's like a very tropey thing to say you know like all the content creators be like well thanks for the subscribers and blah blah blah but like there's no way to express how awesome this is and like how how thankful we are for everyone playing our game and like discussing it and like just you know being around like honestly it's it's insane like even the discord as well like seeing so many people be on it and talk about the game ,

> and like yeah the the the overall positivity that I, you know some people just see the negatives like oh some people just see like all the you know people that are burned out in the game or people that never liked you know the game from the get-go, but like that is just like what I see is such a small percentage and it's amazing to just receive all these kind words and whatnot, so thank you everyone for that ,
