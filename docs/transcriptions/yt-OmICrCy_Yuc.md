> do you guys have more plans to add more features with photo mode we we always have we have things that we want to do to improve it yes for sure, I don't know what is actually gonna like make it in for it we definitely have ideas on how to improve it and like make it fully fleshed out because the the photo mode that we have in the game oh, were sort of like late and like late additions to the the first release of the game I think, so we, we just threw we kind of threw photomode together as it is right now, for the release of the game and we always said like we want to revisit this and make something proper with it but we just haven't had the time to do it essentially so we hope we can get back to it and do more with that
