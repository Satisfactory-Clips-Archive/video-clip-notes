### Transcript

> I don't want to attack on Titan but I want to actually watch it I watched two seasons and then I was like I'm gonna wait until it's finished and then it was finished I'm like I don't have time to watch it oh was it good though it was pretty like the first season is super good but the biggest complaint I had was when they changed the title song like the first the title song for for Attack on Titan is like the best anime opening ever that's a that's a that's a broad statement right there but I just love that song yeah I just love that song and it's so upbeat and like that's the only anime where I didn't skip the intro for every single episode, because it's so dope, but then they changed the song in the second season of like this I, I always enjoyed the, what's the Tokyo Ghoul, I don't remember that song I don't remember the, unravel yeah right that's that's the super edgy one that like every everyone enjoys yeah pretty basic I've seen I've seen it but I don't remember the title actually you hear it you'll know it
