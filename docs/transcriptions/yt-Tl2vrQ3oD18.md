### Transcript

> else but you know we we've sort of talked about this a little bit in the past right where, something that we we're get we're gonna be looking into sort of like not revamping but like working on the build system so that people can, build the things that they want to build without relying on a lot of like these little hacks and stuff so some people might want to build in circles and it could be that in future updates that we will make changes to the build system that might make making, circular things easier but we'll see there's there's a couple of ways to achieve circular you can either like like the example here is the in-game, one thing I want to point out as well some people notice that like yeah can you kind of do this with like using, , wires and stuff to be able to achieve this but this video shows a way to not have to do that because this actually creates like perfectly circular yeah and the benefit as well with this as well because he demonstrates this with the wire right he's like you could be putting the wire down and everything but it's like is your wire going to be on the you have to then put it on the exact right location yeah you know, and this method here will make sure that it actually does line up with all of your other foundations so long as the your starting foundations are in the same grid as your other foundations, so check out that video I highly recommend yeah let's check it out it looks like there's a bit of, a bit of like a learning curve to get this technique down because you need to get your timing right but, he also shows a way to make that a little easier for you as well but yeah, it was really cool so and if you guys didn't know there's there's a couple of ways to achieve the circular foundations you can also do there's like a couple of in-game, tricks there's also I believe a mod for it, and you can also use the the some of the tools that are made like outside of the game like the skin the satisfactory interactive map and there's a few more I believe with the save editing so you can like just dump in a circular foundation grid on your map and just load it up in the game again so there's a few ways to do this but if you want to do this in-game that's what this video is all about vanilla so to speak or you can use the, the the brand did that work let's move on to q and a that was very insightful just I didn't know about that no worries yeah oh did it just meet me because I was hoping that it would make the beep sound oh it didn't I know it just muted you oh just muted me that sucks yeah still it's so good I appreciate that that [ __ ] thanks I tried I tried it's you got to risk it for a biscuit you know like if if that worked out right I would have been immortalized on twitch forever oh yeah you know yeah, so it was it was worth the try but then we would have gotten dmca for the beep

> who was that beep I don't know like people [ __ ] paid for noise and [ __ ] yeah white noise
