> any without spoiling the game's law are you thinking of implementing the story in an obvious way or in a way that there's clues of lore here and there so we don't we we don't want the story to drive the game but i think but i don't think it's get i don't think it will be unobvious i think it will be obvious when you when you know the lore is there or whatever um and it's it is a game that you can finish as well so like you will work towards something and the story will sort of develop over time but uh we don't want it to be a kind of thing where the story stops you from progressing uh or anything like that or at least that's my understanding of it the last time i've heard about it but i'm pretty sure that's the case because the game's about the game's really about building a factory right it's not a it's not a story driven game necessarily but um yeah yeah and before a thousand people ask the the the the stuff that you can't do anything with right now thinks the collectibles sam sam they're tied to the story yes so they're not going to be useful until 1.0 we're going to start at the game there will be yeah they will be there's uh there's a bit of lore in the game yep and the game will be uh you know you can actually finish the game so that's something that's going to come with 1.0 when the game launches um that's when you'll get access to the story and you know like the win conditions of the game and stuff as well yep i think that's good because like there are people like me like infinite builders when i don't have like an end goal i i can't really play them that well so like this studio game's not really for me like i like to start and finish games you know yeah so like for me there'll be like this like stopping point where the game's like you can stop now and it's okay you know that's true i like i like that i think i like it too because i like that too it always feels weird when you're like not finishing it like i tend to not want to move on to the next game until i finish the one i'm on which makes games feel like a project more so than like doing it for fun but yeah i like when i can feel that i actually like wrapped up something yeah because i i like to play different games so i like to like wrap them up and move on yeah
