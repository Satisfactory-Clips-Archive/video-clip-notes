> um all right so that's state of dev i can quickly also say about dedicated service because i saw a lot of people ask about it before and i didn't want to forget it and i legit almost did we are still working on dedicated servers obviously it's one of our uh like priority priority um feature sorry i just saw lolly in chat uh this is such a funny fit clip of when lolly did like a reaction to uh to the the lights reveal where lollies get like super hyped up and then you can hear her husband in the background like i mean like oh did they announce dedicated servers it's like no oh okay anyway um yeah dedicated we're still working on that and it's still like priority for us the good service has been such a big beast because you know the the seemingly it's not that difficult right well well it is because it's network right everything multiplayer is difficult in game development i don't think your people realize how tricky it is with development but but like most of the parts are there when it comes to to networking for the game and for dedicated servers but the problem we've had is that there are a few bugs and issues with the game that sort of are small issues but they require big reworks of the systems behind them and we felt that it didn't make any sense to release dedicated servers when you can end up in states where you cannot progress in the game as a client because when you're playing in a regular setting which is called a listen server where some the player one or like the host player is is the one hosting the session um then they can sort of you know they're playing like a single player session essentially so they can fix issues that might happen but if you're playing a dedicated server you might run into situations where nobody's is host so they can't resolve issues that maybe only a whole host could resolve at some point and so that's one major reason and the other major reason is that we you know the work that goes behind maintaining dedicated servers as well so you know we this is a huge game you guys like there's there's so much work that goes behind on behind the scenes um and the environment sort of the build environment that we have to set up in order for us to like work on this game is also a huge task by itself so like we have people dedicated on like not 100 but like majority of their time is spent on like maintaining you know the build server that we have for the game and like being able to distribute the game to the storefronts um and uh if we release dedicated servers we need to maintain that storefront as well sort of even though it's not really a storefront but it's you know that build needs to like be updated at the same time as all the other builds and it's it's it's tricky it's a lot of work that goes into that so like just being in a good state where we feel confident that we can keep rolling out updates to dedicated servers has been a huge task so that's also one of the main reasons but still working on that um hopefully soon trademark we don't have an estimate on the time yet we've like mostly because there's it's so much stuff that we don't know that we need to fix for us to the robot dedicated service so that's that's it but hopefully soon tm yeah daddy got it daddy got me soon to you
