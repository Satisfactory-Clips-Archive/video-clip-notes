> how big can you make your factory I guess we can touch on optimization here as well yes sir so your factories can technically or theoretically be as big as you want them to be so it all comes down to a beautiful computer you have promising no but we're working hard on like optimizing the game there are a lot of factors that comes into it like first of all it's an open-world game which it's in itself is pretty taxing because you can't load everything at the same time because the world is too big so we're streaming like tiles or what we call and dance like parts of the of the world depending on where you are and then when you build factors all over the place there's optimization to handle when you walk away from this so they don't render or run unnecessary CPU time and where was I going with this we're talking about socialization there's also net code like how much when you were playing multiplayer also how much net net cohere sending and how much packets you're sending etcetera etc what was the real question though that was Dale I mean it was it was how big of a factory can you make yeah and so I think maybe one thing to touch on there is the like the instant splines for example yeah so like everything is relative and in the game so you can make like you can probably do a lot of stuff but there's there's a ton of like it depends is the boring answer because like when we talk about conveyor belt specifically like when you look at conveyor belts it depends on like what's visible on it and you know how they're placed especially that we were optimizing it so that we reduced draw calls as much as possible on the spine or on the conveyor belt specifically so that you don't see when you see stuff in the world it's not too taxing and then also like when you start stepping away from stuff that it's not updated as often so there's there's a lot of stuff we can still do right now for optimizing it but we build pretty big factories ourselves right now so yeah it's it's like it's a relative question I guess it is kind of hard to answer we've done a lot of stuff with optimization I think we still have a lot of a lot of like ideas so I yeah else we can optimize so and I think it's kind of cool so yeah talk about the game if it's totally
