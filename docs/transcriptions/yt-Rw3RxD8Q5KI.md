### Transcript

> oh epic dedicated service so, we are still working on i know we kind of like the goal was to release dedicated service on epic last week, and dedicated an epic are soon trademark very soon, but i don't think we we know like 100 percent why it's not up and why it's not like when they're gonna be up but very very soon dedicated service will be available on epic yo is it some within the next week or so or is that yeah very close do you know yeah yeah yeah hopefully soon it'll be good when we get that out and and for those like we still don't really know what's i've been contact from some people who still can't see the dedicated servers on steam even if they own the game on steam so like guys i honestly like have no idea what to do at this point like because we've checked with valve and they assure us that things are set up correctly so in those cases just try to restart the the client again or something and and see if that helps but otherwise there are still other ways to get the servers so you can still use steam command and anyone can get the service via steam command there's more, information about that on the dedicated service page on the wiki, they'll be coming to epic i think we will still be putting, it up on docker as well and other people might already have images up on docker but i can't really vouch for those images yeah yes yes yes yes yes 45 minutes left of streams no let's just do this for the rest of the time yeah i mean that would be on brand
