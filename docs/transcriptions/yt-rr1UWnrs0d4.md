### Transcript

> in the game will satisfactory be updated to unreal engine five in the future and plans to have a community con contributor program where contributors can test up kind of things so we already have that kind of like because we do put up put out our experimental builds, early on and, I mean a lot of people play on our experimental builds because they come out so much earlier than our stable builds, so that is already in place, both on steam and on epic on steam you have to like switch branch and on epic there's a other like game that you can have in your library it's called experimental, so that's already in place as for if we will update the unreal engine 5, I believe we will because according to epic unreal engine 5 operating is is going to be similar to doing minor upgrades which which means that they're still working like they're which means that they haven't like completely rewritten unreal engine for unreal engine 5 which I don't think they ever will because unreal engine 4 is huge like it's a huge engine, and I think you want to iterate on that rather than like completely rework it so they say that it's simple and I think it's likely that we will upgrade to underlying five however that does not mean that the game will be running using, lumen and nanite which are the two new technologies that epic have developed because we don't know like what the limitations of those technologies are we also don't know what is required to be able to use them so it's it's like we don't know on that part it's it's- I think it's unlikely that we will use nanite at least but lumen apparently some people think that, lumen might be viable maybe we'll see depending on how that's implemented, or how what we need to do to implement it so it's it's possible, but we don't know yeah but I don't know like we will be updating on real engine we're we're kind of like you have like two type of developers when you're using real engine right some always update engine and there's some lock in on an engine version and we we want to keep updating the game because luckily for us on epic r developing when they're making like fortnite and stuff like that they are making stuff in the engine that they are implementing because of those games that actually benefit us a lot, so that's one of the nice things about like if you compare for instance unity with unreal engine or godot or whatever that epic are still making games like fortnite but fortnite is like the only one but on paper they're still developing like games and, even if they that was like the thing is like even if they didn't have the success of fortnite they would still have you know games that they're working on because it makes it practical and I and that's really nice, so yeah
