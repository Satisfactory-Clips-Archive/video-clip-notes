### Transcript

> there you are there you go so that was the e.t sequel was weird yeah so that's that's that's the one and and I've I've been so happy reading like all these threads about like how you know what what exactly is being showcased here so today we're gonna actually [ __ ] debunk all of it and disappoint so many people, because people read into this way too much in certain aspects it's it's great because it gives you gives us clues as to, what people want yeah it's really fun it's really fun to see all that stuff yeah and a lot of the time when we we we're a little vague or we hide little features in there it's specifically because we love seeing the like the conspiracy theories and the you know the the it's really really fun yes and and partly so I've intentionally built this like place base whatever intentionally kind of weird just because I wanted to see this type of discussion, so there are a few cases where like I've clipped power lines through the buildings and whatnot just to make it look like and it's not to be like mean or anything I just think it's funny to do that because people figured it out like people have like I've legit seen people that figure that [ __ ] out so that's impressive okay so the the main things that we're showcasing in this video are the jump pads and the new jumpers are awesome like the the old ones you had to like place them and then kind of jump and like try and like try it out and like die until you figured out we showcased that on our stream last week with jace [ __ ] working on the jump at his own base, yeah and it was so like frustrating because we were doing that I just sit in there like ah jays you know like this is so easy in the new they're the new gym so now we have like video evidence of like this is what like it's kind of like you know tv like infomercials where it's like before and after yeah so you kind of have that so you gotta you gotta grab that from the stream like play it black and white and then showcase that teaser after that, so it's way easier now you get to see like the the the jump segmentations, one caveat with that is that, so we don't have deterministic physics in the game so we can't like would 100 accuracy say like this is exactly what's going to happen in the simulation that's coming well smith has just written that the old ones doesn't even hit the same place 10 out of 10 times yeah like so this yeah these things are going to be more of like a guideline yeah but but they are way better like they are more predictive I don't know exactly what we've changed in that department but I've like jumped on them back and forth and they pretty much worked like almost every single time, there are a few cases where like you need to do a little bit of guiding when you're jumping on it but it's like it's way better, one thing that I'm kind of hoping that we'll be able to get in for the update that's not in the current build I believe is that like so it's like segmented segmented like so when you're scrolling it like jumps, I would like to have so that's it's also like stepless, so it gives you a little bit more freedom because sometimes when you're like different heights and it's like it's divided so if you're building on a foundation grid you're kind of locked in the grid, which made that demo or like that save file that I worked on a little bit tricky, because sometimes it wouldn't fit like the distance so I would have to like re rebuild it but hopefully we're gonna we're gonna fix that so that that won't be an issue, and one thing that I didn't showcase in this in the teaser is that you can angle them way more now like you can almost make a wall, and one thing that I also didn't showcase in the teaser is is you can also place them on [ __ ] ceilings and walls which I didn't know when I made the teaser and I wish I did because I would wanted to make it like walls sorry the jump pads you can place the jump pads on ceilings and walls and [ __ ] really yeah which I didn't think of trying, I hope that's true but that's what they that's what the developer told me who made it, so I wish I'd made like a like a room with just jump pads and just walk into and just [ __ ] fling around

> so that's something that community can can do, first one to do it gets it's a cookie or something, so that's pretty dope I'm looking forward to that I gotta try that out that on the ceiling will be so useful I remember maybe you couldn't place it on ceiling but for sure for sure for walls that's great that's really good yeah so that's pretty cool, and yeah like you can also angle them way more so like the the you can almost angle them like completely 90 degrees vertically so, it was kind of hard to showcase it but if you if you have like jumps where you land on the side of it you can just like straight bounce straight back out, so so there's like they're way more you can do way more with them essentially and I think people would use them more because I think like when when we introduced hyper tubes people like stopped using the jump pads but now I think it'll be much better yeah a pinball machine somebody needs to make like a pinball ping-pong room oh good now I can hit rock bottom even faster so I don't know if you can place, the jelly mats on walls as well but somebody wants to try that yeah something to try someone saying aerial faith play exactly same as portal basically and, yeah the jump pads and all the teasers that we've been putting out are for this coming update at like the end of the month yes, so it's not update 4. update 4 is next year beginning of next year so so jumping on the next feature that we also showcased in this teaser was the fact that when you're pulling, wires now from stuff and you aim at walls and ceilings it will automatically switch from the power poles to you know whatever mount that you need so if you're aiming at the wall it will automatically create a regular mark one wall mount and if you aim it at the ceiling like you show you can see in the trailer, it will mount it to the ceiling I'll play the trailer again at the end of this section for for those of you who are hearing this stuff but didn't notice it in the trailer and also there's some people who showed up who didn't see the trailer just you know they just showed up now so we'll talk more about all these features and then we'll play the trailer again so you can look for it yes can you have like it running while we're talking about it if you open like youtube so yeah so it automatically switches, one thing so we're not introducing powered walls which a lot of people really thought we were, and people were pointing out that like when I aimed at like certain of the the the power connectors it would show like one out of zero out of four connectors so we're like how do you getting how are you getting power the thing with like the double mounted wall thingamajigs is that they will only showcase one side so they were connected on the other side and they will feed electricity through which they do already, so that's why it looked like the walls were powered but they were in fact not and some people noticed that and some people, didn't I got it working by the way oh [ __ ] nice, but yeah it switches automatically so like there's way less less like switching in the build menu which is super nice, one thing also with the jump pads that some people noticed is that it doesn't automatically like immediately swing me and that's already in the game it's when you build it it will run the build effect and then once that's done then the jump at it becomes active so that's why it didn't like shoot me off immediately I saw a lot of people thought that like either you had like more control over that but no it's still automatic, and yeah like the [ __ ] move it's beautiful, another thing that people, noticed so by the way this moon is already in the game I know a lot of people saw like oh are you adding a new moon to the game it's like no it's already in the game this is this is just an et reference yeah there's an et reference that's all it is, it's not the actual moon because the actual moon is way smaller and it moves like above the skyline so what that actually is one of the like interest one of the developers were sure to point this out to me when we talked about it because he's like that's not a moon you dummy, but it's one of the planets there's like two or three planets that are like turning around or like rotating around massage, bb 2ab, so it's one of those and like during certain times of night it will turn like white what's the suspicious building in the distance a lot of people have been talking about this oh yeah yeah yeah you have an image of that somewhere I can let's say that let's say that I think yeah yeah yeah, I can I think I think I think I can find the image for you though I think I sent it to you so yeah so no no, wall mount, sorry no powered walls and, one other thing that people pointed out is that knight seems to be brighter which is also I guess a little bit unfortunate because it's probably because of the capture quality and we caught it because it we haven't really done anything with night we are gonna do something with the like night being too too dark and like I think it's also pretty one thing that's pretty good to notice is this as well a lot of people thought this was way better and that just gives to show that like the problem is like that there's still stuff we can do with knight to make it better like it and- I've noticed this a lot when I played gosu tsushima recently tsushima, where like night time is way better in that game so it really is like a I think it's more of a gamma thing or like and we also don't have that setting in the game which also makes it harder, so but that's unfortunately not in the fluid update, it just happened to look like it, what else yeah so let's talk about that, that secret building in the background right I just got it in time hey I'm giving you one so we I think we're good give me one second here oh geez that's not a that's not a what are you what are you showing me oh my god jase put on some pants oh my god wow jason I'm not pulling a tubing right
>
> [Laughter]
>
>, this is taking a little longer than expected oh yeah and one more thing that I noticed, that's also kind of unfortunate so the the power poles in the background there's like we're using I'm using the mark iii power poles there's apparently some kind of like graphical issue on that build I was running that like rendered some kind of weird box I don't know why that happened and I didn't even notice it when I was making it but yeah they wanted to point that out me they wanted me to point that out as well that that's kind of odd and that's not supposed to be there, a lot of people were like speculating about it but no one I really like had anything like what could this be used for it's just like a glitch unfortunately okay so, yeah all right here I'm gonna bring in the, secret building this is the suspicious building the secret building that people have been talking about yeah new building question mark in the distance what is that hmm all right let's just see if I can zoom in a little here yeah [ __ ] it how hard can you zoom in angry windows noises can you see it you guys can you see it what is that in the distance so that was not intentional for one thing yeah that was that wasn't intentional to be in that save I didn't even enhance more nice pixels yeah yeah I know the image is small so I can say one thing about that this is the same as a ufo sighting you guys like this is about the same quality here look yeah I can say one thing about that is that that's part of this week's teaser that whole like yeah, maybe not yeah I don't know how how far I'll go but that cis coffee state edition twilight theme that bigfoot is that the real bigfoot yep, so so yeah like that tube in the corner that's that building is part of next this week's teaser it's not done though the gray thing yeah the great thing all right so I'm putting the gray thing in the middle right now okay see that on the corner this is this is the top quality stream you all joined in for I mean I mean this feels like a conspiracy theory stream right now I mean it is I mean it is and we're fueling the fire let's do it look guys look so so that's the start of me starting to build this can you guys see this is this is what they don't want you to know right yeah and to the left back and to the left I'm gonna I'm gonna switch back to us now okay yeah do it wait that's not right hang on a second put on some pants dude
>
> [Music]
>
> oh don't tell me what to do there I think we're good yeah I think we're good so that was not yeah so that building was not intentional to be there like that was me starting to work on it and then I was like oh [ __ ] I have to do this first
>
> [Laughter]
>
> how big is it I don't even know what that thing was I it's no it's a yeah smith's working on the video someone else before when's the next teaser we put out videos every thursday so the teasers are, they're they're taking the thursday slot of the the regular schedule so it'll be out there on on thursday so in two days and it's going to be hype and we're going to have the teaser done early so we might get firmier on youtube to see how that works out first it might be done today, we'll see and we could give it to you soon but we're not gonna, what's gonna say it looked like a tractor was a really big tractor it's not a tractor I can tell you that much yeah so so so one thing also a lot of people were supposed to butcher sorry about this this week was also that power like everything is powered with, with, biomass generators I promise everything is powered by biomass generators but there are a few lines that aren't connected oh and I've I've I don't know if I can oh [ __ ] I don't know if I can maybe we can showcase it, after the next teaser goes out because I don't want to do it this week, but everything like it's it's a valid save but it's a bit funny because I've placed biomass generators inside every single building that you can and cannot see, and I've clipped all the power lines so one thing that people fail to notice in the video was that power also comes through the train station so what I've done is I've pulled power from that like glass box all the way through the map to like a train station that's way in the distance and then I have the train station come back to that train station and that's what's powering all those like, well snoop got really bored making this video yeah it was actually kind of out of necessity because I was like [ __ ] I don't like when I was jumping around I like didn't have power after I built it so I died a couple of times and I was like [ __ ] and I just pull power from the nearest like whatever I found so it's a bit messy, so what what what did we mess up what was that included so yeah okay so the sitting down thing yeah like that so that's apparently not coming in this fluid update that's that's me messing up because the way we created these builds was like I kind of like threw [ __ ] together in my own custom build to be able to showcase some of this stuff because it wasn't ready when I was making the video, but now it is and that happened to bring in some stuff that's like not at all part of this update but it's coming for update four and one of those things were that sitting down thing and it's not an emote unfortunately a lot of people were guessing that it's an emote, it's actually when you're afk so when you leave the session instead of just having the pioneers standing around looking like a doofus it will she will sit down and have a cup of, nutmeg coffee not make coffee but but but a lot of people are like you guys were really hyped for for being, an emote so I don't know like maybe I don't know I'm just saying maybe we should take that and do it yeah and, see what we can do about that but that's that's coming later down the line that's that's that's so you got a little sneak peek of something in update for right I guess this is something that might help with when when people see like, have that bug where they see a clone of themselves when they rejoin the game must be really jarring just seeing a character standing there yeah right but if it's sitting it might give you a bit more of an idea of like okay something is like I don't know rather a random model is here it's like oh yeah exactly it helps yeah it also helps like when people are literally afk and they're just standing around so you can differentiate between who's like not in the session and who's actually in the game but they're not playing right yeah right or like in the session and that will also that's also something for like dedicated servers because it makes it way more like, clear on who's actually playing and who's not with that and it's pretty cute and it's yeah and that's that's that's everything in the teaser that yeah debunked all of it and after the update is not coming like that's that's that's the noun or is it where is it I think we're actually going to be on time this time it's pretty good yeah yeah exactly now users will be able to tell themselves from like the phantom exactly exactly well I guess you could always tell yourself from them but now you've got some idea of what's going on and hopefully also for update four will have some kind of workaround or a fix for that issue with having when you're playing offline having like pioneers spawning ran up randomly and stuff like that
