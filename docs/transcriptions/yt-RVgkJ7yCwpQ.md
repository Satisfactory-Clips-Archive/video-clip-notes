> QA Size Matters to trucks hitting invisible walls since three years yeah so this is something that a lot of people have said before they're like actually QA site doesn't matter because this this thing has been reported three years ago it has this many votes and it hasn't been fixed that doesn't mean anything that doesn't mean anything at all, because the the thing is when it comes to prioritizing what bugs we do or what what we fix there's a whole host of reasons, so it's easy to pick these ones that falls through the cracks where, you're talking about right now trucks so this is an area of the game vehicles that we plan on reworking and so we're not going to go and fix every little bug with vehicles when we plan on redoing it all later right instead we can because then we're going to be doing work and then undoing that work and then redoing the work again later when instead we could put that work into something else right so this is how we sort of prioritize bugs and stuff like that with so many different things to take into consideration and so just because a bug has been there for years doesn't mean the QA site doesn't work there's like n any number of reasons why that bug has not been fixed yet but the other thing that if you take that argument the other thing that you're failing to recognize is the at like the the large amount of bugs that are reported and fixed almost immediately on the QA site this happens all the time too, so yeah it's just kind of because like there's like a weird thing with games it's like if if we were if we were to buckle down and fix literally every single bug in the game as it is now, one that would take a long time two who knows if it's even possible but you know we could try, three what level of bugs is acceptable right because some people will be like hey the game crashes for me every time but 99.9 of people it never crashes for them ever so like what's acceptable there and what isn't right, but then the other part of it is like if we were to put all that work in and we did theoretically somehow make it perfect the second we add a feature it all falls apart again because a lot of bug fixing, really does like when you're gonna like, like finalize things and get it all clean so it's not gonna break anymore you have to, like that relies on a lot of assumptions about your game and the underlying architecture of the game right you have to make a lot of assumptions and the problem is the more assumptions you make early the more problems you're gonna face later if you're going to change the game when those assumptions are no longer true right so if we fix everything now we're more likely to break the game later and well the game will break later when we add stuff and then we'll have to do it again anyway, but I think we're more likely to break it even more because we would we would have to make so many assumptions that aren't true now yeah so I don't know it's it's really rough yeah bugs are a Hydra yeah so that that's not and now here's the thing that's not to say that's not to say therefore the state of the game is acceptable maybe it is and maybe it isn't right and if you feel it isn't you can let us know right and we could have that conversation but it's obviously it's just not it's just not that simple that's all I want to communicate it's just not that simple and there's so many things to consider that maybe some of you guys aren't considering yeah I hope that was, easy to understand at least, can you at least give an official confirmation this bug will be fixed it's bad if there's so much QA votes yet no official statement I mean I don't know what you want me to say though kill Tech about this bug or any other bug like it right am I gonna make a doing to make a video that talks about every bug that's, three years old with a thousand upvotes and give an official statement, because the reality is I have we have talked about this countless times people who are always here on this stream will know that we've talked about Vehicles being reworked and fixed countless and countless times right and if and if I made a video and you didn't see it like well what happens then that it's effectively we didn't make I don't know we we could we could what we could do is, and this is something that I thought like would be really good is if we could be a little bit more diligent on the QA site where we update the status of things you know so then people at least they can see on the post oh this has been moved from like whatever to acknowledged or something like that right because then that communicates the state of the bug right but I don't know if it would necessarily help in this case because what if three years ago we acknowledged the bug but it hasn't gotten better right then it still might feel like it's not enough, and then and then the question is even if we were to do that who's going to do that right who does that do you want do you want the community managers to do that we have a lot of other things to do should we spend our time going through QA site and marking things as acknowledged or whatever should the programmers be doing that since they're the ones working on it but there's like so many duplicates on the QA site and should their time be spent going through the QA site to like change statuses maybe the producers should do it but they're also really busy so it's just hard that's all I'm saying like it's just really hard it's just hard it's just it's just a tough thing that so I really don't want to say it's fine the way it is if you feel it's not fine then that's that's valid but I just don't know what necessarily to do because everything comes at a cost so yeah I don't know I hope that at least clears clears up, the the situation a little bit, it doesn't fix the situation by any means but yeah I've been super impressed by css's response to bugs even when they can't be fixed immediately we're doing our best we're doing our best and something that like I've tried to instill since the very beginning of becoming a community manager is to, I think there's a lot of companies out there that feel that they have the expectation that they need to be perfect and I think that that's probably not a completely unfounded expectation there's probably good reasons that developers feel that way, but, I don't I don't really want to go with that expectation I think it's important to let you guys know that we're people that's why we do these streams where student I talk about Final Fantasy all right because we're just like we're just or just people like you doing our best and we we mess up a lot we do well sometimes too and, that's just how it goes that's what people do getting lectured by Jace about bugs and managing them great way to start a Tuesday I'm sorry if that was too much guys
