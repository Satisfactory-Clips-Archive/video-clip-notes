> what is the likelihood of lower, level recipes get a rebalance probably not too like I don't think there will be too many changes there I think the the biggest question marks we have are regarding like mid-tier and final tier, balancing so I think, I think that once I think there's a couple like that people think are very frustrating, I've heard a lot of people complain about aluminium, chains and stuff like that like those are the ones that we we focus on when it comes to rebalancing stuff like we we look at like okay what are the the recipes that people are complaining about, because like obviously it's supposed to be hard like it's suppose it's supposed to get harder as you play right, but there's a balance there because like the same was before when we rebounded the refineries, you know they were also kind of complex but they were complex in like just for the sake of complexity, so I don't know if we have too many things that we want to rebalance I know that a lot of people are gonna be like what about biofuel you but it is supposed to be frustrating yes you guys just want you guys just hear what you want to hear you all got dirty minds you all need jesus okay just saying remove biofuel okay so you can't progress in the game I love it it just gets stuck and like I don't have any power too bad suck it up
