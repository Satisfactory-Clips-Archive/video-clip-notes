### Transcript

> now in this update we've also added some
> quality of life improvements to the game
> so let's check them out by starting with
> jump pads so instead of having two
> different sets of jump pads it's now
> just one buildable where you configure
> the angle of the jump instead
> so previously jump pads would just apply
> a uniform force on the player when they
> stepped up on them
> but now jump pads will instead calculate
> the force needed to hit
> a specific target making them much more
> reliable in addition to this we also
> visualize the player trajectory so you
> have an easier time figuring out where
> they're going to blast you
> and for some reason now you can also
> place these on walls
> and at the bottom of foundations
