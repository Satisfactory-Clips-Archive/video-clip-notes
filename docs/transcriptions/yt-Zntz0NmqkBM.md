> you guys think steel cost is balanced that is right now i believe mark 3 and mark 4 belts are way too cheap cost efficient compared to mark 1 and 2. so the reasoning there if i recall because i i've asked this to mark once but i don't remember the exact answer but i think the reasoning is that like the way like the way progression is kind of balanced in terms of like you know what's difficult and what's what feels like it's kind of like tied into the same way as like you know level, like when you're loving up in rpgs where like you want it to be like a hill a bit but you also want to like reach tops and be like yeah i got this and now this thing is easy so like for instance when a lot of rpgs has it like curve where like, the higher level you are like at some point it's gonna like level out and you're like suddenly you feel powerful and then as you keep going it's gonna feel like a you know hill again and then you feel powerful again and it's kind of similar feeling with the mark at three and four belts where like you've you worked a lot with like getting up to mark two and then mark two is like a big chain of stuff but then if if mark three was gonna be you know just as much like just as cumbersome as making mark two belts then the game will feel like such a like a grind like it's way more than it is right now so i think it's a conscious decision that mark iii belts are easy to to build because working up to that point is the climb and then you get a little bit of reward making them easier and making them like faster to build and then as you keep going then mark four and five belts are hard to make so i think that's the reasoning why the the mercury belts are so cheap compared to, the mark ii belts, and i think that's gonna stick around but i don't know we always rebound stuff but i think we're pretty happy with that decision i started the game many times from scratch and i think the balance is very balanced, i think we're pretty happy up until tier five right now i don't think i i think we feel it's pretty solid up to tier five in terms of balancing but it's too hard what is that it's too hard the whole game's too hard can't fix too late again
