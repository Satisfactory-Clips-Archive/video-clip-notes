> what was the decision of making screenshots in documents folder and not and saves and app data so let me sit down kill children because here's the story it used to be that all everything was in documents, so save files would also be in documents but the problem was that for some windows users you are like windows block access to my documents for some software, if you have like a if you have windows 10 or 11 or whatever configured in a certain way and it's it's a lot easier to change the save directory then trying to communicate that like hey, you have configured windows in a way where we're not allowed to save in that folder, so like and app data is like the only folder that saw like programs on your computer are allowed to write to like no matter what like, access rights the user have on that machine, so we just made the decision to like move the save files to app data we didn't move the the screenshots because so they're separate and we haven't gotten any complaints about screenshots not showing up in that folder, so it hasn't really been like an emergent reason why we should have also have those in the app data I think they're easier to like if you're I don't know I'm kind of mixed on this actually honestly because like it makes sense that they're in my documents we we can definitely not do save files in my documents, but if I had to choose like it makes sense the screenshots are in my documents right, I hate game software I create stuff in my documents what would you want it to be created on your [ __ ] desktop like it has to be created somewhere, because because I don't think a lot of people re like an app data people don't know how to access it, so if it kind of like for us it doesn't make sense no matter what we do but I think out of the options we have I think it's better to have screenshots show up in my documents because if you're just like taking your screenshots and you're like I wonder where that screenshot showed up you're probably gonna look in my documents, granted we don't show them as like satisfactory they show up as factory game hope we can fix that at some point, yeah exactly app data you it doesn't even show up by default in windows you have to actually like get it through the exporter whereas my documents do then microsoft have a dedicated game folder at one point yes and that's where we're putting it it's my documents my games factory game screenshots my pictures I guess that makes sense too I love this factory game overhead with one drive and stuff but that's included in my pictures right isn't it but essentially windows be [ __ ] whack like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what we pick people will never like one way or another like it's going to be [ __ ] no matter what so we might as well just leave it where it is, we should have a counter how many times I scratch my nose on this stream why not add an option to specify we want screenshots okay but if you don't like but then you require some user decide what folder they end up in right so where should they end up if you don't get a response from the user of where to put it
