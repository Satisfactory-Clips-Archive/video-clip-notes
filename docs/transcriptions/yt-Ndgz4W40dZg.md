> i saw some questions about the merger and splitter thing, being able to have vertical splitters and mergers we're probably not going to add that pretty sure, and i saw another question about splitting ratios that's something that i think would be really cool to add to maybe the smart builder or something like that, i would love that feature make sure to upload that on qa site i'm going to drop you a site again i haven't done that well
