> I'm willing to take the chance since I will back up my saves I'll be willing to try it so I can roll it back yeah that's the place back up your saves a plus plus plus plus plus plus it shouldn't it shouldn't affect your saves but like there can be like the the issue can be, if you, if you load your game in experimental in the new engine update and your save is is crashing or your game is just crashing, but then now you saved your game that save won't really be compatible with the early access version anymore so you can't go back so definitely back up your saves just in case, so that, you can you can revert if you run into any issues and also if you if you do opt into experimental and you notice that the mods won't work anymore because that will be the case, then and you want to switch back then yeah you also make sure to back up your space I guess also important to note that you probably need to I don't remember how it works in the mod manager but you probably need to like set the mod manager to vanilla you shouldn't just like delete the mods from your hard drive, because if you do that then the game won't load in either version but, seek more information about that I guess on the website or the discord
