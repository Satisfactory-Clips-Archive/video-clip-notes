### Transcript

> in the patches video right so we've added doors to the game we've added, two types of doors we have the gates that we have here and we have the smaller doors that you have here and yeah when you approach them they will automatically open and, let's, let's never talk about that again so yeah, the doors work in in they have like three modes, they're automatic they can be automatic so when you approach them they open, like that you can also manually set them to like be always closed so they will always be closed and then you can always also set them to always be open and this mode is essentially you know the same way as before when you just had the open doorway walls that we had before what we've done too is that we've sort of taken we had like two buildables to be like left right door opening we've made them into one door opening now, and instead when you're placing them you're rotating the wall, one bit of an issue with that is that, if you place these doorways beforehand, you may have like a situation where some of the doors are like flipped and that might be because of some of the rotation data that we we might not have enough rotation data to know what what your intentions were when you placed that first wall, maybe we'll find a fix for this, before we launch for early access i'm not quite sure at this point, we will see we will see but this is a known issue to us at least so just so you guys know that but it might be worst case that you need to replace some of these wall ways where if it's not facing the right direction right one thing that you hopefully also didn't miss is that we've added a lot
