### Transcript

> is there some strange math problem with pipes feeding fuel generators yes, yes there is I don't know if it's a math problem but there there's a there's certainly an issue currently I think it might be but it's part of the but it's due to like something with the load load in I think it it is with that as well I think I think there's more to it because I know that like I would I would have issues with it when I tried to max out my pipes when I loaded in every time I would load in it would it would break but then also if I left it for a while for many hours it would eventually drift and break again
