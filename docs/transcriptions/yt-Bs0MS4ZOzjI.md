> is there some strange math problem with pipes feeding fuel generators yes, yes there is i don't know if it's a math problem but there there's a there's certainly an issue currently i think it might be but it's part of the but it's due to like something with the load load in i think it it is with that as well i think i think there's more to it because i know that like i would i would have issues with it when i tried to max out my pipes when i loaded in every time i would load in it would it would break but then also if i left it for a while for many hours it would eventually drift and break again
