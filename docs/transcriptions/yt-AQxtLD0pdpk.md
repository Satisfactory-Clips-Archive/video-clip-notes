### Transcript

> I've seen a couple of questions about like, if we can have crash sites fall as you're playing I believe there's a lot of reason why they're they're on their planet already I think this might be the singular most, suggested internal feature that I've been told really yeah in the sense that people come to me and say like wouldn't it be cool if we could do this yeah like every single time a new person joins studio it's the same god damn requesting all the time I mean I think it would be super cool, it's just one of those things like do we have time for that is it worth to spend time on that yeah making something else, I think it would be super cool polish though like it could does come with a bunch of issues I would love to have it in there but it's it's always playing the the time the timeline game with those kind of things hi natalie just not only stalking the stream yeah yeah what up I just saw this comment from ergo wouldn't it be cool if we just killed the bat no that came from nowhere sorry, that's so unprofessional snitch ah geez
