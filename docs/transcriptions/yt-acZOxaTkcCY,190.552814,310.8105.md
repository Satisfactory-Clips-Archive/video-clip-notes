> like when it's gonna be out on ea and the the answer to that question is we have no idea well we have some idea but it we actually don't know because up for a couple of reasons update six is first and foremost not feature complete so there's still a couple of things that we want to work on for update six and we don't know exactly how long that will take, you know we usually do a round where we do a bunch of patches and bug fixes to the game and then okay we're in that face period and then we move it over to early access but this time around we haven't finished everything with update 6. essentially there's still a bunch of stuff that we want to tweak and fix with update 6 and we won't be able to do that in a short amount of time this time around because age what I just said is a feature complete the other thing is that we have vacation period coming up in sweden so in sweden it's kind of common that around july august, like everybody goes on vacation, we have loss that essentially means that you're entitled to 25 days of annual leave in a complete like what's the word like in one in one go if you want to, but but but it's not because of like the law that we're saying like oh everyone has to go vacation like we want like we want people to go on vacation essentially like I think people at coffee stain are entitled to some vacation time and it just so happens that that vacation period is around july august we originally we've like postponed updates because of this if we can't release an update ahead of vacation period then we won't do it essentially but this time around we felt like we kind of want to get it out of the way because otherwise we'll just keep stalling and then the game will never be finished essentially so so this time around we just said okay whatever we'll release an experimental we're gonna patch it, and make it as stable as we possibly can before we go on vacation leave so like even on experimental maybe it'll be good enough but yeah just know if you want to play on a stable version of episode 6 it probably won't be until later, for a couple months before you can actually see it on the early access branch of the game unfortunately so what happens now
