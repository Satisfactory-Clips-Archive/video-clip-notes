> there's also something called the era
> actions mod and this is probably like
> one of the oldest mods
> uh that's been around this this is a
> [ __ ] legend okay
> and i've actually built like most of
> this building with the air reactions mod
> because
> so this building is just like every
> floor is like two constructors
> with well getting there two constructors
> um
> and i built like a [ __ ] ton of floors
> right and this
> building this takes forever um so there
> is a little way to like
> cheat it a bit uh using the air actions
> mod
> so the air actions mod is essentially
> like you mark down areas that you want
> to copy
> um and you can copy like foundations and
> constructors
> and like yeah move them up and stuff so
> let's just make a quick demo here so
> like if i have a bunch of foundations
> here and i place like
> if i play like an old well maybe not a
> whole
> extractor but like yeah i don't no
> let's just put a construction keyboard
> all right so so say that like i want to
> have this but i want to have like 50
> billion of them right
> um i don't want to [ __ ] like
> spend years building them right uh where
> are blueprints am i right
> um so with the air reactions mod
> you can let's see if i remember the
> commands you can click
> and look at the corners here and be like
> oops so now essentially like in 3d
> marked this whole thing
> and [ __ ] there we go
> and then you can like
> why can't i not see it copy paste yeah
> so
> there so here you can be like yeah i
> want to move it uh
> in the x-axis by 20 this is in-game i'm
> not quite sure what the
> the um the values are because i think
> it's
> our like internal one um
> because it's kind of easy to like have
> them line up they're saying to use
> fill fill oh yeah it's also pretty good
> uh the one i used is this one
> [Music]
> because this feel also i mean let me try
> it out a bit
> let me i'm gonna experiment a bit it's
> doing the y-axis
> so you can like using let me experiment
> so you're okay like yeah exactly
> so so here you go here you have like
> where you can quickly
> make like a bunch of them in one axis
> or if you have like a specific one you
> want to copy and paste and the thing
> here is like
> every axis was that yeah
> i make a bunch in every axis
> let's do it uh not that one
> [Music]
> okay and then you can be like let's play
> 10 and then 10.
> yes and preview that [ __ ] and the game
> crashed
> did it really yeah there we go
> it did it it did it yeah so yeah
> this just makes you know cool a little
> faster to build
> you know what i'm saying and the thing
> here as well is like i haven't placed
> these yet these are
> like previews so like if if it doesn't
> line up to what you think like i
> don't like like the clips here i don't
> like that you can be like all right then
> just uh
> close it oh wait yeah there you go so it
> doesn't happen so nothing happens
> so so let's say i just want to copy
> paste this
> and like move it 15. let's check it out
> sorry 16.
> can you like yeah it looks good and then
> you can be like
> okay boop and then i copied those five
> buildings and the cool thing is it also
> copies the recipe
> um i haven't set a recipe here but if i
> had i think it copied the recipe as well
> so this would have the same recipe but
> even then even if you didn't do that you
> can still go
> and see if i if i select all of these
> there's also a setting for like set
> recipe it can be like i want it to make
> iron rods
> pretty cool boop and you set all the set
> on rods for all of those
> so it just makes a building a little a
> lot more faster
> uh does this spend any materials asks
> cpu
> uh i think you can uh decide
