### Transcript

> um i'm just gonna echo real quick kind of what i said in the beginning of the stream when i talked about state of development uh before we get into q a so if you just join us welcome to our stream or whatever um we are we've just got out of releasing update 4 a few weeks ago and we have set our minds towards update 5. there are a few there's still a few like major issues for select few people one of the biggest issues we've seen is people having connectivity issues where they previously didn't we're looking into that we pushed a patch last week where we fixed some of the issues but not all of them and we're still looking into why people are running into this issue so that's that's one thing we're working on and we're also working on update five and and the things that are gonna come into it we're still kind of planning what's gonna come in update five so we still haven't fully decided yet we're going to do the same route we did rev before so we're going to have an open development talking about the features that are coming bringing you guys in uh share with you like what's going on behind the scenes so to speak for update five and tees you know drop a few teasers here and there about some uh features that we're working on um and i don't know exactly when we'll start doing that but it will happen sooner rather than later i think um once we know once we've decided rather because i know that some people like how can you not know what you're working on when i say i don't know i say like we haven't decided uh what we're doing yet we have some ideas but we haven't fully committed to all of them yet until we know whether or not we can commit to them essentially and it's it's it's it always feels bad to like announce stuff before we feel like we can commit to stuff so that's why we haven't said anything yet about ft5 but we are working on that stuff and the the one thing that i have touched upon is we're gonna address the cheat creed in update five that's something that we're that we're we've set our ice on so that you're going to be able to like build you know the same manner as you can with the cheat creed if you know what the g grid is it's like the name for the foundation type that doesn't have any collision in the game an update for a feature if you will um that we had to add after fixing the bug and make it a feature so that's something that we're looking into making building a little bit more enjoyable and give you guys more possibilities to be more creative cool
