> yes so the update 7 is is out it's not streaming let's touch this mic, the update is out on experimental at the moment experimental is our like test Branch so it's not available yet on like the regular version of the game but it is opt-in and anyone can try out experimental if you want to, and if you want to do that if you're on Steam you right click the game you go to properties you hit the betas tab that pops up and then you in that beta tab there's like a little drop down list and then you can pick experimental and that will reinstall the game and go into experimental mode and on Epic it should show up as its own game in like the games lists and you can install it like as its own separate install don't forget to back up your saves if you want to do this because it's really important because anything can happen it is an experimental release, we have tested it ourselves but you know Anything Can Happen, so yeah don't forget to backup your save files, one more thing I want to say, yeah and this is like an initial release of a lot of stuff so we're going to keep working on this I don't know exactly when it will be out on Early Access for everyone, it will probably be available sometime early December if everything goes well unless there's a lot of issues, I haven't seen too much chatter about it though so, I think we're good, that's, foreign so, yeah it depends on how it goes and what kind of issues you find and and, maybe we want to pick something up before or relax as we'll see but, usually it's like three four weeks or something like that of bug fixing, so so we'll see yeah six stars yeah usually reason Tuesdays so it's like yeah sometime early December essentially we'll see, it'll depends you can get the eyedropper to function, report that on the QA side please super good but we'll we'll take a take a look at that, crash around Auto saving oh no if you are crashing, you only the only thing you really need to know is you need to hit that like send report button that shows up, because we will get like a contact like, it will create a log for us and send it to us, and crash us we'll get that stuff for feedback and for like other bugs though it's best to go through the QA site and if you're getting a crash and, you don't get the the report button popping up then you also kind of need to go to the QI side and include your log which you can find in your local let's see it's in Local app data Factory game logs I believe, please add that there it's it's really beneficial if you guys when you're posting feedback and issues about that stuff if you're getting crashes and stuff like that it's really good to like include, logs or your save files and stuff like that and give us as detailed information as possible if you just go to the QI site and just write the game crashes that tells us nothing so really beneficial if you guys give us as much information you can and also like how to reproduce issues as well and, if you're not seeing the update in the launcher of your choice then make sure to restart the launcher completely, you know not just closing the launcher actually restarting it completely because if you just press the little x button in Windows or whatever it doesn't actually close it it just minimizes it for a lot of these launchers so, really important to actually restart the launcher and then it will most likely pop up again, yes it's my safe outside exactly I'll click on that real quick and, yeah don't forget the power wheel exactly don't forget to verify game files as well that's also important if you're running into issues because sometimes it's because of the install, this mostly happens on Steam it doesn't happen too much in Epic but sometimes, just re-verifying the the game fixes a lot of issues, so yes don't forget to uninstall voicemeetery sales yeah exactly actually didn't get any voice meter issues today that's pretty neat cool where's Chase Jace got hella fresh so yeah thanks everyone for tuning in I hope you had a good time I hope you'll have fun with the updates, and, I'll see you we'll see you next week again and we stream every week on Twitch, coffee stain Studios devs.com no twitch dot twitch.tv coffee stain Studios devs is where you'll find us we stream every week on Tuesday at this time so we usually start the stream roughly around this time and we should do community highlights we talk about the update all about updates to the game state of Dev essentially and we also usually do a quick round of like QA to to catch any questions you have if you want to get like the latest information the streams really are the best place to go, because they're the the easiest place for us to create content that is related to the game, so yeah thanks for tuning in everybody hope you had a good time I sure did and, hope you all take care until next time bye
