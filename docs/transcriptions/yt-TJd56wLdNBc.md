### Transcript

> a recipe balance changes coming before 1.0, may I mean if if there is any real oh well actually it could come with I don't know- I think we do want to do some kind of recent recipe balance change my thing because there are a few like holes right now where like this, for instance the whole beacons thing or like we don't want beacons in the game but there's like an old recipe that uses it and if we change that it might affect a lot of other recipes, I don't know where we stand on that right now if if we actually do want to make a recipe change or not or if what's coming, so yeah question mark for all of us we we don't even know what coffee stain what we want to do there
