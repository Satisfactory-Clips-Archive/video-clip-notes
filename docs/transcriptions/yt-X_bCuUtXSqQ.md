### Transcript

> did have we ever completed the last tier challenge, I have not I don't think jace has either what tier are you on like tier six I'm, tier seven eight yeah yeah I but I haven't done it like I'm still stuck like- I still need to do my aluminium which I haven't played the game ever like on my safe for quite a long time I remember doing aluminium but I don't I remember I didn't do drones that's as far as I've gotten but I also haven't played the game because like every time we do like every time I've done like any b-roll stuff I get so absolutely burned out on the game and I just never want to see it again so like the thought of returning to the game always feels like I need to like have a huge break and then I'll be like now I can finish it the other thing is like I'm not really good at starting over so like when I play I want to play for my save and that's fine I can completely play for my save but I've only ever played that save on stream whether it's here or elsewhere you know what I mean and so like some like people have like joined me on that adventure and I and I feel like I'm cheating on him oh yeah I play on that safe you know what I mean so and then but then I don't want to start a new one either because- I went so far in that season yeah yeah I feel like we also started from scratch so many times when we've done development stuff like when we're done play tests and turns I don't want to do that again yeah I don't want to do it again
