### Transcript

> did have we ever completed the last tier challenge, i have not i don't think jace has either what tier are you on like tier six i'm, tier seven eight yeah yeah i but i haven't done it like i'm still stuck like i i still need to do my aluminium which i haven't played the game ever like on my safe for quite a long time i remember doing aluminium but i don't i remember i didn't do drones that's as far as i've gotten but i also haven't played the game because like every time we do like every time i've done like any b-roll stuff i get so absolutely burned out on the game and i just never want to see it again so like the thought of returning to the game always feels like i need to like have a huge break and then i'll be like now i can finish it the other thing is like i'm not really good at starting over so like when i play i want to play for my save and that's fine i can completely play for my save but i've only ever played that save on stream whether it's here or elsewhere you know what i mean and so like some like people have like joined me on that adventure and i and i feel like i'm cheating on him oh yeah i play on that safe you know what i mean so and then but then i don't want to start a new one either because i i went so far in that season yeah yeah i feel like we also started from scratch so many times when we've done development stuff like when we're done play tests and turns i don't want to do that again yeah i don't want to do it again
