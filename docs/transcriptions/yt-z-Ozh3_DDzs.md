### Transcript

> how do you decide what belongs in the ma'am, shop versus in a tear i don't know because that would be a question for mark but yeah i guess it's just about, yeah i don't really know how he decides that i i like there are some things like i would have some ideas of how i would do it but i don't really know if that's how he actually does it so i actually have a little bit of insider information there so go for it mark has this dartboard with two sides and one side it says ma'am and one side it says tears and then like within that half there's also pizza slices of like or pie slices where pizza slices yeah pizza pizza in the sky pizza and pizza on the dartboard where which tier so dar mark just puts on a blindfold turns around hopefully hits the board and if it doesn't he just doesn't include it in the game and then if we ask him if we press him on it he'll just look to us sigh and then just say something profound and then walk away and and i won't understand in a moment what he said because it would be a little too profound and then a day later i'll realize it was just [ __ ] but but he somehow got got away with it again and it happens every time he's like, he's like doctor claw from mr gadget that's actually not true but mark's insanely well spoken and every time he says anything it's like really well thought through so i'm glad he's a director and not like me or or you yeah that's right you stood yeah glad it's not me and definitely not definitely real glad yeah yeah every time someone speaks to me just thank god it's not snoot yeah
