> let's see here how will save files be impacted come back I hate it when the chat like there's there's a thing where when you scroll in the chat you scroll a tiny bit and it's like you didn't really scroll the Gen it moves it again, I hate that, let's see here how will save files be affected by when update 6 comes to Early Access so if you're playing on experimental at the moment nothing will pretty much happen, you know your the version that's on experimental at the dates when Early Access gets the same update like we're essentially moving the the update out essentially so so pushing flipping the the version right so you're already on the version that you're playing on experimental essentially if you're on update on if you've been on Early Access though and you haven't switched to experimental and tried out the new things then oh boy you're about to to, run into some issues but not too like too big I think the biggest one is all the things that we've been sort of talking about leading up to update six is if you have anything inspired Coast if you have any buildings there, that's going to be like taken over by the environment like the whole environment's gonna it's gonna show up and and you know the spiracles and all its glory is going to swallow your base essentially, if you're using any of the oil notes in the Spire Coast the factories will still run I believe but, like the notes will move around and the miners will still think they're hooked up to the old old node so if you dismantle them at that area you won't be able to replace that Miner at that spot you have to go through the new position of that node essentially, so so that's one thing the other thing is that some of the recipes have changed, no wait yeah sorry it's some of the equipment recipes have changed there's like I think there's one or two old recipes that have utilized beacons specifically now we haven't changed anything with the beacon recipes for the plutonium pellets I think they're called the there's one like refinement process in the nuclear setup where you can use beacons for one of the old recipes that Ultra recipe hasn't changed yet that will change soon in the future, but beacons won't work anymore any beacons that you've placed on the map will get converted into the new like Beacon system that we have on the map in the map marker thingy which also means that if you have more beacons then we support in the map marker system those beacons will disappear and, I think those are the main ones like essentially if you talk to anyone who played update 5 and then move over to the experimental Branch like they can tell you pretty much what happened, in terms of their save files and stuff, so, yeah I think those are the biggest impacts and I'm just gonna repeat this again for people that may not have caught this but very important information here okay last week we pushed an update where we gave you access to like half a Nations and the corner pieces and stuff like that there are a couple of snapping issues with some of these build pieces that sort of make it so that certain materials they don't position correctly in the world they move around a bit and this is a bit unfortunate because we don't think we were going to be able to fix that like the main culprits with the issue which is like we actually need to change the the how the meshes are set up so they will move around a little bit in the save file and we're kind of mixed as to like what the course of action here is if this feature isn't really ready for Early Access, but we do like that people have access to that feature so like the routes we have is either to like not put it in the Early Access version and we'll put it in when we fix it in a couple of weeks or we allow it on both versions, or none of the versions and, you guys will lose access to the foundation those Foundation pieces that are broken and then when we fix them we reintroduce them, on experimental and then on Early Access essentially and option two is a little bit of a bummer because people who have had access to those Foundation pieces will sort of lose access to those Foundation pieces for a little bit and we don't know what the best course of action is because I don't I think like when people are not playing on the experimental version of the game they're sort of like you're you're opting into that and knowledge knowing that like the game is an experiment like the game is earned in Early Access correct but it's also in like an experimental State on Early Access, so things might get broken and when you're using things like bleeding edge stuff you know you lose access to that so and it feels shitty to sort of employ that school of thought when we put it on Early Access as well, so that's why we're sort of hesitant on including it in the like update six release on Early Access and we haven't we are prioritizing that thing so we are gonna be able to like decide soon but today I don't know what the answer is if we're going to include it or not so you guys will sort of have to find out what we do but just be aware if if those half Foundation pieces disappear in your game they're gonna come back don't worry I we're gonna try our best to sort of do a thing where save files will sort of like, migrate that issue over not the issue but like migrant over so like if you build half Foundation pieces they will come back and like repopulate or something like that I don't know specifics right now I just want to make you guys aware because this is like the only chance we have before next week to talk about this, so I just want to bring it up and then hopefully we can give you more information as the week goes life is tough as a tester it is make them invisible in the selector yeah that's that's one way to doing it but the thing is like yeah anything you've built before they're gonna move so so yeah maybe yeah I don't know I don't know what the best solution is will we get a coupon refund for those, probably not I think if you have unlocked them though they will get unlocked again if we do decide to remove them because they're still saved in the save file like what you've unlocked like I said we're gonna try to do migrate as much as we can so that like if we do decide to remove them then when when they pop back in like there's less of a thing you need to cater towards your own but it is what it is
