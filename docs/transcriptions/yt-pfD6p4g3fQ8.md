> just will this game come out on console at some point it's not impossible uh we don't have any plans for it right now but uh yeah we don't have any plans for it right now um which doesn't mean that it's not gonna happen i would be amazed seeing it on console um it will definitely not happen in like the current gym but maybe in the next gen or something but like it's both performance wise like running the game on current console or in next gen console but also like there are a lot of uh user experience stuff that would be ironic first of all having controller support which we have passively don't have right now we probably won't until like 1.0 because you keep changing stuff yeah it's rough when things just keep changing with control support yeah control input would be strange uh yeah i mean there have been versions of the game with like yeah back in the day and and i don't know i don't think it's necessarily strange so long as you can get the button mappings fine but uh a lot of people want to play with them and uh yeah i i don't know i think it's i think it's pretty legit i believe some people see my ass on the sofa and play because like i believe some people use the steam mapping thing i gotta change that now i gotta change that um i believe some people have used like the steam controller thing and i'm not quite sure how it works but like they've mapped keyboard bindings to steam controllers um and play the game through that and it kind of works ish but uh it's not optimal but we have like always thought about controller support whenever we worked on the ui i believe maybe less so now or more like deep deep dive into the madison keyboard situation um but yeah i think i think it would be cool play with an xbox controller it works oh interesting interesting because we we made like a push fairly recently or well recently like the last patch was like june or something but we made a push where like we've removed a bunch of controller support just so that people could better map it to the steam controller thing or something i've been told been told i don't know what actually unfold
