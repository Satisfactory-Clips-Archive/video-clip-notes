> hey everyone my name is jason i'm the community manager coffee stay in studios and today i don't have any cool like content or teasers or or anything like that no leaks but i do have information uh we have a release date for update four on experimental uh previously we had said maybe march 9th maybe march 16th uh can confirm now that march 16th is the date that we're going for we're really short 99 sure that we can hit march 16th you never know with gamedev something crazy might happen and maybe there'll be a delay but we're pretty certain that we're good for march 16. we still have questions now you know why does it go to experimental first and basically it's because we want the early access branch to be stable basically that's our stable branch and we do everything we can to make sure that the you know with testing internally to make sure that the game is as stable as possible when we bring it to experimental but we can never really be sure you know there's only like 30 40 of us or something like that and there's a bajillion of you guys and the feedback and the crash reports and all that kind of stuff that we get from you guys in the community um is just on a level that we couldn't get ourselves when testing internally so we put it we always put this stuff out all of our updates out on experimental first we gather as much information and feedback from you guys as possible fix any bugs all that kind of stuff stabilize the game and then once it's stable we bring it over to early access and that's just kind of the procedure that we have you might be wondering then so like okay so when's it gonna be on early access then don't know uh that completely depends on the feedback we get from you guys right but we kind of have a rough plan and our rough plan is we want to be on experimental for maybe about a month it'll take to stabilize it is our guess but this completely depends on like i said what information we get from you guys so take that date with a grain of salt you know it could be a month after that it could be two months after that if things really aren't going well um but we'll get it over to early access as soon as we can uh now you might be wondering okay well i'm on early access how do i get on get in on this experimental stuff you know i want i want to fly close to the sun i'm going to live life on the edge right i don't care if it's unstable i want update for the second it drops how do i get experimental i hear you say okay so everyone has access to experimental if you are on the epic version of the game in your epic library you actually will just have two versions of satisfactory there one's experimental one's early access download the experimental one and play if you're on steam and you want access to the experimental version you just find satisfactory in your steam library and you right click on it go to properties select betas there's a drop down box and then choose experimental from the drop down box and that's all it is the game will redownload the experimental version of the game one thing that you should be wary of is your save files whenever changing versions always back up your saves save files from early access to experimental are supported not necessarily the other way around and then also experimental is unstable so you never know what's gonna happen maybe you need to revert but then you can't and you've lost your save files now so back up your saves i'll leave the path to your save files in the description down below back them up before changing branches like that okay uh yeah so that's it you know when it's coming too experimental you kind of know when maybe it's coming to early access you now know how to get experimental if you didn't already and uh yeah update four come in march 16th we will also do a big stream so we stream every week at twitch.tv coffeestandstudiosdevs and we will do a special stream on march 16th for the release of update 4 if you want to hang out with us at that time so thank you all so much for watching this video i know it was just a lot of talking a lot of information but i hope you found it interesting and useful and i hope you have a lovely weekend this weekend take care everybody
