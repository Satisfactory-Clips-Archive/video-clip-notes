> steam has a built-in mod workshop system so just uh that could possibly work i mean that that system facilitates distribution of mods right but it doesn't facilitate mods actually working in your game and working with the rest of the game and the systems that you have in place so that's one area that we have to solve the distribution of mods is also another problem that we'd have to solve and that certainly works for steam users but we uh also sell them on epic and you know we may want to sell it on other places as well um and you know in the future and so we don't want uh we don't want it to be so that you have to have the game on steam to use mods um so we'd have to find a solution that you know maybe we could use a workshop but maybe a solution that we want to go with doesn't involve workshop or maybe it works involves workshop and something else don't know but that's a thing to solve in the future for sure
