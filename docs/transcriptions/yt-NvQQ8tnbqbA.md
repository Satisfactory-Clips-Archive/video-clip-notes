> oh it's so good this shot is so [ __ ] good bam i bet you didn't see so we were gonna use this shot as a reveal originally like this whole factory thing oh the other one's better yeah yeah and i and me and linus were talking back and forth about it and i was like i kind of want like something with more oomph with it and then so the the the, the inspiration for that shot is the kojima productions hallway ah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, so i was like lights like i was starting to think like what it has like a lot of lights that like reflect like what we have in the games yeah that's when that hallway shot came to persia that hallway shot was a [ __ ] that was the hardest shot to make because, we built it in i when i try to, this thing i believe yeah exactly exactly so we built it in like a sp and a place in the world on the map where like there was a lot of fog and when linus was trying to capture it for some weird reason there was like a bug in the editor where the the fog was just like [ __ ] it up and it will turn into daytime and we just couldn't figure out what the [ __ ] was going on so that was one problem the other problem was that the lights weren't done when we were making this, there was a bug where the the wall mounts or like the the floodlights things they wouldn't cast any shadows and lights in the in the when we shot this, salinas had to add lights to the scene to match what it was gonna look like in the end game, which was a real pain in the ass because you had he had to like manually do it in editor but then we found out we yeah and then we found out we couldn't use that shot because of the [ __ ] placement of the hallway so i had to rebuild it somewhere else on the map so we wouldn't get that weird cut what a nightmare and then when linus did that and was like all right i'll send you the next like here you go we can film it now and linus did that and then he got like when he's and he was sinking the the editor version he got like major like version control issues so he spent an entire day just struggling with getting the editor to work, just for that shot alone, so black massive shout outs to lena's guys yeah the unsung hero yeah and then linus had the idea of adding the the turnaround shot that's after this one, oh yeah that's a really good shot yeah it's a callback to the the cthulhu yep yeah exactly the update three, yeah yeah and then i added like the exposure change so like the exposure will it will overexpose over exposed and going down coming we're adding perfect and yeah some of the some of the one of the very few places where fade to whites are good you know like yeah yeah yeah not a very common thing but no, yeah let's watch it again it's really good and, i the other thing was like i remember you you sent me this part there's a big empty space of like nothing happening here like off just like, wait for it wait for it and you were like i don't know like if it's good i kind of like that we we hold on it for a while definitely the right decision to hold so you'll see here that there's like quite a bit of a weight here wait wait i got it but i think it was one second really good because i want a chat to like get a chance to like what's going on yeah imagine thinking about twitch chat editing a video yeah i mean that's true that's that's exactly why that ended up being that way yeah i think it's great i think it's perfect i get like goosebumps every time i see it yeah

> me and venus were [ __ ] freaking out when we got that shot yeah i've i've, i got, i've i've gone and watched like youtube with live chat so i could watch chat reaction twitch with a chat reaction i've gone and watched like other streamers and i'm like i just wanted to watch their reactions to like this part i've seen it like i've seen everyone react to this basically, it's really fun have you seen lola's reaction to this yeah i've seen lollies in bits in kibbits yeah the lollies one is the best because at the end lolly's like freaking out and you can hear her like [ __ ] husband like did they have dedicated servers [ __ ] dedicated servants man oh it's so i i couldn't breathe when i saw that oh it's so funny oh my god all right we're adding lights to the game yeah but these shots are all made by linus he he i gave him no direction he just apart from the hallway scene linus came up with all these shots yeah great this this, this part here the lights now your game can be brighter than my future so your game can be brighter than my future so i got that i got that i stole that line from, a korean streamer named changi who, she had like she was just particularly shiny that day i guess just with the lighting and stuff like that and she was like yeah my forehead is brighter than your future so like i just [ __ ] took that i'm like i'm saying this now it wasn't in the script or anything like no no i watched that stream like like hours before i started doing voice the the vo for this part yeah so funny
