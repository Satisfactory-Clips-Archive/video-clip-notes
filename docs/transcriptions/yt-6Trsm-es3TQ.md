> dedicated server doesn't show up in my steam apps enabled, because I'm located in asia I don't think it's a regional thing so here's the situation is- I actually don't I didn't get an update on it yesterday or today but I think the state of it right now is that the dedicated servers are only available on steam for people who own the game on steam but that is not how it should be and we've checked with valve and they've like checked on their end they're like nope it's set up correctly everyone should have it and then it's like clear that some people just don't so I don't really know what the deal is but we're going to keep chasing it up to try and fix that up but, we're also still going to be putting them out on epic, eventually that's the plan anyway and then also an image on on docker hub as well so we we will make sure that it is available to everyone also by the way if it's not in if it's not available in your steam library you can still get it via steam command it's just it just requires a little bit more know-how but if you check the wiki for the dedicated servers there's instructions there I believe, yep on, I'll put it in the chat right now there's instructions there on how to get it via steam command you don't even you don't need even need a steam account to get that, if I understand correctly so check the the wiki for sure the wiki is probably the thing that's going to be the most up-to-date at all times because it's mostly community driven and you know as things change then people are super fast at updating that yeah, so yes but also remember that you might need to like restart the steam client and like make sure to take in tools so it shows up and stuff like that, but if it's still not visible then, yeah we're just gonna have to follow up with valve and check in what's going on can you guys make a separate game slash tool that valve can put on this door store but that's kind of like what we we have done it's I don't know if it's like on the store but it's it goes into your library that is what we've done it is a separate game, it's just not appearing for some reason for people which is weird because valve have checked a bajillion times already and they say it's working so
