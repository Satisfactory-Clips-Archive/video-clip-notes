> work around for clients disconnecting on lawn saving processes no not really, because it's like an inherit problem you can extend the timeout time by going to the oh I wish I knew the name of that config file but there's a config file where there's like a client timeout and the default one is like 30 seconds or something like that so if the game saves for longer than 30 seconds then you can run into an issue where you get timed out you can increase that to whatever you want and that will be a workaround in those cases but when it comes to us actually solving that problem we're working on making so that saving will be faster anyone know that file let me see I let me actually look it up why the hell not I'm just I'm not gonna just dangle that out there without actually giving up because I think I'm pretty sure to talk to somebody about that file let's see if I can look it up while we're on stream
