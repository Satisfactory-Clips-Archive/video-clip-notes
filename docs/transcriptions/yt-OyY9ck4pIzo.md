> so yeah we were talking about a bit about planning but you know the thing about planning sometimes things just kind of just change real quick and we woke up this morning to just a bunch of like new things planned crazy suddenly right like, and we felt I'm thinking today you know it's a very special date as well yeah yeah I thought, it is the 22nd of the second 2022 and we figured that this is we don't really know if this is the case or not but we we get the feeling that the cosmos has like affected mark's brain or something something weird kind of happened we woke up mark had internal messages everywhere saying like these are the new things that we definitely have to do with these are great, and you know suddenly the planning just all the planning that we've been working on over the past couple weeks just, kind of went all up in the air and and and mark's on our rampage telling us that we need to be making these specific things so actually we thought you know to to make this day even more special we we kind of announced a couple of things that you know are gonna have that we're definitely gonna do for the game we were told we were told that we have to do it, student is putting this on quite lightly here but we were made to say to tell you guys announce these new features actually yeah update five is cancelled yeah so we're to brand new features out of debt they're definitely coming no but seriously these these are actually things that we actually kind of want to talk about we kind of talked about it too all right yeah let's let's dive straight into it jase let's get into it yeah let's let's do it okay so, you know the first thing, that marks had a bit of a change of heart on suddenly yeah what is it jase, I feel like we've set this up yeah I think we've see it it was it was it was silly and then you were like no but seriously these we're adding these, stop stop making it not silly all right look the cosmos has has given us its messages it has told us we need to add these features and who are we to not listen okay so the first feature that's definitely coming all right it's going to be base defense we have to add it right yeah right it's just too a lot of good the the stars have a lot of people really wanted it so you know yeah we are always open for feedback so, definitely gonna do it yep so, you we we we checked the stars on this on this fateful day and we're like we have to add it we have to add it okay so the next thing that we're we have nothing we saw in the stars that we need to we needed to add was factory maintenance definitely a lot of people also yeah yeah, you know, I think, mars was in retrograde and we thought you know what that means it means factory maintenance okay yeah because it makes it more interesting like the fact that you have to like make sure that your already placed factory buildings you know still work yep, anything else yeah well there's more like one really exciting thing for me at least is we're gonna add survival elements you know so there's gonna be like you're gonna need to cater food you're gonna make sure that you're drinking water as you're playing probably more than build factories actually we should add a lot of it, yeah insanely cool- I we I always enjoyed games like, don't starve you know we're taking a lot of inspiration from that kind of game you know so we're gonna add like all of that and more like there's gonna be even more survival elements like the like you're gonna have to make sure that you're wearing, , purely fitted clothing, because you can get like you know if issues if they're too tight or whatnot so like if you're wearing too tight clothes then yeah it's gonna be dope it's gonna be dope yep it's gonna be great, what else on this on this great fateful day, well it was observed that, you know from the ascension of venus, that it was obvious to us that the next thing we need to add is green energy because the, you know it's very hot on venus it is it is everybody knows so we should add green energy so green energy is is happening we're gonna add like you know, big big old wind turbines we're gonna have like, the solar panels that are so big that like they take up half the the screen, there's gonna be so many more things that I don't know right now at the top of my head because mark hasn't given us all the details just giving us sort of the, the general gist of it, yep yep so that's definitely happening and and I've already seen a couple of people really hype for this next thing jase that that we're also gonna add, super stoked that we're gonna add terraforming like I know we said for a long time that like we wanted to make a handcrafted world, and I mean it still kind of is but it also you know gonna have terraforming apparently, very juicy so you're gonna be able to build I hear some I hear some people here saying are you trolling is this a joke well you know this last feature this lost feature is gonna it's gonna make it clear all right because we wouldn't possibly joke about this because what's the last thing that we're adding to round the game ties into the last feature with terraforming because like the fact that we're adding terraforming also means that you're able to give ways to make your golf courses that's right we're adding golf to satisfactory it's finally happening exactly holy [ __ ] yeah there it is we're gonna remove the patchwork video where I lost, we're gonna make sure that I win or we're gonna make an edit, so we're gonna make like cgi chris evans is gonna jump in and save the day at the end to make sure that I win the golf competition so, yeah okay wow what a crazy day huh a lot happening on this fateful day 22nd of february 2020. wow wow on an incredible day two as well no oh yeah it is a tuesday that's right I saw that earlier on twitter insane yeah wow is it what a crazy day right guys that refund what do you mean refund this these are things a lot of people wanted I thought you guys would be stoked about this it's not about whether the people want it it's the stars that have told us to do it it's the cosmos that has given us the message to do this, yeah but, low aggro gamer I smell [ __ ] very good yes correct, we're just kidding here you guys those are the features that we said we wouldn't be adding in our previous youtube videos, yeah it's it's all it's all a sham all right the stars aren't gonna give us the direction for what we should do in the game snoot but you you said before I know it's it's so easy to say it's so easy to say right yeah I really thought that we were going to add all these things I'm sorry you know it's yeah but base defense golf actually [ __ ] dude somebody needs to make that game face to face they hit a golf ball at some turrets and they shoot it back holy [ __ ] what couldn't have seen that coming yeah I know it's just I know sorry we really had you guys there this entire stream the first 30 minutes has just been nothing but nothing but just just joking around yeah how do you can even trust the state of dev at this point how do you know we're actually working on the game yeah what if we're not do you I you pranks you know what I saw the other day when I was doing, like research on youtube whatever I checked some of our old videos and we had we had do you remember that at some point when we were doing the alpha key thing in the long ago when we were we had like a closed alpha running for satisfactory in the very beginning so every every week we would like send up a couple of keys and there was a lot of people that thought we were faking it do you remember that oh yeah yeah I remember that people were like there's not actually alpha running just making [ __ ] up so we made like a video of like community built stuff that we've not done and I thought it was so funny the fact that like we had to like no guys we're actually doing this game like what are you talking about yeah yeah like there were actually people in the alpha and people were like no the reason you're just lying and then we had people after we made a community like a video of like community creations people were then just like they're fake people that's great because why wouldn't they be yeah yeah I'm like okay- I just, I thought that was a funny like anecdote or like good memory something that like yeah big problem that we had in why back is the fact that like people didn't believe that we actually made worked on the game which is like actors absolutely yeah okay so cool thanks for coming to our stream everybody
