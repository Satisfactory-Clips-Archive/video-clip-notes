### Transcript

> ...and speaking of which, we recently released
the Modular Build version of our game. Now the Modular Build version is only really,
like, interesting- I guess- to the people making Mods for the game. Uh... for everyone else it just looks like
we made a huge patch with nothing in it, which is kinda true because the only thing that
changes is how we package the build. Uhm.. so we won't necessarily see, like, the
big improvements, like, this week, you know- in terms of how they would change the Mods-
but in the future hopefully the Mods will be better because of it.
