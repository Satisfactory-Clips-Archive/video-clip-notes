> uh when will fixmas end so i don't think we've decided a date yet uh for fixmas to end um fixmas will run kinda like um a little bit into january next year so uh i think last year it ended on january 18th or something like that i don't know if if it's going to be the same date but it's you know it's going to run a little bit so you have like a bit of time extra so like if you're not off during christmas for instance if you're off like after maybe in january a little bit you'll still have time to to try out the fixmes stuff so you don't need to like stress build and stuff like that for it's going to run a little bit into january too stress build now do it
