### Transcript

> zoop 50 slots like destroying no it's going to be too strong, but the other thing is like if it's 50 you don't really need 50. yeah you kind of can't it's it's hard to actually it would be hard to build that far meaningfully anyway it's kind of weird, yeah- I think tennis is fine it's hard maybe for you guys to imagine because you haven't tried it out but like 10 is it's not an issue like at all yeah it's like one more click you're used to clicking one foundation at a time you doing 10 foundations at a time is is like 10 times better and like it's it's not just it's it's more than 10 times better right because it's not just it's not just that you reduce the number of clicks it's like you don't have to aim and you know like and then like miss clicks and you've rebuilt you build stuff in the wrong spot yeah exactly yeah it's it's it's it's not it's a non-issue I'd say the fact that we chose 10. so it may that number may look low or whatever compared to like the deconstruct but it really isn't an issue
