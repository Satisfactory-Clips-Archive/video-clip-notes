### Transcript

> where'd he go will there be signs in update for no but but soon in the future we are going to have signs in the game at some point we just don't know exactly when, and there was a somebody tweeted about this actually about like why they think that we have we don't have signs already because there's a bajillion things that people are like why isn't this in the game already this is such an obvious thing and, it was a pretty good thread and the the tldr is that it's, when you're solving a on on the surface seemingly simple design issue, you're gonna end up running into a lot of other design issues that just makes the thing you're trying to solve much more complex, so and that's pretty much what happened with science and also that when we started implementing science like the bare minimum of science we also realized that but we can do this cool thing with it and we can do this cool thing with it and it just turned into like a feature bloated monster, for science and it's not I don't know I don't understand like science are gonna be like revolutionary and satisfactory anything like that but it just ended up being like such a bigger thing than we anticipated and then we said all right let's let's save that for for later because we were originally going to make just make a small sign thing but we realized that we want to make something bigger with it so let's save that for when we had time for that and then production happens that just like keeps piling on more and more things, so but sometime we're going to have signs and it's going to be amazing yep good good sense will be had by all scope creep never happened yeah it doesn't happen it's impossible
