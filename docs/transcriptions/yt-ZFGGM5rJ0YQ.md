### Transcript

> got it, all right so so let's let's address the maybe not the the elephant in the room but, the bauxite refinement that you brought up before so you kind of touched on this but what was the what was the issue with that and how's it going now I'm pretty happy with the box side at least like the initial rebalance I was already really happy with I didn't really have an issue either like the patch that we dropped wasn't to address the issue with the standard recipes we did do some small changes there like the the radio control unit went off being cost and because of that of course the the turbo motor also went up right and then we also increased the cost in bauxite for the heat sink which was mostly actually there to make the cost of the cooling system go up in bauxite and then also again make the turbo motor a bit more expensive, yeah I think that was kind of fun like- I'm really happy with the standard recipes right now I think the flow is good it matches the vision for the game overall and here the main issue that I was seeing was with the alternate recipes because they stack so much I think we generally made a mistake there by allowing that because the idea was that we would make bauxite a lot more, accessible in the sense that it's not as expensive anymore in the bauxite and that was mostly because we added so many new recipes that need to use the box site so we were kind of seeing this issue of okay if we make this not way cheaper then this is just gonna bottleneck everyone on the box side all the time so we need to change it so we added more box side notes and we just generally made it a lot cheaper overall but I think we went way too far with the ultimate recipes they just stacked it crazy where you could make a turbo motor using only five box side I think per turbo motor if you use the right alts that's just a bit insane that sounds great why didn't we keep that, okay so that sounds fine by the way you guys if you didn't know or if you haven't played the game the last week or so we actually did another balancing update last week on thursday where some of these old recipes were changed did we change anything with the the regular recipes in that balance update sorry what wait where am I, the the the update we did, thursday last week with the balancing did we change any of the the regular recipes there, yeah the standard ones right yeah yeah, we changed yeah the plutonium stuff and then for the box side we changed the radio control unit and the heatsink okay cool but the, yeah we can't we kind of like this this is the unfortunate side effect of being in early access when we're also figuring out some of these balancing changes, where when we were in experimental we felt like the the box eye changes were necessary and they were pretty good but like mark just said some of them were a bit opie, even by arsenal there were also some old recipes that I think used, what's it called the plutonium pellet or the the old no not plutonium yeah yeah they infused uranium yeah was it that yeah that was yeah that was just the up from my side so I tend to balance all of this in like a vacuum space especially the alts like the standard recipes they go into the into the editor pretty quickly so I can play around with them but for the alts that's just a show if I actually want to test that properly with every setup and every single combination so I'm not going to do that what I do instead is I just run the numbers in the, in the spreadsheet cool, and try to create like interesting tradeoffs there, yeah and then I implement them and then if I make a mistake I don't realize it until it ships it's like everything with game development it's like once did we ship that all right cool
