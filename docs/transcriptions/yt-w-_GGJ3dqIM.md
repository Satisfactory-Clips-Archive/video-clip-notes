### Transcript

> but the first thing we can point out in this video is that if you look in the can't see the mouse but on the train tracks there's a couple of pillars, when I was building this map somebody posted on a reddit like what happened to the the train track railings, or pillars or whatever from the the was it the reveal trailer or from yeah reveal trailer yeah yeah because that's some that was some part that we I don't know what happened with those I just like didn't want to do that actually I don't know they just sort of never no one spoke about him ever again I don't know and the only people who did they no longer work with us just they were fine because of that mysterious circumstances I don't really know where they went no one speaks of them anymore anyone who does disappears as well yeah so yeah so I built those, train railings pillars, because of that post so, good inspiration from that post oh so do we have train, pillars now snook no no not really they're they're, if the if the keen eye keeps a close eye you can you notice that we have a new type of pillar as well I'm gonna see if I can get my mouse to point out because this is annoying that I can't like show off stuff, capture curse is that working hell no all right whatever, you can you can if you if you look at the bottom of the the conveyor belt there you can see another pillar which is a new type of pillar which is a frame pillar yeah and exactly the keen eye, it might be hard for to distinguish from this shot but if you look closely you notice that hm the size isn't the same on those two types of pillars interesting it's very interesting force perspective you guys know as a master of force perspective hell yeah it just so happens that the the frame pillar is very close to this to the camera yeah smith's volume is a little this bill is so strange yeah
