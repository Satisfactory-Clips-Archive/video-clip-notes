### Transcript

> oh yeah what's up with jace by the way jason's been on vacation since april whatever, we kind of have in sweden we have a thing where like our vacation period is like two months where everybody in sweden just they're on vacation like everything's closed, we don't do like short vacation this weekend in fact in sweden we have like in the law that, that we are entitled to five weeks of paid vacation, and mo and one additional thing on that is that if people want to take out, like wait let me rephrase this there's also another part in that where if people want to take out four weeks they're allowed to do that un, interrupted during like july and august so like as an employer you are not allowed to tell people that they're not allowed to take vacation during july and august, that's just the way it is here and, like it's not an issue at coffee stores like that, it's just a fun fact, but, we tend to do the same thing at copper state like most people take their vacation during like that period july august sometimes maybe later for some people, and people take like long vacations that's just the way we do it because vacation is important y'all, you gotta charge your batteries and that's something that covers things think is important that's something that i think is important too and jayce took his vacation early so when most people are going to be on vacation jace is going to be working instead, and, yeah and jay took an extra long vacation because he's never done that before jace usually takes like a really short vacation he usually works around like, during the like christmas period and stuff like that, so that he's been like i guess saving up or something saving up time, because we the vacation days do carry over, to some degree i don't quite remember exactly how, so like if you didn't take out your full vacation like last year you can take it out the next year so to speak, so yeah so that's why jace hasn't been here for a long time but the the thing is, when jace ah maybe not really but like when jace comes back i'm gonna be gone so i'm gonna switch, yeah anyway
