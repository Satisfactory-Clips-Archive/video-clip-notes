### Transcript

> um oh yeah what's up with jace by the way jason's been on vacation since april whatever um we kind of have in sweden we have a thing where like our vacation period is like two months where everybody in sweden just they're on vacation like everything's closed um we don't do like short vacation this weekend in fact in sweden we have like in the law that uh that we are entitled to five weeks of paid vacation um and mo and one additional thing on that is that if people want to take out uh like wait let me rephrase this there's also another part in that where if people want to take out four weeks they're allowed to do that un uh interrupted during like july and august so like as an employer you are not allowed to tell people that they're not allowed to take vacation during july and august um that's just the way it is here and uh like it's not an issue at coffee stores like that um it's just a fun fact um but uh we tend to do the same thing at copper state like most people take their vacation during like that period july august sometimes maybe later for some people um and people take like long vacations that's just the way we do it because vacation is important y'all uh you gotta charge your batteries and that's something that covers things think is important that's something that i think is important too and jayce took his vacation early so when most people are going to be on vacation jace is going to be working instead um and uh yeah and jay took an extra long vacation because he's never done that before jace usually takes like a really short vacation he usually works around like um during the like christmas period and stuff like that um so that he's been like i guess saving up or something saving up time uh because we the vacation days do carry over uh to some degree i don't quite remember exactly how um so like if you didn't take out your full vacation like last year you can take it out the next year so to speak um so yeah so that's why jace hasn't been here for a long time but the the thing is uh when jace ah maybe not really but like when jace comes back i'm gonna be gone so i'm gonna switch um yeah anyway
