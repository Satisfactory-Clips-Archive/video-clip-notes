> will picking foliage cause slow downs be fixed do they close slow down low down college shouldn't cause slowdowns that's god i don't i don't think that slows the game down does it i don't know maybe maybe it does for some people but, please report that on the q website if you're running into that issue with as much, information and sort of like evidence details that we can draw from so we can help us understand what the problem is your hardware and your shoe size don't post where you live because i don't do that that would be that would be bad that's personal information don't put that on make the save file a lot larger oh yeah well that's that's always going to be the case, but i don't i don't know i don't know if but like the safe but you only get the stutter when you save like it doesn't yeah but also is that gonna meaningfully change the save file i mean we add like when yeah when you pick up foliage we add like, what foliage you picked up in the site file yeah but all that gets compressed so like it's not even a huge chunk like this that's what i'm kind of wondering about like like sure it does that it adds it might add more size but like is it meaningfully to the point that it actually is becomes noticeably an issue you know like if i if i ran around and picked up all the foliage yeah is my safe haul really gonna grow that much probably not but the thing that's gonna probably gonna take time is the serialization of when you're actively saving and, loading okay because then yeah you need to populate all the changes or yeah or you know gather all the changes and that can take some time and that's that's the biggest part of the save process is doing the serialization like the actual writing to the save file is like nothing it's like a small percentage of the actual save time so that does make like a that doesn't have an effect in the game but like it won't happen when you're picking up foliage all the time it's only when you're saving unless that was what they meant the save file takes longer or whatever that's probably what they meant yeah i assume
