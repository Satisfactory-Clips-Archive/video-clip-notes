### Transcript

> smart does too much that's that's sort of what we feel at least for a base game you know yeah because there's there's more to smart more than just like placing foundations smart mode also has like you know constructors placed up and you can auto align the belts to have them into the splitters and stuff like that so there's a lot of stuff that the smartphone does don't we feel, it's too much but but that aspect of like being able to zoop and place so so we could place up to 10, buildables at a time and you can do it in in in horizontal and vertical, you can zoom you can zoom anything yeah anything that can, be zooped can be horizontally and vertically yes
