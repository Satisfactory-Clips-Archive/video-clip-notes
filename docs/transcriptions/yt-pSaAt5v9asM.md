### Transcript

> yep um and uh one last thing on my little notes here is that uh we also talked in the past about something that we call the the modular build which is essentially the way the game is is cooked right now is the term when you're in the oven in the oven when you're building the game it takes like all the assets and all the like code and makes like one big package out of it and we're going to be rolling out something that's called a modular build where it doesn't like make one big package it makes like a bunch of packages and the reason why we want to start doing that is because it makes a little bit easier for the the the modding community to be able to like uh pick and load stuff uh through the game and uh it just makes it easy for them during development as well to like troubleshoot and stuff like that uh i don't know the all the the ins and outs of it uh because i don't haven't done any modding um a little bit easier is an understatement well okay awesome that it's actually that it makes a big difference uh the it will make one difference for everyone is that the the build itself will be a little bit bigger um i think two gigs bigger uh and there's like no new content it's just like just the way it's been packaged it's like way more compressed or something um so so that will maybe be noticeable the game will still run just as fine as before as please at least to our testing um but the modding community like it will be a huge advantage to them um and that is all coming sometime this week i think depending on some internal like scheduling thingamajigs but hopefully that's coming this week
