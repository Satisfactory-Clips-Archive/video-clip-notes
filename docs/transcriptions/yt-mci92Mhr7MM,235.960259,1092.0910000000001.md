> yeah I can what are you showing us first
> I've prepared some things okay I'm gonna
> show you an explosion from the noblest
> better run of thing yes everybody loves
> them
> me too so this is how it looks like this
> if I play it yeah so if you this is how
> it looks for me like when I'm working
> with it so I have all these things here
> is different emitters that spawn sprites
> particle sprites and you can like add
> textures to them or color and change all
> these parameters but I can we can I
> break it down or something so yeah sure
> sure sure if you can see this this is
> like if you can see the debrief eying
> around and then to this I add sparks
> suggests you add it in steps right so I
> have a Forex sparks of debris Sparks and
> debris so far and I can't really say
> this but this is a light so if it were
> closer to ground it would lift up the
> ground as well okay and then we have a
> dome so it gives this so cool thing
> around there you can't really like see
> it if you look at the effects like
> altogether but it's there and it makes
> it helps just make the whole thing come
> together and then I'm adding some fire
> this is some fire to it and this is like
> a fire see if I can show you this it
> looks like this it's a it's a sprite
> sheet right oh yeah yeah yeah so and and
> this and these
> sprite sheets I make in another software
> called Houdini so I just make a
> simulation of it and make a texture of
> it and what is the spreadsheet is I can
> I can show you again I can do this boom
> this okay so what is the purpose of it
> so this is animation so it's like
> rendered animation so it will the sprite
> on the on the particle system so it will
> play through this animation from okay
> this part should we just go like this
> over just every frame of the animation
> yeah exactly so I had that but I just
> bumped up the color so you can't see the
> smoke in it and it yeah does this thing
> and then I added so the fire spawns
> another fire
> so it has even more but I am like that
> and then you just add some smoke to it
> so it's like yeah like this and together
> with sound and like the camera shake
> it's it's really cool it helps sell the
> effect even more right so yeah so that's
> it's it's kind of dynamic yeah like it's
> not the same every time
> no exactly so it has like different
> velocity and like it's but it has a
> chance to spawn in a different area in
> within like a sphere or something like
> that so it's it's different every time
> just click it yeah cool
> yeah so that's that's one effect I guess
> that this is what I think most people
> think of when I think about V fix like
> explosions and right stuff like that
> yeah yeah but there's there's one thing
> that I want to show you that the money
> people don't think about maybe so that's
> like ambient effects so in in dune
> desert for example I am making like the
> you can see like the heat haze yeah that
> yeah he tastes and there's like some
> sand dust flying around also with the
> player so when the player is moving
> around we have some dust flying in front
> of you but I I don't want it to be too
> intrusive or something I I want it to be
> there but not like necessarily right so
> it's like you feel it but yeah exactly
> so and this thing is like so hand I can
> place it out in there in the desert so
> if you get closer to these big ones they
> were just like fade-outs so you're
> nothing the way or something for you
> right right it's just like that and you
> said so like when you're the player and
> you're running around is it like just
> some stuff that's just around you that
> you see or yeah so some some stuff are
> placed in work to be like further away
> but this thing that I pressed on right
> now this is like following the character
> so we'll always be with a character
> right right and if we will update the
> wind direction it will like flow with
> the wind stuff like that
> and I actually the heat ace it's because
> I when I made the heat taste I didn't
> want like it could be pretty annoying if
> it's like in front of your face you can
> see like the resource note here don't
> have your face on it because if you had
> your factories you do everything just
> before yeah so I made a little debug
> color because I see you can see how it
> works if it's interesting maybe oh cool
> yeah so this is like it's a mask black
> tea right right now the gradient so the
> most you will have the most of the
> effects yeah these parts so something so
> the full effect is at the white places
> yeah and then it gradually decreases
> towards the black places exactly so I
> made it like depth and height as well so
> it's not like dancing in the sky very
> cool with it yeah super nice yes it's
> super nice to see these masks as well
> because like like I know of masks and
> things but I I've never really seen how
> it's made
> and I and I don't really know what it's
> look what it looks like when you work
> with it so it's pretty nice yeah I
> thought it could be fun to see yeah I
> think so I think and yeah and also there
> he tastes it works like during day in
> the material so it gets the strongest on
> like 12 o'clock or something you know
> when this hour cool yeah so it follows
> the Sun so during like closer to
> nighttime it will just fade away and
> stuff like that
> yeah yeah it's like small things like
> that that is fun to try out don't it
> yeah yeah it's nice small little details
> like I never noticed that I wonder how
> many people notice that I'm gonna do one
> of those things down and be like if you
> notice the heat haze changing different
> times of the day yeah the comments below
> yes but like genuinely I'm gonna check
> that because I I never noticed I'm sorry
> but I didn't it's okay it's okay there's
> things that I probably I probably felt
> it but didn't pay attention to it right
> yeah I mean that's that's that's a good
> thing because that's that it's meant to
> do it's not it's it's just supposed to
> be there it's just yeah yeah and also
> the the ambient effects it changes so if
> I go to the northern forest for example
> we have like these small dust things
> flying around you know sometimes there's
> like straws of grass flying so it
> changed changes dependent
> pens yeah you know that word depending
> yes where the player is in the world and
> this is stuff that I'm like updating
> sometimes I'm like I want to add more
> stuff to different biomes right right so
> yeah this is the exact same thing as
> what you should before where it follows
> the player right yeah so when you enter
> this area it will just oh we're gonna
> play this effect now and so yeah the
> effects artists do a lot of different
> things also like this is a cave-in in
> grass fields I think most people have
> been in it but like there's just some
> like dust falling from the roof like
> small rock sometimes bouncing on the
> ground and more like water yeah dripping
> water so this is what I'm working on
> like prototyping some stuff a moment as
> well to just bring up the atmosphere you
> know yeah is this stuff in or these
> prototype stuff this is prototype so
> it's not in but it's like some of this
> stuff will be in I guess at some point
> it's simply yeah yeah yeah so this is
> like dripping water maybe some seeping
> water and stuff like that but I I really
> like creating these kinds of small
> effects that just they are just there
> but people might not think of them but
> they yeah yeah
> and what else do I have oh yeah I saw
> this is like really simple effects I
> guess so this is just to grab the
> attention from the players just like Oh
> what what is this over here
> holy [ __ ] I better go over there all
> right so that's the summer salute yeah
> what what does it what does it do
> so it's gonna like
> just gonna but thank you yeah so
> something like that I think these kind
> of streaks or something you can see here
> yeah yeah this is a beautiful mesh okay
> okay coming it coming look at this Wow
> truly incredible yeah so this is a mesh
> that you can see in yeah like flying
> around like this so it's basically just
> a material that has like a like it's
> just panning over the UVs on this right
> right yeah so yeah I just made some
> [ __ ] random stuff and then I painted
> it with this so red you can see it's red
> and you will like change a little bit of
> color color on this stuff okay where
> it's no colors gets gonna fade out so so
> are you able to show the padding of the
> texture or no I mean you can you can see
> I can do it so maybe it's easier to see
> if you do this now you can see it
> following the streak so you'd like that
> yeah and it will spawn like it will
> spawn like you know the emitters that we
> saw earlier earlier yeah so he will
> spawn one of these and then we'll spawn
> another one maybe I stated and then like
> rotate them slowly and the the the
> texture padding thing is that just along
> each of the leg things yeah okay yes so
> I think I did yeah so you can see how
> like beautiful this is like the texture
> will move across here so it was ah okay
> so I just placed them like this so this
> one is shorter so you will finish
> quicker okay yeah I do [ __ ] for building
> as well Wow things buildings fact I
> didn't know we had built it - yeah
> apparently it's a big thing but then
> okay so this is smoke right so me and
> Ben we're talking about the smoke and
> like collide collisions and things like
> that
> whoops and so I prepared this up here
> look at this alright yes this is wait
> this is in the game or no yet yeah this
> is in the game I think it's in early
> access I'm sure but maybe not everyone
> has noticed this yeah
> so right now it's it's responding to the
> wind direction right yeah yeah it's if
> the wind direction changed it would
> change yeah and also like before many
> people know this like it will just go
> through foundations and stuff like you
> don't care about it but now so me and me
> and Ben tried some stuff on who is the
> technical artist so we so you can like
> if you build your foundations it would
> like it would react to their roof follow
> the foundation yeah it's like I am but
> this is like disabled on low because
> yeah in my opinion the manufacturer so
> you have like sparks supporters you know
> things like this you just die who suffer
> dust animation and I go in and add the
> effects like this to its spark he used
> the doll the VFX himself kidding yeah
> yeah you did
> and he's so he's so good and Christopher
> is our animator we've done a developer
> highlight on him maybe I'll remember to
> put it thing up here and he's crazy he
> did like all the animations in the game
> and all the VFX up until Simon started
> helping out or so I was taken over the
> VFX man but yeah yeah he's super
> talented he's super talented guy yeah
> yeah absolutely that's that thing and
> like it's like miners miners on the
> remaining so I just did some oh I might
> in course I want it to look like of
> course oh you've got the little troubles
> coming out cold
> oh dude nice so it's so it feels like
> you were mining the resources that you
> could yeah miner definitely yeah could
> you uh could you take one of the
> animations maybe the explosion or
> something and I don't know just like
> show what it's like to modify it and
> just make it short like stupid or I
> can't like can do that I'm just
> Oh does it work now yes we can change
> the color maybe on the yeah the flames
> okay okay can I do this [ __ ] [ __ ] okay
> where is it okay can you see this though
> yeah yeah
> so let's changed your colors so I have a
> color parameter here for the smoke for
> example see how the colors if I would
> change this to blue you see the blue
> smoke blue so you can you can like you
> can tweak all this stuff and you can
> like you can change so many things like
> size by life I usually have it like
> start smaller and like grow up and then
> it will fade away as well
> yeah so you have like this graph down
> here you can set the keyframes if you
> just make the graph like weird hey make
> it go bigger than smaller than bigger
> okay I can I can we can do it on the
> smoke I think it's easier to see because
> it's yeah okay do I have a size my life
> I have one right here
> let's bring it up to the graph and we
> can see it right here so now it was just
> a linear thing right it just grows yeah
> let's do it
> [ __ ] it's so small I can't see anything
> it is what's this false I
> it's perfect it's perfect I hope you
> would like me to see this or am I gonna
> get his post again yeah I think you're
> beautiful like this oh this is gonna be
> beautiful and I'm [ __ ] saving this
> give it this yeah put this in the patch
