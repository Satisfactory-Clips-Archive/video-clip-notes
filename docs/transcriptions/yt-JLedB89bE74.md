> my game 100 of time lags at the same spots on the map fix this please wherever the uh it's a next loading section i think we have some plans for how we're going to be loading the maps in the future which should hopefully give better performance um i think we've talked about taking the tiles and essentially just cutting them up to be even smaller uh so that whenever you get to loading spots the tile will be smaller so it doesn't have to load as much if i remember correctly i think i think i was in a video with ben i think so you know i don't think that's in the game right now and hopefully that will help
