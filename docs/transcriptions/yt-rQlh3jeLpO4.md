> engine update will make the game run better i mean sort of yes we were kind of we're kind of hoping that the next engine update will have better directx support um because that's directx if we could update the game to directx 12 that would also make a huge improvement uh in terms of draw calls and that's a huge portion of time that's that can be improved on so that's also something we're hoping on to be able to support directx 12 in the future
