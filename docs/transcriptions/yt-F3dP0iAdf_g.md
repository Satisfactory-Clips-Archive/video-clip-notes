### Transcript

> should we wrap it up it's getting, what we should yes we should but there's wait there's one thing that I where is it where is it where is it where is it where is it where is it okay someone asked oh did I find it someone asked can we get green tech oh I just found it just as I clicked away here we need Green Tech, make solar panels yeah maybe you do right now the reason I'm bringing this up is because we're not gonna add it, but here's here's a video where I talk about not only how we're not going to be adding oh I like this but there's five other things that we're not gonna add I made a whole video about it all right and here's the thing guys I've had a goal there's two goals of mine yeah since becoming a community manager and like doing content creation there were just crazy goals that I thought would never ever ever happen but they were just goals that I had one was to get to 10 000 followers on Twitter and I'm very close to that and then the other one is get a video to 1 million views that I made and that video guys for some reason that I don't understand it's not even my best video I'm not even close, is that 928 000 views guys so if you could I don't know watch that make sure you like make sure you comment try keep getting YouTube to pump it a little bit I'm so close to meeting my my goal you guys, I actually maybe I don't know- I don't know why I don't care about views that much but this is just a thing that I wanted to achieve so, please please help Jace achieve this so he can feel empty afterwards this would be like oh we achieve my goal you will get nothing for it I guess no but you know what neither will I yeah we get to a million and nothing will change I know what I mean like you're gonna get to million be like oh I achieved my goal, now what yeah exactly I mean I mean like how is a million any any more, impressive than 928 000 that's that's already insane right so I'm already like really grateful that it's doing well at all, it's just like an arbitrary number that I had picked a long time ago and it would just be cool to see but I don't it's it's obviously not really that important regardless of that stuff like regardless how many views the video has I think it's one of the more interesting videos we've ever made because it it's kind a bold to be like this is not this is what we're not doing with the game because we are very open about a lot of things like stuff that you know we felt a long time ago we're not gonna do this We're Not Gonna add pipes is this not gonna happen turns out we added pipes but there's there's a few things that we feel like this is not satisfactory and and I don't think a lot of people think about that stuff, when it comes to game day because I think I think a lot of people just see like just add everything and it'll be the better game it doesn't work that way and I think that video explains pretty well why it doesn't work that well that way as well not just like listing what it is did you say no to blueprints at one point I'm not sure if we ever said like no we never said no we always said, who knows maybe you'll probably you could probably find a clip somewhere I was saying no but like my understanding for the longest time what we've been really careful to say was that we've had multiple discussions about it we revisit it every now and then and it it is it it had always leaned towards no we don't want it no we don't want it no we don't want it but it was a conversation that kept coming up again and again and again and no one was ever going to say we're not gonna have it because it was always somewhat interesting right it was always viable it was always there was always merits to it and then eventually the team was like actually I think we do one yeah I don't yeah it was no like that's not something that we ever said a harsh no to I think I mean I think I said a harsh note of pipes though I will take that, it just makes it funnier though yeah and then there's even an article on, there's an article right when that was written by who was it yeah Jesus PC Gamer or maybe satisfactory lied to the community yeah search for that you get the article how satisfactory is developers is Rock Paper Shotgun that's yeah yeah yeah trick Their audience and why they loved it and it goes into a lot of the lore about, surrounding pipes in update three and how how amazing and big that moment was and at the end of it, it says, it says, so what so the person asked us what if this stunt leads satisfactious players to expect anything and everything from the game in the future we've had people say that, Varley says Jay says things like flying vehicles drones or whatever always come up and people have been like well in that case we're going to get our drones because we we say we're not going to add them and then Tim says I don't think we're gonna get them are we Mark and then Mark director Mark says maybe I don't know and then I say I said no to drones in the past so it makes sense that we'll add them yeah the next update we asked yeah but we didn't know we didn't know they were adding them at that time we genuinely okay yeah we didn't yeah because the next update was actually 3.5 so update four came like a year later we didn't know we're adding drones at that point good man yeah so like but- I feel like we've been very careful with our wording is like not say definite no on a lot of things we always say like we we probably not but we don't say definitely like no but there's definitely a few things that we definitely know definitely definitely definitely We're Not Gonna but are we there

>, but yeah those things in the video are things like that we we I'm 99.9999 sure we're not gonna add and and- I wanted to make really sure that if I was going to make a video that was gonna be you know like click baity or like Sensational in its title we're not adding these things that I wanted to be really sure that okay if we get if I'm gonna if I'm gonna bait you in like that I want to be really like serious about about like and and honest about what we do like I don't want to like bait you in and then like with you yeah, I don't want to play with you guys like that, anymore apparently I had no issue doing it in the past but I don't anymore, yeah make a part two of that video literally part two of that video has been added to our list of videos to make so there's something maybe a cooking around a brewing a brewing yeah, yeah
