> so I'm just going to grab a bunch of materials that I kind of need later down the line and one problem they're already kind of facing here is that I'm kind of running out of storage space, in my in my inventory so one neat thing another building that we can showcase it's called the molecular analysis machine very good I did it first track and, we just call it we just refer to it as the map in the game really so ma'am yes ma'am, and there's one so so the mam is essentially like a research tree where you can like unlock more stuff, in the game since I've unlocked the color gun here and there's one particular thing that I want is this inflated pocket dimension which just gives me more, inventory space essentially and for that we need some requirements we need some copper, wire and some reinforced iron plates and some canterium ingot which I also just happen to have lying around, I don't have any inventory space for it though so I'm just gonna pick this up amazing so I'm gonna start researching this it will take two minutes and while that is happening we can prep a little bit elsewhere I'm gonna remove that another thing you can do in the mam by the way is, if you go exploring you can find these like hard drives right and, you can analyze them in the mail and they unlock alternate recipes and we'll sort of talk a little bit more about alternate recipes a little later but, it's all done in the man yes yes hardest pockets indeed
