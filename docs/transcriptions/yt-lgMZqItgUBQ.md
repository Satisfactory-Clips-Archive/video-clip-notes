### Transcript

> I'm assuming the idea for water currents never came to be right, that's not necessarily true yeah so some of you might know that I did a video with, Ben our technical artist once and he showed off a bunch of like water updates like waterfall updates as well as like water currents that would push things along, he did those things and we showed that like like a year and a half ago or something it was a long time ago is it even two years ago it's a long time and it just hasn't come to be yet I'm not exactly sure why but my understanding is that it has not been scrapped and it will be coming so it might be that it we're waiting on like World Branch updates could be is my guess maybe I should just follow up on this I actually am really curious about it so I'll leave a note here Ben's water and I'll try and I'll try and figure it out
