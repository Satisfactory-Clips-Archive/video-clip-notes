> in regards to satisfactory music is it all drm free in regards to youtube vods including trailer music or is there any limitation to those tracks so in-game music is totally fine no worries there at all um when it comes to youtube videos that we put out though uh sometimes music is licensed sometimes um we make our own um so it's kind of hard to to uh like don't take for granted that all the music on our youtube videos are drm free we also use like epidemic sometimes um which is like if you have an epidemic set license then you're good but if you don't then you get ads on your video but they won't get taken down or you won't get any like dmca claims anything like that um so like in-game stuff totally fine um don't worry about that don't worry about streaming the game either with the music like you can totally have the in-game music blasting um so yeah that's yeah but like i i guess one thing is like we sort of don't mind if you're using that stuff within the context of satisfactory it's kind of a bit weird if you just take our music and slap it on stuff that's completely unrelated uh i don't think we're gonna do anything about it but like yeah but if you're making satisfactory content you could just go right ahead
