> can you tell us okay this is a question we get very often can you tell us if we're going to be having two exits on the miners or if we're going to rebalance we haven't decided yet it's uh yep that's the short answer we haven't decided yet we don't know it the problem the underlying problem is that we don't know if we can introduce mark six conveyor belts or not um due to a few technical reasons i sometimes explain this but i'm not going to do it today because ah exhausted already don't need to go into it yeah um so we haven't decided yet either we'll do like you know two exits on mark three minor or we'll uh add mark six conveyor belts or we'll do like a rebalance of the entire game maybe and change surveillance but i don't know which one we will go with those are the options we have yep
