> is console confirmed to satisfactory, it's not confirmed so there's no rough time we we just don't know it's not like a yes or no thing we just don't think about it we're too busy, getting the windows version of the game working for those of you who want the game on console want to know why, having maintaining the game on different platforms, comes with a massive overhead, so that we would be putting in so much time and resources into, making the game run on all the platforms, making sure that the certification and all that kind of stuff is done for console as well, all of this time that could go into actually making the game and making the decisions we need to do for the game and adding features or whatever and we would rather finish the game and then maybe get it over, on console rather than focus on console anytime like now and then just make very very slow progress on the actual game itself
