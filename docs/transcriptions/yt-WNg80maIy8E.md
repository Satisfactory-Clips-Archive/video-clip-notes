### Transcript

> I saw a question about if we miss being developers chase do you miss being a developer are they community manager aren't community managers developers don't stop no no no no no take it back rewind rewind I saw one recently like if you use any tools like on real engine or things you're not a developer yeah cause you're using it like only people who program are developers they're just like what about the artists and animators I think the question was actually do you miss programming yeah yeah programming right yeah yeah no I understand, I don't I don't miss it no I mean like there are times where I'm like I could program but if I could like choose right now whether I want to switch back to being a full-time programmer I don't no same I do sometimes I get like a little urge to be like I want to do a small little thing like because it's very different working on like a big game like satisfactory and just making like a little prototype with like little dots running around and just shooting or something like it's it's, or like a little system that generates the whole thing like it's, yeah that that I thought about like if yeah like if we ever moved on from satisfactory we would have to go through a prototype phase and I'm like I'm thinking like would I would I want to jump on and program and help out there do like fun gameplay prototypes that could be really fun that's a really I haven't thought about that yeah yeah that's the truth
