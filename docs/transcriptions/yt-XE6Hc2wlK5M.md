> I just want to say you and jace and the dev team did a tremendous job it weren't for satisfied to distract from the monotony of my dissertation last year I would have finished so thank you, glad you liked the game that goes for anyone I got whoever whenever people send me like nice messages about the game- I get a little bit emotional, but I really- I'm glad that people like that what we do I know there's definitely, an amount of people that don't like the work that me and jase do but, but you know most people are super kind and super nice and I'm glad that you know what we're doing is is what people like essentially I'm glad that we do something in the right direction can I send you a nice message about our time together if it's if it's safe for work wait no no no that doesn't incriminate me at all, yeah sure chris wait did I say too much god oh no it's a bit guys don't worry about it or is it no no no no no, anyways I'm sorry I read this comment wrong and someone were like we love this game as of like but we don't like you and chase oh dude the determinant is you no don't worry about it don't forget any people say nasty things wouldn't bother if they weren't emotionally invested in the game I think some people definitely say stuff without like being invested in in things as well you know because there's there's always there's always going to be someone like epic store whatever I don't care about satisfactory you guys suck oh blah you know but I, one thing that, what's his name it's gonna come to me it's like a sneeze chris, the dude from

> no man's sky, he said in a talk like that he did at I think it was a ted talk actually or maybe it wasn't might have been a gcc talk sean murray that's the one, he said that like at the at the you know when they got like all that hate as to like how poorly they communicated you know how they wanted to run the game, he was sort of like stressed out about that but then he sort of started listening to the people that actually playing the game it's like the majority of all the negativity came from people that actually weren't invested in the game he didn't own the game and stuff like that so once they started listening to like their community itself they got actually a lot of positive stuff said about the game and by focusing on like but what are the people saying that are good and like listen to their feedback you know that's how they made that comeback story essentially, because they they focused on just like the people that around them that are actually invested in the game and do want the best for the game you know and I think that that definitely even though we haven't had like really we definitely haven't had the same, you know satisfactory has been positive response since pretty much day one, like nobody really has anything said and it's do majorly better that the game is just mostly like when we were exclusive whatever blah blah blah anyways, I that that is definitely something that that I think about a lot where it's important to remember like who who is investing in what you do and, like those are the people who are you should trust those people more you can still listen to the haters but to to a certain extent but you want to listen to the people that actually are invested and care about the game you know and those are the type of people that will show up on stream and stuff like that you guys are always super positive and stuff yeah yeah we we definitely it's it's so hard it's so hard to okay it's so hard to be like, how do I how do I phrase this it's so wild for me to be on this side of things of like miss when when people are like sharing misinformation and stuff like that or like making up about you like people are saying like I can't think of an example right now but it's so wild when people are coming up with stuff about how like oh no but you only went epic exclusive because blah and we actually know the truth you know we we were the ones who made the decision so while being on this side of this because we can be like no that's not true and then someone reads that like they could just be lying like it's so hard to to, to sometimes convince people because you're never gonna be able to convince everyone and you know from our point of view we are always thinking about like how can we make the best game possibly because we do believe that if you make a really good game the sales will come from that right and maybe that's not entirely true like 100 true, for everything because I do think you know there's there's a certain amount of luck there's a certain amount like how you also market it and I mean a huge amount of how you market it actually but you know for the most part like the core thing the core principle we have when we're working on the game is that the game needs to be good and if the game is good then much will follow after right so that's that's what we're making most of our decisions around right and then we have like community side how do we make people happy, and but you know if if we've just focused on like doing everything that was on the keyway side or everything that people wanted on steam forms or whatever it would be a kind of weird game you know it would be sort of a mishmash of everything so like there's a certain amount of like trust between us and everyone playing the game so like you know you guys sort of have to trust that we do want what's best for the game and that, you know the decisions we make you know even though maybe they don't make sense for everyone because there's a lot of different people that want different things out of the game we try to accommodate as many as we can but you know can't please everyone essentially and we really do try to to make as good as a game as possible so yes that was a long rant about nothing, game has given me sanity through some really difficult times this year I'm glad to hear I've always did tim sweeney pay you to say that exactly like how you can never know you'll never know maybe tim sweeney does, maybe tim sweeney is on my paycheck or wait the other way around yeah whatever,

> but but but honestly like I am speaking from from like it is true that like when me and jace are talking about stuff we're mostly talking you know from ourselves as people rather than like our corporation is explaining things to you in the way that will we think you want to hear right we we want to make a cool game obviously we want to be able to sustain ourselves making this game so obviously sales do matter we live in a capitalistic society right so there's no getting around that but I think you know at the core our studio really focuses on on just what is best for the game anyways, I just love reading just random like golf sucks in the middle of every like all the endearing messages I see, that's so funny is that no it's not it used to be epic exclusive the game is on steam and humble bundle as well, but at the start when we launched the game we were epic exclusive and yeah so that's actually a good example because we we were exclusive because we got such a good deal with epic right like they pretty much like said like here's a bunch of money and just up front no no no apart from us being epic exclusive right but like and and that really helped the game too I think like the fact that we were so successful in the epic game store I think, helped the game become popular as well I think and then people were like because we didn't decide that we would I can't remember exactly what the deal was but I think most most people get that offer where like you're exclusive for at least a year and then there's an offer to like renew it or whatever and I think we we always decided like okay we'll see what happens after a year maybe we'll stay on epic or maybe we'll go on steam or whatever and we sort of decided like a month after that deal was over but a lot of people took it as like why didn't you say anything about no getting out of the epic exclusivity deal and we were just like because we actually didn't we hadn't decided at that point and that's one of the things where like people make up conspiracy theories about how like no they just want to make money and lie to everyone and blah blah it's so wild being on this side of that conversation because we know what's true but us saying on a public forum like no but this is this is our opinion right it's it's so wild to me and it's so hard to explain that to people, because even the fact the notion of explaining it you know is confusing
