### Transcript

> friday there will be a teaser how much do you both play satisfactory I don't play it pretty much at all outside of work and then even on work I don't play it that much anymore, but I have been streaming it here I played it yesterday on live on twitch right here and I'll try play I'll try streaming again later this week yeah and I think I man I don't feel like I play it at work either because the only the only reason I have for booting it up is to verify that what I'm telling people is true when asking people ask me stuff and, to capture footage when we make teaser trailers or like content for our channel or stuff like that so I don't really play it I just like cheese it out and just build something be like this is this is a thing and then I send it to linus and then it makes a cool teaser trailer out of it
