### Transcript

> doing all this stuff so we're gonna be talking about the spider coast mainly and, a little bit of the process of that goes into making things so but for this I think we we hannah was on stream a couple of weeks ago I think we talked a lot about stuff there how like the the spider coast came together from like stuff that we already kind of had exactly apart from like the coral stuff yeah and then you just kind of like put it together but usually how do we usually when we've been creating new biomes what is the sort of process that goes into to to that, what we usually did I mean for for, the spy course which was obviously an empty playing field, it's fully new it was just empty and, sorry and the swamp that we were kind of, unhappy with it felt like yeah it's not done yet we have to polish that up, we essentially looked into what what kind of biome are we missing or what do we want there I mean inspire cos we need obviously it's a coastal region, layout-wise so what kind of coastal regions are there what can we have and yeah and we we collect a lot of stuff like in like like, a lot of inspirations and everything in references real world stuff what could we have and then of course the question is what can we have what should we have what's the library that we have yeah how much can we get away without adding anything exactly without question yeah without creating too many new assets because we also yeah we also don't want to spend like another one and a half years on a small biome so how can we get, the the most out of it with what what we had so we yeah we did a lot of like reference, references inspirations a few paint overs looking for color schemes what and the overall vibe what should be the vibe of the place yeah exactly yeah and initially we went through a whole list of coral assets that we had there was a whole bunch of random corals made at different times of the development some of them were pretty atrocious yeah some of them were nice so they made it some of them are like even I think mega scans but of like these like little oh yeah little tiny like statues of coral that we have yeah in the past we had those scans yeah and they were real messy yeah so we were like we were never cleaned up they're just all in the bin yeah we we essentially went through the the graphical attic and we dusted off stuff yeah exactly like looked in boxes like what's this we all know this is terrible yeah open boxes and then quickly close it again and shove it into the back of the attic again it's like and one fun part about the corals actually was that one of the corals had a really pretty shape so we wanted to keep it but it was kind of broken a bit as a as a 3d mesh so what we ended up doing is- I just kind of merged it with the coral trees like the platform trees that are there and it became like a weird fungus that's growing on those trees and just that made it a bit more like fun looking and artsy so exactly saving some small things yeah you gotta be creative with the things here yeah I think what we what we yeah what we also tried a lot was not just visually looking at which color wise which assets fit together but also trying to make up like a narrative with the existing like what how do they work together these plants why do these grow next to each other what is the basic basic biology behind it so because you only need to get a little chunk of believability and then well the rest is space magic it's fine but but if you know it you've got to make something that's pretty good we are I've got to say we're pretty good we have we have a decent amount of space magic like I believe every sci-fi thing should have but it makes sense we we have tried to make it make sense yeah and just to make it believable exactly yeah so so I'm going to be a
