> will when you extract nitrogen will you attract more monsters or alien creatures I actually talked, to stefan or current ceo or new ceo about that today because he was kind of thinking that it would be interesting if you start like blasting away with this record that creatures in the area get kind of annoyed and they come towards that location but for now we don't have any strict plans for that so maybe that's something that we want to look into in the future I think for some players that will be interesting for others they will think it's really annoying so yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't bet on it for now that's something that we will do I guess if we did do it it would make sense to like add pacifist mode maybe yeah I mean that's something we want to do anyway yeah so if we have that option it might be more valid to start doing more aggressive things, with the with the game world as well but until then I wouldn't really want to push this kind of things into the game because it will just piss off a lot of players yeah more fun for a large part of our player base it's a very tricky balance you guys, with the whole thing I know it's a meme now when everyone asks me about tower defense but, it is it's a tricky balancing thing because a lot of people play the game and they don't like the the

> the the combat aspect of the game at all like there are even I've seen posts on steam where people are like unless unless you have a passive mode I'm not buying this game like and then there's the other cam that's like if you don't add tower defense I'm not buying this game so like it's a really tricky balance there, if you did do something like that where like yeah when you start extracting nitrogen then suddenly you kind of do get attacked which no other building does in the game so far, and I mean we have plans to add like the you know the crab boss feature thing at some point which I don't know I'm not sure exactly how that would work or like how that would behave in the world if that will have a big impact or not, so there's still like the game is still in early access it's still gonna change but we do we do hear the people that we do listen to everyone and like we want to retain the game correct me if I'm wrong mark but we do want to retain the game as it is now so that you don't feel like if you play the game when it was released in early access that it's a completely different experience when it actually we hit 1.0
