> which reminds me holy, all right look back to the video I made last last week where we talked about some of the known issues in the game, remember that I talked about there's a psa by the way there is a there's an issue on steam specifically where sometimes when you play the game you like run into weird glitches and like graphical issues between the updates, and we found that a lot of the issues is because like a faulty patch or something when you're downloading the patch from from steam so verifying your game files solves a lot of like graphical issues or any like issues you have with the game, so if you're running into issues with the game make sure to verify your game files and we did reach out to valve about this issue and they got back to us saying that there is maybe potentially something wrong on their end, so what they kind of asked me to ask you guys about is what if we have epic version well then you're in the clear is if you've run into an issue in satisfactory where you've like the game crashes or something and and or you've had a graphical issue or why is my nose just like any kind of issue that has been resolved from you verifying your gave files gay files game files if you've had any issue being resolved use by verifying game files please reach out to me on discord, if you want to help valve figure out what's wrong, so I will tell you how to do it you essentially need to create like a support ticket on on steam, but reach out to me on discord if if, if you've had this issue and it has been resolved by you verifying the game fast because they kind of need like your your logs or whatever on steam to be able to track down exactly what the issue is or something like that so just wanted to say that real quick
