> hey there my name is snoot and i'm one of the community managers at coffee stain studios and today we're going to talk about the future so last week we launched update 4 on early access and we're super pleased with the update and you guys really showed up because you broke our concurrent player numbers on both steam and epic so thank you so much for showing up it's really surreal to see like your game be part of like the top most played games on steam uh on that list so so thank you so much for showing up and playing our game so this video is going to be a little bit about some of the known issues with update 4 and i'm going to address some of the things about it um and we're also going to talk a little bit about like what's coming next for us but before i do that i want to make like a little bit of a psa about an a very known issue and i want to do it early in the video so that people catch it on steam specifically we've seen a lot of issues that are related to the actual like patching of the updates uh something with the patching system on steam we don't quite know uh we're gonna reach out to valve and see what's going on because we don't see anything that's wrong in our build system and we don't see this happening on the epic end so we're not quite sure what's happening there it's something with the download or something so if you are running into issues and you're all playing on the steam version make sure to verify your game files you do this by right clicking on the game and then uh how do you do it you right-click on the game you hit properties you go to local files and you hit verify game files and that should check the files to make sure that they're like up to date and they match what you're supposed to have on your computer um and if if it doesn't match then it will download the correct files etc etc and fix it up for you we've noticed that a lot of graphical issues that are people having has been a result of that like wonky installation or something um and verifying your game files have like solved like nine out of ten of those issues so make sure to verify your game files and make sure to let people know if they're running into these type of issues that they make sure to verify their game files because that can resolve it in a lot of cases so one big surprise that a lot of people have been uh kind of been facing coming back from maybe up to three and then playing on update four again and if you haven't been keeping up to date with all our like state of dev and all that jazz which by the way we stream every week on tuesdays at 4 p.m cst where we talk about what we're doing with the game is the uh big surprise that like there's a bunch of power changes to the game uh people are running into to their power grids like going offline or blowing fuses and the biggest reason for this is because of power changes that we made to the game and if you're wondering why we changed power to be like this uh jace actually made a whole video exclusively talking about the power changes for update for check out the cards but tldr we found that the self-regulating aspect of the generators were a kind of redundant feature on most generators due to the game having infinite resources it also caused some confusion and conflicted with the way fuel production works after r3 with the polymer resin by product production and it also gives you guys a little bit more control in your hands uh such as with the power source and whatnot so i so i just copied jace's homework and i presented it as my own a plus plus plus plus plus a lot of people will point out that this is like an issue with pipes and like changes we've done to the pipes but we haven't actually made any changes to pipes or the way that fluid dynamics work or anything like that um most often when i've been talking to people about this it's mostly that the the power like setup isn't set up for like generators running at 100 capacity um so that's mostly what people are running into now there are a few pipe bugs i'm not gonna lie uh but for the most part when people are running into these kind of issues it's mostly because of their power setup hasn't been like accounted for 100 fuel consumption and not gonna lie this is confusing because one of the issues that we have with our fluid dynamics is that they're kind of hard to like teach and they're hard to like explain um we are kind of happy with how like the complexity of do fluid dynamics uh we don't want to really change that too much one issue we have is that it's kind of hard to like explain what's going on in the pipes etc etc so a lot of people are confused about that that's something we're probably gonna look into more in the future but just wanna say if you are finding the fluid dynamics confusing or if you wanna know more about it please check out our discord and like our steam forums and ask awake because people are really helpful in this regard and uh there are a bunch of tutorials on how pipes work um so i really recommend like reaching out to community and and ask for help because this is confusing and uh the best help out there are you guys honestly so just a speed round of another couple of known issues and some of the workarounds that we know right now so uh some people are having issues connecting to each other in the game this is really odd issue we're looking into it one known workaround in some cases if you are set with different time zones in your computer so you have different like time settings or something like that uh make sure you have the same ones when you try to connect each other sometimes that has actually solved it not sure why but that's been the case and uh if you're getting that like timeout error when you're trying to connect just retry like over and over again and eventually you'll be able to connect at least some people have reported that they've been able to connect eventually once they have tried and tried to try it over again on the topic of multiplayer bugs specifically there's also a very known multiplayer bug where foliage will not like disappear on clients sometimes now this is an issue that's been in the game since launch and sometimes it just like escalates during launches because something when we change make big changes it just appears again for some people the reason why that hasn't been fixed up until now is because the the fix for that is having to remake a big system when it comes to the foliage um and that's something that we haven't been able to dive into but we are going to be able to do that very soon so i hope in the next couple of updates maybe we'll be able to fix that i don't know fingers crossed and another problem that might seem trivial is that the name of the game and like the task manager has changed from like satisfactory to like ue4 or something something factory game or whatever it is uh and the icon is is not correct either this is actually a bummer because it breaks third party application support for the game so some people have reported that they can't play the game on geforce now uh we're aware of that issue as well we have a fix for it internally we just haven't been able to push it yet so hopefully that will happen very very very soon so those are just a few things that i wanted to bring up in this video right now there are obviously a bunch more the game is in early access uh we're working really hard on it we're trying to solve everything you guys uh please bear with us it'd be like it do but if there's anything else that you think is important to bring up or if you are running into issues or if you have any feedback about the game in general make sure to go to our questions site questions.satisfactorygame.com make sure to upvote any issues that you think are important make sure to post any issues that we run into and yeah try to tell us what's going on in your lives and another thing i want to just address real quick is that some people have been pointed out to us that mods are broken yes um that's not something we can do anything about so currently mods aren't officially supported so these are our modding community that have been working really hard on on fixing this and working on it and they're still working on it and i also want to say that if you're running into crashes and you have mods installed you're kind of on your own unfortunately because there's no way for us to verify crashes uh whether or not that's something because of the game itself or it's become something of mods currently like i think 80 of our crash reports are because of mods and if you are getting issues please reach out to the modding community about them so let's talk about the future now you might be asking yourself what's coming next and the answer to that question is i don't know there's still a few hot fixes we want to do for update four we're currently working on those and rolling them out as i mentioned before but we have been moving on to update five actually and that's like our next target here we're gonna work on update five but we don't know when that's coming out because we're kind of still figuring out what we wanna put in update five and how big update five is gonna be um and that's something that we're gonna be figuring out while we're working on update five essentially so we don't have like any news yet we are obviously gonna announce stuff once we can but it's still a little bit too early to like nail down exactly when it will happen or what it will contain it's it's gonna be sometime this year okay but we don't know like if update 5 is going to be a smaller update than update 4 or a bigger one or same size um or what that's going to entail etc etc so we're just gonna have to wait and see you guys all right that's gonna wrap it up for this week's video i hope you found it informational i hope you're enjoying update four and if you like this video then hit that like button or subscribe if you want to that's up to you don't let anyone tell you what you can and cannot do that's up to you anyways uh take care have fun and we'll see each other soon enough bye
