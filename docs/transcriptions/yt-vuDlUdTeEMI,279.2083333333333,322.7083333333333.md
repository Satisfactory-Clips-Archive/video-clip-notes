> guys honestly so just a speed round of another couple of known issues and some of the workarounds that we know right now so, some people are having issues connecting to each other in the game this is really odd issue we're looking into it one known workaround in some cases if you are set with different time zones in your computer so you have different like time settings or something like that, make sure you have the same ones when you try to connect each other sometimes that has actually solved it not sure why but that's been the case and, if you're getting that like timeout error when you're trying to connect just retry like over and over again and eventually you'll be able to connect at least some people have reported that they've been able to connect eventually once they have tried and tried to try it over again on the topic of multiplayer bugs
