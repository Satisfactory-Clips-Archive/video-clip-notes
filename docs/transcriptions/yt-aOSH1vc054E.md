### Transcript

> all the crazy math all the time yeah it kind of makes me curious because i'm i'm thinking of like you mentioned the alternate recipes for instance, it's it's i'm super curious like how many actually use the alternate recipes in our game like specific because i know there are specific production lines like the turbo fuel one for instance is very popular but like there's so many like it feels like such an advanced tier and when people aren't complaining about because we're going to talk about this a little bit later but the the like fuel kind of buff that we did that changed how turbo fuel like how people approach turbo fuel stuff like that, i'm, yeah it can be a bit messy that way i wanted to say something but now i forgot it good oh yeah but with the alternate recipes i mean there is some of them that are kind of catered towards for example you as well snoot because there are recipes that are actually there to make it easier yeah but they sacrifice other things like there's recipes that are purposely made to have a nicer ratio with other recipes that they that they are required for, you have that one reinforced iron plate recipe that outputs a lot of iron plates per minute so you have to make like smaller setups effectively but as a downside it actually takes a little bit more raw resources so it goes like 10 up or something in in cost effectively but that shouldn't really matter to a player that isn't playing really high end and even the players that are playing really high and tend to actually take that one i think now because it's just so strong and, with with how much it outputs per minute tricky and then there's alternate sps as well like the screw one where you just cut out the the rod for example so you make it straight from ingots so there is recipes there as well to support lower level play right
