> do you know if there's a console command to show the chief tick rate the thing about the tick rate is like isn't there like different tick rates like there's like multiplayer tick rates yeah it's multiplied like I don't know which ticker you're referring to yeah I don't know if they're all the same or not I think they are they are different that's the thing they're all different we have factory tick and we have and factory tick is tied to your frame rate no it's not actually sorry let me I don't think it is no it's tied to your game thread, but if you're afraid here's the thing if your frame thread like gets, stalled by say the rendering thread then you can see precision issues so it's technically tied to the to the frame rate but it's not really but it it can be in certain situations but yeah it's- I'm sure it's 30. you can you can actually look it up, in the config file I'm pretty sure it says in one of the config files there you are there's your answer because you can change it down the topic files can you, yes I can oh boy if you know the crashes I don't know oh it actually doesn't it doesn't like if if your tick rate is too high then it will just mess up with the the regular bandwidth and it will just make the game slow so it doesn't actually like I mean it does cause issues but if you know what you're doing with the tick rate then that makes sense but as soon as you change any of the like, network quality settings then it will overwrite that [ __ ] or it should at least
