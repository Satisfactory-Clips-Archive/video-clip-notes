> how's the engine update going it's going okay, there it's it's like a little bit annoying because we did get some oh no- I you'll get up there fast jase don't worry about it, we did notice a few, like when we did the engine upgrade we there were a few things that we knew we were going to get like, some improvements on, and then and but then there were some changes that on epic did with the rendering pipeline that kind of like backfired it a little bit in other parts of the game and that's I guess that's how game development is, you never get anything for free I guess it never just works except video games, except this jump that you're about to make hey all right try first try first try zero, so that's like what we're this period now until update four we're like really cracking down on like fixing the stuff that kind of like hello oh no oh no oh there's a gap on the other side of it are you kidding me oh game really really outside in chat right now hold on really oh nice, what was I talking about yeah so, what was I talking about the, sorry yeah no so we're talking about engine upgrade so yeah there's a there's a bunch of stuff that we, we are fixing currently until update four so hopefully everything will be resolved, until the update comes out on early access so to speak, then we'll hopefully have caught up until like where we want the engine upgrade to be so that everyone can enjoy the performance improvements and whatnot
