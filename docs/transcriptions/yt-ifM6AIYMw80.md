### Transcript

> give a technical presentation of light simulation trains etc yes, i have been planning to do that for a long time it's, things have been getting in my way, but i've been meaning to to do that i've been meaning to do one about lights either with or without ben if ben wants to be in that he can be in it it would be super good if ben was in it because he's the one who implemented most of the functionality for lights if not all of the functionality for lights but yeah i'm i'm really hoping we can get some technical videos out, soon-ish, before we start like teasing update five stuff because, i i don't think you guys realize how much like work goes into you know some of the solutions we've made, so it would be really cool to like just make a bunch of tech demos or tech videos about some of the implementations we've done jace has done like a few of these also with ben i believe where we showcase like some of the impostor sprites and stuff like that, so we i i just i just really want to make more of that so, probably gonna happen in this soon near future we'll see
