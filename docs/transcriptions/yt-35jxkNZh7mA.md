### Transcript

> I feel like this is probably the decision before so I apologize repeat question but is there a possibility of altering the terrain in certain circumstances for example is there a way to make tunnels no so you can't really deform the terrain that's not really a thing that's possible now and I don't really see if that's going to be a thing in the future
