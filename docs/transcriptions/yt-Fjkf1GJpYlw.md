### Transcript

> actually one piece of general info that I would like to know as well because- I saw this question and I don't know the answer and I think you answered on stream but that was the state of the, miners Mark Z miners people are oh yeah the question that we get almost every single stream is, what's the deal with the Mark III miners because you can only get like 780 items per minute out of the miner but the miner supports 1200 items per minute what's the deal like what's going on yeah so, I actually did I believe I followed this up this was the first follow-up that I did but we can do it again since it always comes up, and that is that we do have a solution for the MK3 Miner output we do have a plan, yeah all I can say is that we we do have a plan so there have been many suggestions that have suggested make Foster belts rescale the numbers add a second output, so you know there's many things and and we have decided on what we plan on doing I just kind of tell you what we plan on doing I'm sorry I just can't, yeah but that also brings up the question about the, pipe issue where it's like it's really hard to run 600 cubic meters of fluids through pipes right like they never run at that thing because there's like weird math issues and and things like that, so I also asked about that like do we plan on what do we want to do around that and so one option is obviously rescaling the numbers so that like the math will work with whatever numbers but also it seems like the interest is to find, and fix the inaccuracy issues and keep the numbers as they are but we'll see how that goes we'll see how that goes interesting maybe it doesn't work because because the pro the thing that I Was Heard internally was that like here's the programmers on one side here's like the designers on this side designers like 600 the program was like that's not gonna work and then no we do it yeah yeah yeah as always the constant the constant push and pull between, programs and design that's cool that's nice that we're at least gonna spend the time to to fix that because it could just be the case where like we just decided oh it's too much effort to look into it we just decide to change the numbers, so it's nice at least that we invest the time into looking into it cool
