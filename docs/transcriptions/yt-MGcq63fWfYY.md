> well that would be two players per car I don't think so what do you know it's never coming back do you know was that ever a thing in development yeah yeah yeah it was do you remember what was the was there a technical reason it was weird because I was working on the the vehicles at that time and then I realized that I couldn't get a second person in there and I was like hey what's wrong they're like yeah we moved it I was like oh really no one told me okay that was it that's all I knew, I don't I don't know I can't remember the reason why I'm pretty sure mark has told me the reason once before yeah but I don't remember I have a feeling because I have a feeling it's one of those things where like this seems like it shouldn't be a big deal and then there's some weird technical issue or like something that we I don't know if it was a technical issue I don't I don't I don't know for sure so yeah just yeah we'll leave it at that I guess- I don't know this is one of those things where I like I should ask someone that knows this and I keep putting it off because I keep forgetting to ask someone who knows about this
