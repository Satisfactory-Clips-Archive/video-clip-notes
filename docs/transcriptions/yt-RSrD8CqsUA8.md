> what are swatches the swatches are the colors the color settings right so when you open the customizer you have the, when you pick colors swatches are like those settings right and the swatches are most of the most everyone except one swatch that you can pick are, oh yeah that's true it's true it's limited to the the the rgb scale that we have, but, the swatches are like, instance so when you place a swatch or like when you're using a color and painting it and you change the swatch it will paint it change the color on the building as well so you can like paint like if you want to paint your factory in like a three color scheme or whatever you can just paint it and then you can just in the menu switch it around and see whichever colors you like the best but the custom swatch is like when you paint it it will stay that color forever and that was a big limitation in the game before where you would only have like 16 swatches so you could only have 16 colors at the time but now you can have a lot more thanks for explanation we're probably gonna make a video about this, to explain this a bit further, because yeah like i said it feels i don't think everyone has gotten just how powerful that custom swatch is, so yeah like you can make like really, detail like pixel art now whereas before you only had like 16 colors now you have like as many as you want so it's it's pretty dope it's pretty dope not gonna lie
