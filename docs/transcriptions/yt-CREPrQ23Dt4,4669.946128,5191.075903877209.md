> do you guys have any fun blueprints you want to try and make, I wonder who I actually want to check one thing I wonder if we fixed this bug checking up yeah but it's actually kind of relevant because like can I say something about bugs real quick so I just found some, railroad tracks I would have avoid them immediately in the internet printer yeah there's, some issues running them and at least one crash can result if you connect from an outside track to an inside track it's not it's not supposed to be possible but you can currently so you know what can I complain about something I have I have an advantage here because I'm on this side and I'm playing the game and I am like literally you literally talking what there's a bug that's been in the game for a long time oh okay you know how we have like, and this isn't directed you I know yeah I know it looks like I'm like

> what was I talking about yeah so so you know how we have like Bill and release it's like a future in the game, there's one item in the game that ignores it and slatters it's ladders you have to press twice wow see if I release that's literally unplayable though still but I don't use build on release like your together game designers, I think this is a very different implementation on this one oh yeah I also made this before zooping Yes actually okay fun story actually zooping came from this moment of building the ladders you told me this yeah yeah so like the name zooping came from Mark being like building a ladder and be like Zoop yeah I think we were like talking about how it should function and I tried to just explain it without it yeah I need the soup all right, let's see okay so let's build, because one thing that I found when I was testing this is that every every blueprint is like still based on like the 4x4, like, origin so like when you're placing blueprints they're always based on like the full, scale of it yes and I'm curious if that's still the case or not, because there's, there's like a very specific, shout out to to DC van who taught me with this by the way, oh they fixed it yeah nice job, this was very buggy or maybe oh maybe hell yeah it's funny you guys don't you guys know what's happening yeah it looks great snoon yeah, put that right up there you guys have no idea how buggy this game can be sometimes like you you think it's bad on experimental you ain't seen okay I'm just saying, but that's how it is when you're developing it no but, so so one really cool use case here is like if you're building, did I mess it up I think I messed it up all right close enough- I went too far but you get the point so like there's a lot of builds where you do like, static kind of stuff like this and it's like you know to make an angled pillar like this it's like a bunch of different steps you have to take, it's nice that you can just be like, curved killer very nice suit and then we'll put that in the I never named the category, oh I should eat the auto save dude if you've tried to save a blueprints never mind let's go, best category and then we'll put like the car apply and then we'll create another category whoa we'll call this the second best and we'll use the thumbs up I don't know if it was meant did you mention it that you can share these too yeah yeah okay in the video yeah yeah I even showed the the oh okay which maybe doesn't make sense because like we're on a div building like the directories because do they create the directories for the bloopers as well on the library yeah it'll be under the save game and then Blueprints and then under the session name so okay multiple sessions you need to move the blueprints you want to the session gotcha okay yeah it's not it's not Global because we didn't want people starting the game with all their blueprints but you can choose to move them over if you want yeah, curve filler apply changes save all right now it can be like description over here Hello friends dude I'm gonna use this so much I'm gonna put it on my heart bar on six because I leave five for some reason oh I forgot the ladder try this too because this didn't work when I, when I test this that didn't work yeah I didn't it created like a new one oh yeah that should be fixed oh oh oh it's oh this this is the same moment I had like when I made the video you have to like create the or I know I can just move it actually this is that was not scripted in the video by the way some people said that it was it 100 wasn't, I was legit like what just happened where'd it go yeah we're probably gonna change that so it's not it's like if you load a blueprint and save it again it's going to be in the same directory, do we have a quick key for the blueprints, no right now yeah because we have like X and you know q and Z available is it gotta expect a hole oh yeah I think so I think we we had something on there and then we removed it for a long time, now it's like a map yeah man yeah nothing says math like Z yeah yeah yeah we would expect to M because yeah, see here yeah nice yeah so now that issue is no longer there, cool I love how am I just like pointing out the that you guys will never see we got to remove a beam over here important save again this is something to set the category add blueprint here yep that's kind of Jackie isn't it yeah I guess but just try to add and see what happens it should it should game crashed yeah yeah just kind of a weird interaction all right and then, yeah and I can just as many as you want baby like that's so much that's so much nicer than just having to do that thing over and over again I had this in one of my builds where I did exactly this whatever but it actually lines it would actually look good but, it was such a pain in the ass to do this same with the curved building and yeah everything like this because you can do so much cool stuff yeah and then you only have to do it once and that happened yeah you just copy paste it yeah

>, and I know a lot of people feel like that oh it's just four by four it's like nothing it's like pretty much useless, but- I just I used to agree kinda but I kind of disagree now when I tried it out a little bit because like you can you can do really like even if you can't put like a power plant and like hook it up you can still do like the hookup sort of in in the, in the blueprint so like just placing the power plants and then a nuclear power plants and then just do like pulled pipes and like whatever kind of constellation you want to do there through the blueprint like that still saves a ton of time you know being able to do, this kind of stuff where like say you have like more four belt or whoops so you do do this right, and then you just pull a belt from here and then just do like you know stack make a bus or whatever you know stack this stuff, you know doing this in the blueprint and just doing it once and then figuring out like where to apply that in your build is is very it's still like in the in the, in the like atmosphericasm here but like The Same Spirit as the game you're still you know making figuring things out how it applies to like the 3D and how you can design the pieces yeah a little bit yeah exactly, rather than making a whole base I found a bug killer yeah there'll be a couple of those we don't talk about that actually there was it was actually a pain to get the, just the conveyor polls to be able to be placed on the edge because they don't want to be wait what is this is confusing ceiling man yeah but if you don't aim it at the ceiling yeah yeah I just thought it was funny that it was like yeah is that a regular it is a bit confusing yeah, but let's let's talk
