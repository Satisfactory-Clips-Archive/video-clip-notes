> um would you make the map spherical in later updates to make it more like a celestial body so that you can like walk right around it i don't think that's going to happen no i don't think that's going to happen pretty sure it won't happen no the uh so animal crossing comes to mind but when you say that because but that's not also not spherical that's just a way to render it they it's still a plane and then they curve it when they render it we could i guess technically maybe do something like that where i'm not saying the borders need to mind as well yeah exactly where the borders like meet so yeah but it's still a plane you just like transport it and then we trick you sort of that's that's technically doable but it's a lot i mean it's it's open water right on the distance yeah we could just make it so that you just wrap around the other side and be like look it's a plane and you're on an island it's it's a planet that only has one big island yeah the whole planet one big island i mean that's kind of how subnautica did it it's like it's it's deep water everywhere but you're in that part the one part of the island or the planet where you can actually don't have to dive so deep or whatever but yeah i don't think we're gonna do that
