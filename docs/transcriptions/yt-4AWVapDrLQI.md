> Snutt: Fuck.
>
> Jace: Uhh...
>
> "Having already been successful in both [Epic](../topics/retail/epic-store.md) and [Steam](../topics/retail/steam-store/steam-release.md) [early access](../topics/retail/early-access.md) launches, what is- what is your incentive for making to [1.0 release](../topics/satisfactory-updates/pending/satisfactory-1-0.md)... versus taking the money you already have and running?"
>
> Uhh... the incentive is that we are making a game, and we want to finish it because we care about it.
>
> Uhh...
>
> Making something good is very important to us-
>
> Snutt: Yeah
>
> Jace: -the- the- the art side the creation side of making games is very important to us.
>
> Uhh...
>
> The fact that we made money because people liked it is great- Uhh- but we still got a job to do.
>
> Not like- not just for people who like- not just for people who bought the game; First of all we- we sort of owe them- [laughing] a finished product-
>
> Snutt: [smiling] Yeah, yeah.
>
> Jace: -but- but also for us, we- we spent so much time doing this like why the hell would we just stop?
>
> That's crazy, people- we'd riot I think everyone would just riot,
>
> Snutt: Hmm.
>
> Jace: if some reason whoever would take make that decision.
>
> Snutt: Yeah.
>
> Jace: Uhm..
>
> Snutt: But it's also like you know even the the boring like...
>
> Jace: I would riot.
>
> Snutt: aspect of- like there are a lot of people that wouldn't- -don't want to play early access games, or like waiting for [1.0](../topics/satisfactory-updates/pending/satisfactory-1-0.md) to come out before they even start diving into it,
>
> Jace: Hmmhm.
>
> Snutt: and I- I'm one of those people like I didn't play [Factorio](../topics/off-topic/factorio.md) until it was 1.0.
>
> Jace: Yeah.
>
> Snutt: Uhm... so there's also that aspect, but yeah the- the bigger as- believe it or not like the bigger aspect is for us that we just want to finish it, like... it's...
>
> Jace: It's important to finish it.
>
> And I- you know like back when we started and decided to do early access, we didn't want to do [early access](../topics/retail/early-access.md)- -there was like a lot of pushback, we were like: "we don't want to be one of those games stuck in early access" and we still don't, like it's so important to not be stuck here, like I- I don't know- like I don't want to- I don't want to throw shade, but I think I'm just going to end up throwing shade, but.. uhmm- but it's just like... I feel like this for me,
>
> Snutt: [Laughs]
>
> Jace: and I- and I think it's a shared sentiment, we just don't want to be one of those games. That's the thing. There are a lot of early access games out there who stay early access for a long time, and they're awesome- -they're actively developing, they're engaging with the community and that's fantastic. Uhm... but there are too many that just don't. [Laughs]
>
> Snutt: Yeah.
>
> Jace: And we don't want to be that so-
>
> Snutt: And we also- yeah we don't want to be stuck there for a long time either, like I think at some point we're gonna- -even though we have like so many ideas for Satisfactory I think at one point we're just gonna be like- "all right we got just gotta finish it at this point"
>
> Jace: Yeah, yeah.
>
> Snutt: fuck it- because I don't think uh we want us-
>
> Jace: Yeah.
>
> Snutt: -because like Wube was in was in early access for eight years with [Factorio](../topics/off-topic/factorio.md), and- and when we see that we're like
>
> "whoa that's so long we don't want to do that"
>
> Jace: [Shakes head]
>
> I don't want to be in early access for 8 years.
>
> Snutt: Yeah, yeah.
>
> Jace: I don't want to work on an early access game for eight years-
>
> Snutt: Yeah.
>
> Jace: -because there's no reason why we can't update it after [1.0](../topics/satisfactory-updates/pending/satisfactory-1-0.md)
>
> Snutt: [shrugs] Yeah.
>
> Jace: Like...
>
> So it's like it doesn't really change much,
>
> Snutt: Hmm.
>
> Jace: but we do want to say that we've got a finished game.
