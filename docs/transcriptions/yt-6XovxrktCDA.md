> will even come back next year, i think so i i my my i don't know actually but my guess is yes i think so, and, maybe we'll work more on it maybe we'll just do like a rerun of it maybe we'll update just like the advent calendar i don't know exactly what what what the event would look like next year, but i have a feeling that it's probably will be just like it will turn back on again, as if nothing happened next year if anything
