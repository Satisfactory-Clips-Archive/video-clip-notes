> i'm curious about the lack of dedicated services possibly because of the increasing larger numbers of server running uh so the reason why we haven't had it up at this point is because we just haven't made it uh but also because there are a bunch of like multiplayer issues that if you were playing a multiplayer like a dedicated server then those issues would make it so that nobody could progress so for example trains right so clients what they can't use them they can't drive them or something yeah and there's been cases where like there are bugs where sometimes you place a building and then only the server can remove it only the server can remove it so like you'd end up in a situation where like you've set up your your big factory line right and then that issue happens and then suddenly nobody can remove like a stray work bench or whatever in the middle of the whole thing and like all right then guess we have to redo the entire thing because nobody there's no host that can like fix that which there exists right now in the version this version of the game so we want to get that sorted out before we feel like it makes sense having a data coded server and then there's also like you know being having the sort of features that you kind of expect from a dedicated server like you know what if you want to download your save file you should be able to do that if you want to like hook like how should people connect uh how it's distributed that sort of stuff needs to also uh work that but also the the the the um
