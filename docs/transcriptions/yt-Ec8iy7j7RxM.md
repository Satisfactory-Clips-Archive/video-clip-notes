> did you get don't don't go away come back where'd you go did you get more reports that there are graphical glitch glitches when update four started since the release items are not rendered correctly on belt sometimes for me yo so this nine out of ten times when I get people to tell me this it's because they need to verify the game files because of the patching, the patch that you download sometimes like doesn't work or doesn't install everything correctly, so nine out of ten times when people say this to me it's because they need to verify their game files
