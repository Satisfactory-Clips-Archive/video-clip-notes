> can we have automated ladders that's fair, oh sorry I was like when I read that question automated ladders I thought the ladders themselves would be auto so like we extract like whatever, I don't know ladders are equipment and and the general consensus in the game is like equipment shouldn't isn't automated currently I don't know what the reasoning is behind that, but upload that on the keyway side if you if you want to be able to automate ladders or other equipment for that matter too I don't know I don't remember what the design decision was behind that, so I can't really say anything about it but, I don't know it was a lot curious I'd slide some slide your dm in there or something slide your upvote point whatever
