### Transcript

> run yep just got here didn't realize that stream today do you have a time frame on trains or trucks being fixed so uh those are two different issues there was a i can't remember what issues we have for trains the rest of the team know the issues better than i do so um just because i don't know doesn't mean they don't right but i do know that there was there was one issue with trains where like the uh the trains will like stop at a station and then just immediately go again and they wouldn't load or unload anything and that issue is being investigated now um and it seems like there is a temporary fix for that it's an issue when playing on as a client so if you're playing on dedicated servers for example everyone's a client there's an issue with building there and something to do with maybe the latency or something where uh when you build like a station or a platform or something it doesn't actually link up properly now there's a way to fix it you can just rebuild it and rebuild it by looking you know dead center at your target and then building it and don't move the mouse let it build for a second just make sure that all that information gets sent back and forth and then it should work um now obviously that's a temporary fix and we're looking for you know a better fix so that this issue just doesn't happen at all but that you know if you're running into issues where your train just stops and then just starts again without actually unloading anything you can just try rebuild your stations and see if that helps um as for the vehicles the yeah there's an issue with fueling and that is something that's being either looked into or i don't know maybe even fixed in the patch that's coming out now i have no idea
