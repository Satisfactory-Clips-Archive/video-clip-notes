### Transcript

> yeah okay so let's let's dive into the details okay so the thing with, tier eight is we had a vision of what tier 8 was going to be and we had, designed tier seven to be in a specific way so that it would lead into what we thought we wanted for tier viii but based on feedback, from you guys and what we've observed our vision for t8 has changed a little bit and what this means is there's going to be a lot of rework to tier seven as well to sort of justify that change so there's gonna be, not only just a bunch of new content but a bunch of changes to existing production lines and this means if you if you have a late game factory it's not really gonna work anymore I'm so sorry about that
