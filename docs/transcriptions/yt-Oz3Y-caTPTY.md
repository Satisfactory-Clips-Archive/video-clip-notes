### Transcript

> have you considered making actual habitual boosters so we don't have to resort to janky camps to speed up multiplayers i don't think so because i think uh one of the i remember i talked to mark about this once and i i'm pretty sure he said like even though it's this like weird funny thing we have to sort of like weigh the balance of the game right and he says like well you know they're a little janky to set up and they're a little janky in general they're not completely reliable in that they're not necessarily going to get you exactly where you want to be each time and they cost power i think for each tube right yeah they're very so so there's like a lot of actual trade-offs to using it and then you get this like crazy boost and so in that sense there's some balance to it um so i think you know we i guess we could maybe add like actual hypertube boosters that have some level of balance to it as well but i don't know what that would be but you know yeah i i i don't i don't i don't think so i don't i don't think it's needed like because because one possible way to do it is to do like you overclock the uh yeah the existing the the like input and output and then you we just check like okay if we want to apply this much force in the pipe how many entrances do you need to set up and then be like okay that's this much power and then we scale yeah that with that or something i don't know but i feel like if we wanted to do that we would have done it at this point because it's not doing this thing i just said isn't that hard to implement uh and and i guess it might be also be a little bit of like yo but it works now like you you have that feature in the game why should we why should we make that feature again instead of working on something that doesn't doesn't exist the justification is is if we wanted to be part of the game then we should make it obvious that you can do it because not ever like not everyone does it yeah and i guess when you think about how many people bought the game how many people are actually setting up like what percentage of people are actually setting up hyper tenants yeah it's got to be super low i don't know it's something for mark to uh evaluate when we get closer to 1.0 i guess if we feel like it's worth putting the development time to that um yeah but i think i think also partly we're kind of not proud but like we're a bit happy that fact that like there's a bit of emergent game design here coming from the game that we didn't think of like we didn't think of this being a thing it's kind of cool and we don't want to ruin that
