### Transcript

> uh people have spotted these little black things up here uh and we're wondering what these are about um so well when you go in you can kind of get an idea as to what they were because the next shot in the trailer was this here right and some folks didn't really know what they were supposed to see here but uh a keen eye spots these beams running all along the top okay so you can actually build beams uh now so beams are coming so if you want to build those i'll just pull that out there i can take it and i can just freeform build the beams as i want you can just kind of just do them however you want they do snap to things as well like the way these beams were built i think they were like uh something like uh a foundation or something i think the way that sn did this was he built a bunch of foundations he put up a wall and then just built it out like that or something like that and then from this point on you can just connect the beams all right so the the beams the way they work right now they're actually in work in progress i think they're a little finicky to use but we're going to find out we're going to sort of tighten it up between now and when update 5 comes out but beams are pretty cool they're free for them you can do whatever you want with them pretty exciting now these little black parts here that were sticking out the other side are actually beam connectors yeah so these are beam connectors you can just put them on beams if you want i mean you can put them wherever you want really and then you can sort of build a beam out from there to here maybe build a connector connectors are nice to sort of hide the seams you know and also like here when they when they poke out of the wall here you can do that you know use the connectors there i mean there's i mean there's no saving this kind of garbage but you know you can put connectors on the tips make it look a little nicer i mean like i said there's no saving this but yeah the the beams are you know free form and we think a lot of people will have a lot of fun with them and be you know get pretty creative with the beams um of course you can build these power lines up on them at the top here as you can see uh i've also heard sort of suggestions of like putting down like putting conveyors up on top i think kibbits maybe said that maybe too steep and then you could just like run conveyor belts above if you want like i don't know maybe that's a thing maybe that's a thing you can do if you want up to you um yeah so those are the beams they're coming too now we can fly through the
