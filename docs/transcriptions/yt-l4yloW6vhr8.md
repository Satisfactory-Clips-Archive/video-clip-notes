### Transcript

> let's do it is creative mode coming it's uh it's coming at some point maybe i think i don't know i don't know i remember if we promised creative mode i think we talked about it before that we want to do it uh but the thing with prayer mode is that the thing we're kind of dreading if we add creative mode is that people will hit the memory limit in the game uh faster and uh we're kind of scared of that so we kind of want to optimize for that a bit before that we also need to kind of like get feedback on balancing and stuff like that and we feel like if we add creative mode it kind of ruins you know that feedback loop that we we're having right now with everyone on ea um so we kinda like probably at some point but nope i don't know exactly when that's gonna happen and how it would work etc etc etc
