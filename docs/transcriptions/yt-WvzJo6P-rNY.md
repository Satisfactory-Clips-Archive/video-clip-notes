> would you consider allowing players to place a circle foundations in base game rather than use tricks from youtube so like like we said, i said before in update 5 we're going to be making modifications to build mode and i don't actually i think i should know but i don't know, if if that includes like building circles or whatever but i'm not going to reveal anything about it really i don't want to say what the modifications to build modes will be but what we want to do is we want to make, building basically easier for people like we see the things that people want to make and so round things for example is one thing that people have to jump through a thousand hoops to do just to build some round stuff so you know who knows maybe with the new build modes that will make it easier i actually don't know because i've i maybe i just like tuned out on that slide in a presentation or something, but yeah but there are there are other things that we see people want some help with when it comes to building and, we want to make sure that building it's a little easier for you guys so you can build the things that you want to build
