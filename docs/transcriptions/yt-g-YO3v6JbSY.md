> and, it's gonna be update five and the only thing we've talked about in update five, that we've yet revealed is that we're gonna like take a look at our, some of the issues that you guys are having with how you build with the game so like collisioning and stuff like that so the cheeky was kind of an eye-opener for us in terms of what we kind of needed to focus on early on or right now rather because for those who don't know the cheat creed is like this bug that was in the game where some of the foundations in the game didn't have any collision and that opened up like a bunch of possibilities for people to build in a certain way in a little really creative way if you ask me, and, without us realizing we fixed that bug and then we noticed that the community that's you guys, really didn't like that because it cost a bunch of like it made like the some of the building modes in the game feel restricted based on like how collision works in the game and and we we've been aware of some of the issues with collision, from the start you know like how coal generators have like a huge area that you can't build on I don't know if we're gonna solve that thing ex like in particular I really hope we do because I think it's really annoying but, it'd be like a dude that's just because we only use one collision box for question detection in buildings right now maybe we'll add more I don't know what we haven't already, probably something with the systems blah blah blah game development it's tricky

> we kind of realized that when we when we did that that it felt weird not focusing on that like as soon as we can so so that's something that we're focusing update five on a little bit there's always gonna be a lot more than that, in update five but once we have some juicy content to reveal to you guys we will and it's going to be juicy because update five I'm hyped am- I was hyped for update four and I'm all hyped for update five, but in in between then and now we have we have these moments I guess or whatever
