> are there any name change plans for like space giraffe tick penguin welding I don't think we've ever had an official name for those there's a lot of things that have very different things like very different names, internally and externally like liz the dog was a good example, internally we have many names for for liz dargo, like shrimpy we call it the the space rabbit is one name for it we call it, we call it doggo obviously as well and various other names I can't think of right now I don't know I don't even remember what the name of the like the the name of that class even I think that's space rabbit maybe but yeah like space giraffe is the name of the tick and we have the space tick is something we also say internally some community members say beans we also think that's funny so some people say that like this all these creatures have a lot of different names and it goes the same for some of the structures that we have some structures are not called the same way as there are in the game like the the hub is called trading post internally the the the drop pod is not called the draw pod internally which is insanely confusing because we have a d like you know those like hard drive crash things those are internally called heart drop pods and the actual drop pod is called something else confusing as hell it's really confusing I'm just gonna put that out there, but- I don't know if we're gonna rename things in the future especially not since we're doing a little bit more translation stuff now, I can mention this because we're doing community different translations for the game, and before the steam release we we've, we've hired a few professionals to help out with that and help proofread and stuff so they're going to help out and then it's going to be community driven all the way through but, it would mess up some of the translations if we rename things I think so, yes long answer to your short question all right I'm going to take like one or two because I want to move on, just call it a walking haggis oh my god that's disgusting
