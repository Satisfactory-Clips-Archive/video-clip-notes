> how about using batteries in hover pack that's not going to happen, for two reasons the the major reason is because the hover pack is not supposed to be a traversal tool sounds pretty weird saying it like that but the point of the hover pack is to give you an overhead of your factory when you're building it, that's why we have the dependency that you can only use it in close proximity to powered power lines because you're not supposed to be able to use it like wherever you want the jackpack is is what you're supposed to use when you're exploring, so if we were to use batteries instead of you know that limitation that would mean that hover packs would be like the thing to use which we don't want, so that's that's the main reason the second reason of that is because we don't want to I don't remember if I had two reasons but that's that's like the main reason why I think I baked it into two like the the two reasons are oh the main reason is that hover packs are not supposed to be used for exploration, anyway however pack works fine if you bring supplies for powerballs yes we're okay with that actually we don't mind that but that's such a hassle that like it's it's like way easier to use use the jet pack so like if people you know want to use bring power poles and stuff like go go for it okay like it's it's 100 slower than just using with jetpacks but if you want to do it hey should do it up to you
