> somebody asked about deck support as well if you show me your dad couch anyway, sorry I'm assuming you're talking about the steam deck, we have shown off that it runs on a steam deck, yeah but that doesn't that doesn't mean much it doesn't you know like no yeah we haven't seen it we haven't, we have a steam deck at the office and we have tried the game on it and it works and like it doesn't run amazingly unlike you know bigger save files but it runs you know so, maybe in the future we'll we'll optimize a little bit for it maybe but we you know probably won't do that until we finish optimizing the the game for pc fully but it works right as of speaking or like a time of writing it works on the steam deck but whether we like officially just support it or whatever like that's that's up there that's an interpretation yeah there's a big difference there yeah
