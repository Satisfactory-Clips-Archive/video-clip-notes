> much more reliable now even though it's more reliable it's still possible that your vehicles will get stuck okay so they might get stuck on like a tree or something out in the wild uh or they might you know be bumping on like a power pole or something like that within your factory and so what we've also done is we've sort of uh improved the handling of obstacles so what the vehicles will now do is that if they bump into things they'll sort of back up and find like a new path around the object that they've bumped into and try and go around that and and then return back to the recorded path so they're a little bit smarter when it comes to this this isn't like a catch-all thing you can't build a wall in the way it doesn't regenerate an entire new path it is a very sort of naive thing so it is still possible that even though the obstacle avoidance is a little bit better now or the obscure handling rather is a little bit better now uh it is still possible that things get stuck so what happens in those cases if your vehicle is well and truly stuck like what if it falls off the edge of a cliff like like this vehicle here did fell off the edge of a cliff so we have a new system in place for this as well this is the worst case scenario lost resort solution and that is little tiny nano machines lift your vehicle through the ground back to where they were supposed to be i mean we call this like ghosting the vehicle ghosts back to where it was this is a little weird it's completely fine right fix it developed technology it's it's fine okay it's fine don't worry about it but what's more important here is that vehicles are reliable right so when you record a path and you want a vehicle to do something and then you go and play the game for another three or four hours doing something else and you check on your vehicles what's most important right now is that your vehicles do make it okay and and that the goods are delivered right so that's what we're you know this is the the the worst case scenario here we would prefer this sort of like ghosting system uh to vehicles getting stranded out in the wild and i think i think you guys as players would would appreciate that as well so uh yeah that's another change that's coming too another issue of unreliability with the
