> everyone my name is Jace I'm a community manager here at coffee stain studios I'm in my apartment not a coffee stain studios but I work so today we're going to be doing a big old Q&amp;A video and this is gonna be a big one I asked for questions on like all the socials and we took a bunch of them I didn't want to cut any of them out essentially so this is gonna be kind of long I think we got like 38 things to answer here okay so let's begin all right so we've got this person here yes I've been playing on this one epic since ages love the game so much cool thank you the question are there any plans for any sort of flying vehicle even if it's just some kind of hang glider where you could fly around you know a huge request and suggestion from I guess hand gliders to drones the answer is no we don't have plants for that and I think we essentially don't necessarily think it fits and again this is one of those things where we think that there are other ways to solve issues that people are having that flying vehicles could maybe also solve except that flying vehicles are cool if we're the only way to solve that what is different flying vehicles in but at this stage the answer is no essentially so this was an interesting question III don't think I've ever had this question before but it has kind of come up in other ways they've asked just out of curiosity but with dedicated servers break the game not as in the game crashing or anything like that but what they're asking essentially is the point of the game is to optimize the speed of your factory but if you have a dedicated server you can just let things run 24/7 you wake up the next morning and you've got that the resources that you need regardless of efficiency this kind of thing has been discussed before because the game even if you don't have dedicated servers you can just do that anyway and we've kind of just been okay with people doing that one of the reasons is because yes the point is efficiency but if the way you want to play the game is to just let it run that's fine the other thing is a massive amassing large stockpiles of specific resources you know will get you somewhere but it's not really the point of the game and it's not really gonna push you forward that much like you're still gonna run into new things that you need to make and then you're gonna have to go make them anyway so it doesn't push you forward as much as it may seem that it would stop piling things that is yeah really good question I think are we planning to release a Linux and Mac version another question that pops up all the time and and along with this consoles as well basically other platforms so that other people can play currently there is no plan I think we want to but there is no plan as in yeah we're gonna do it and we're gonna do it you know by this time there's no actual plan the the belief right now is we just want to stick to Windows to try and get the game done and by done I mean also the design of the game it's a hard game to finish to make sure balancing is right to make sure the right features are in and if we were to throw other platforms in that would just throw a wrench in the work it would be harder to continue developing we're gonna be running into issues that are platforms specific we're probably gonna run into build issues like even though Unreal Engine just works for all the platforms nothing just works from the platforms and so that's just gonna take time away from completing the game but of course it would be great like I mean why would we not want to get it on those platforms right like I don't know I assume that we would I don't know I get the feeling that's gonna happen this is just me speaking here and not coffee-stained so like I don't know the actual decision there but I'm pretty confident that what I'm saying is shared by the others will the steam version run game run on Linux either native or with proton not native whether it runs with ports on or not I don't know I we haven't put any time or effort or looked into it so I don't probably not see another good question what does one point it looked like reading a little bit of an answer here from our director the answer is we don't really know like satisfactory but finish but no I mean there's a lot more that he's written here and you know we have somewhat of a crude plan he says here for a minimum viable product you know we will have at least eight tiers so maybe more than eight tiers more than eight tiers confirmed I didn't know that improved exploration content for the mercis fears summer sleep and Sam of course the story will be in there as well yeah game customization like game modes like passive or creative so that's I assume confirmed then I didn't know if that was confirmed or not but I was confident it was coming and more awesome shop stuff so that's the kind of stuff that's the minimum that we want to do he says so I guess it's gonna be you know we may want to do more than that Bernie Sanders says I'm once again asking for official mod support so yeah again we have confirmed official mod support we will be doing it in syndicated service of taking forever to do but we're gonna be doing it yeah I just don't know when yet will it be steam cards and achievements also do you intend to use the Steam Workshop in any way everyone its Jase from the future here my previous explanation of the achievement thing is a little bit garbage so I'm gonna redo it basically we're not gonna be doing achievements anytime soon and the main reason is because the game isn't completely stable yet in design or balance and so achievements don't really make much sense they're they're hard to gear achievements to a specific goal when in six months from now all of that could become irrelevant so we want to wait until the game is in a better state a more stable state so that we could start crafting good achievements for the game as opposed to just rushing some stuff in that we're gonna have to delete later or whatever so yeah stay tuned for achievements at some point in the future back to you pasta Jase bye so do we intend to use the Steam Workshop in any way we have to wait until with the amount support for that and then we'll figure it out it makes some sense it also doesn't in some ways in that we're gonna have people in other platforms like epic potentially others who knows who may not have workshop to work with but maybe we also put workshop right because it's it's nice for those who are in steam we'll see I will to be a sale when it first releases on Steam completely unimportant will there be weather changes would look cool to have like a roof of your head I guess when rains hitting it or whatever maybe in some effects on machines it's really unimportant it's a good question and I also asked the director about this and we do want it because it would be great to have it's just it's one of those things that depends on priority so what they're saying here is maybe a yes but don't know when definitely a cool idea that I've bought a copy on epic game store I was wondering it when the the game can't read the game releases on Steam don't get a like a free steam key no you do not okay so this question here I'm not gonna read the whole thing but in summary ya multiplayer is working but it has quality of life issues are we gonna fix them are we prioritizing those multiplayer issues at all yeah yeah the answer is yeah of course we're always fixing it like constantly fixing multiplayer issues as we know or as you may know we are making dedicated servers it's taking us quite a time but one of the main issues with dedicated servers are these multiplayer issues like another thing to consider here is you know usually performances were so client you've got to know that with dedicated servers everyone is the client the host is the server so all of these client issues that you're seeing will happen on the dedicated servers as well now of course that a dedicated server may run faster and you know fix some issues or mitigate a lot of that stuff but we still need to fix the issues right so yeah we're working on so why did you sign an exclusivity deal with epic wasn't for the money understandable especially if the amount was large enough or were there personal reasons no slander or hate but I just wanted to hear the reasoning from dev thank you for not slandering or hating yeah so we answered this question way back when we became exclusive with epic but it that's been some time so I'll just I'll just rehash it real quick of course there was the money aspect I'll talk about that lost I want to say a few things first and that is that there were a lot of other things that we sort of supported with that move you know from the support for content creators um the revenue share obviously the standard at the moment is like 30% revenue share of your money just goes to the platform and it's fair that the platform takes money you know sistema steam does the 30% thing but 30% is a lot of money and so epic has been offering 12% and that is much much better and and so that we wanted to support that movement for potentially better revenue share within the industry as a whole as developers we also think of the well-being of developers and we think it's important that developers make money like that they that they get a better share from from what they're doing so so we think that's pretty good as well now you know we now I say that but now we're going to steam right so are we going back on it I don't know maybe right but but the the other reason really was you guys as well like like we heard you guys like so many people wanted steam and we wanted to do right by a lot of folks we really did think of you guys and you know this is not me just like spouting some to make you feel important like it really was I remember the conversations you know III was there like I was part of it and you guys were important in that decision very important in that decision so I just wanted you know said thanks for that and we sort of also think about you guys as well for why we went to steam now the last thing is obviously money yeah of course there's that now the the reason and you know again this is one of those things that people will say he's the PR guy don't believe but the fact of the matter is when it comes to the money it's scary releasing this it was scary released in this game you know we spent years working on this and it's a factory game you don't know if your factory game is gonna recoup three years of money let alone make any kind of reasonable profit to keep us going for like longer right we don't we we have we had no guarantee we didn't know we you know we knew the game was good but you just don't know if that's gonna take off and we did so I guess in hindsight maybe we didn't need it but we don't regret it because we still don't mind being on the epic store it it really is about security and it's it's that's why there are a lot of devs who are people going there I I think it's not just me it's not just money in the pocket like I can assure you that it's not just we want to make more money I can assure you that it's more likely security you know is a studio gonna be open can we keep paying rent you know that is a huge part in it remember that world humans as well especially when it comes to management you know how manages and stuff like that they're really awesome and you got to remember that their priority is is to ensure all the people in the company have a job you know they're gonna take care of us and and you know so they're they're doing that I I can assure you it's not about it's not about just getting rich I can I can assure you but people would believe that I understand that too a more lighthearted thing please tell us the story about your biggest night out together as developers I hope it involves alcohol and high jinks we've had many many outings I can't really remember the biggest night out I guess we've had big things like the goat simulator party where there was like a lot of studios and people within have that came and hung out that was you know pretty big and in fact okay yeah so we'll stick with that one that was a big party here is the hijinks the next morning so at our studio where we were before if you walked out the front door there were stairs going down into the basement below and at the bottom of those stairs there was human with toilet paper so someone at the party got toilet paper and took a in the basement I don't know how that worked we still don't know who the mystery poop person was if anyone has any information please call 1-800 mystery poop man and that will help us get to the bottom of this but we get more than one body maybe have them unlocked in the ma'am I think everyone be happy about that yeah this is requested bajillion times a day a lot of people will sort of want this we discussed this on the stream recently but obviously not everyone here in YouTube is at the stream consider checking out the stream twitch.tv/esa in studios Debs every Tuesday so we got some information from the director here the gist of what of why we don't have them yet is well first of all we want them they would be cool but it would be the game is not balanced for that right now when it comes to duration but exploration is also underdeveloped so we kind of want to we just need to take exploration just a little further and then figure out what we're gonna do with like extra body slots in the finished game will the story of the game impact how you play or will satisfactory always stay purely sandbox we want the story to be a little bit more of a backseat or or maybe something that people can explore if they want to the priority of the game right is for you to build a factory and you know efficiency and all that kind of stuff I think it would be a bit crappy if like tier six is blocked unless you do the story stuff you know when some people just you're there on the fifth plate throw satisfactory and they just want to get through the game when is the Sam or gonna be useful in the game all right so we got some cool information here for you when will become useful dono so it won't be for a while now Sam is supposed to be tied to the story in some way and the story is not something we want to push until like 1.0 or just before 1.0 or something like that however we're still seeing if Sam content can be pushed independently of the story and in that case it can come sooner but yeah we just don't know at the moment but what we can say Sam or will likely be a ma'am resource and that is consent will mostly be used by players nearing the end of the game to solve problems around their factories they might not want to deal with as much at that point so that's kind of interesting huh I didn't know that either I learned a lot from my director do you plan on introducing more ways of transportation trucks trains or updating the current versions of vehicles it's gonna be a new vehicle in into year seven or eight as for upgrading vehicles we're considering it but we don't know yet as for updating vehicles or vehicle functionality there's gonna be updates there while lights are not currently in the game would it be possible to add an option for it to always be daytime that time can be very annoying inside quote in closed factories very common issue that people are running into I mean everyone's asking for lights and so rubber Ducky's dog has offered a solution here so spoke to the director about this one as well he said Hannah would be sad since she's put a lot of time into the world at nighttime as well and making those transitions good but yeah we understand the issues there would not be able to see with your factory and this goes back to the disclaimer thing that I was talking about in the beginning we may find a solution for this and this day time is is one potential solution but but I think we're gonna be looking for a better solution for this issue and what that is when it comes and you know what it'll look like we don't really know just yet yeah we know it's an issue for you guys we know so uh essentially will there be new buildings added to the game there will be obviously new buildings in tier 8 when that comes and more things gonna be added to tier 7 as well so there'll be new buildings in tier 7 and another cool thing here is he said that we're looking at additional logistics and manpower management solutions no promises but suggestions are always welcome so suggest the way and in fact suggest on our QA side questions dot satisfactory game.com there is a suggestion category and mark the director he reads that religiously so go there and post your suggestions for logistics power management and anything else you have suggestions for also leave bug reports there is there gonna be any third person toggle and/or customization for our character planned the third person toggle is something that you know we kinda have that support we used to have that support we kind of have it in the vehicles right however it actually causes a lot of issues like design issues if you have third person and that will require time and resources to solve and right now we don't feel we want to allocate time to solving third person design issues right now and maybe check the cool ones if they're out there as well customization of our character I don't know but I think it's gonna be a matter of prioritization at this point didn't you quit yes you have any rough expectation when the full release of the game will be 20 20 21 or 22 not 20 20 could be 21 it may be 22 you know since we since we also don't know how much work is ahead of us it's kind of hard to predict will we ever be able to leave the planet that it might be a great idea to mine an asteroid for high tech materials tier 8 plus maybe definitely sounds fun definitely sounds like we're not doing it sounds like a nightmare any chance of a holster key bind yeah this is something that people have been upset about for a long time right rightfully so I get it I don't know though I don't know what I forgot to actually ask

> what is one item or equipment that some of the staff have wanted but got can't for balance reasons or because it just didn't make the cut so one thing so one thing that comes to mind is like factory defense based defense creatures attacking a factory and destroying it any turrets and stuff we had we had that idea a lot of people even suggested that but we have chosen not to do it we don't like the idea anymore and we don't want to do it so we have removed that and we're not gonna do might we see more megafauna doing desert is missing something I don't know there's gonna be something in to do does it but we are gonna have a big crab a big angry crab if you watch our reveal trailer there's a big crab in it that hasn't been added into the game yet and also in Christopher animators develop a highlight maybe I'll remember to do this he you can see the animation of the big crab that you know he was working on and he plans to introduce a less destructive power generation before a cold so I guess green energy right yeah I mean this is something again a conversation that is continuing I've talked about this a few times there there's there's two aspects to it right the first one is lore wise it doesn't make much sense you know fix it Inc don't care about this planet why would they need green energy they want you to cut everything down take the or send it back and then we'll leave maybe we'll move to another one I don't know if that's canon or not you know so like they don't care about green energy or being less destructive however it would be fun to do I love you that's not a question what did Simon really say about the sloops okay so something happened in the audio it was in the video with Simon VFX with Simon yeah there was something weird with the audio I missed that sorry so what he was saying about the slopes right is I like it and no because I don't maybe you will and maybe that's something that you would like but that's pretty much yeah that's pretty much it I think will it be a farming system with seeds and stuff so we can plant our own fruits that's something that's in talks so maybe like we there's another thing that we've been doing that we've been discussing so we'll see if that goes what are your thoughts regarding replayability and then they go on to offer some suggestions on what we could do for replayability I asked direct for man about it and randomization of resource nodes has been discussed but there's no promises on that he thinks that we should have this but does know that there might be some technical complement complications or how much effort it will take so we'll see how it works again this is one of those things where we we have this suggestion here we hear that people want it and we may have to find a solution that addresses you guys things addresses the way that the game should work and what is feasible in terms of effort and resources safe to say that will deliver some features of this this person says something about tasty metal don't know what you're on my friend but in a fart and glorious future what we have other maps he'll know I mean in a far and glorious future maybe in a far and glorious future is proper rail signalling in the works for the future the consensus here is that there probably will be don't know when it looks like it's gonna happen lights when I can't see you around my base at night ok so I kind of talked about this before you know with the whole the suggestion of like the daytime so that you can see at nighttime yeah and so I'm pretty sure we're gonna have lights the issue with lights is that they are hard to make and it sounds like that's weird because you know you could jump into Unreal Engine drag a dynamic light into the world and you're like but I'm made of light yeah we can put a light in the game the issue is performance and and when people can build lights wherever they want however many they want this is something that is going to tank the game quite quickly so we need to find some nice way to figure it out like another example is the the glass foundations and walls that we have now that is hard to drawing transparent things is expensive performance-wise but we found a good solution for it and now we can have it so we have to do something similar with the lights find some sort of good workaround to make sure it's it won't destroy the game alrighty so that's all the questions that I am answering today I think we were able to confirm and even reveal some interesting stuff here it's been a while since I've done a Q&amp;A video so hopefully this was fun oh I hope it isn't too long for you guys let me know what you think about longer videos like this because I think it was still you know a lot information still in it and I'm not helping making it shorter right now so let's and the V if you liked the video hit like smash the subscribe button and you could follow us on social media as you can see all that stuff in the description below I thank you very much for hanging out and I will catch you next time stream on Tuesday twitch.tv slash coffee stain studios devs bye
