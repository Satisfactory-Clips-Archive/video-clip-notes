### Transcript

> I had a save game from early access I tested the unreal engine up, engine upgrade in experimental for five hours or so it came back to my early access and my save is not working, yeah that's because you, the saves don't the sales are backwards compatible basically yeah the saves right that's the issue yeah they are backwards compatible but they're not forwards compatible so if you play it on a newer version and try to load them from an older version like oh yeah backwards that doesn't work so that's why I urge everyone to always back up their saves because if you want to go back to early access again then it's because the the save files the new save files, expect the game to be as it is in experimental which is a newer version and, the old early access version of the game doesn't know what the future version of the game is going to be exactly finally a big mac tattoo yes it's like also in this specific case like there's, the way the engine saves the data is different for like text and something with like object stuff so in this version we have to change how we save stuff and there's no way the old version can know that like there's no way we can back go back in time and realize that you know unless we intended and then we'll jump into a reverse machine and then we'll invert ourselves and go back and write code backwards my mind is blown
