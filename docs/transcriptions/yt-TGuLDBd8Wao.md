### Transcript

> um are you guys going to increase the build limit now that we can place more items so the build limit is not something that we have set like we haven't like chosen a build limit for some reason uh to limit folks like that's actually a limit that's kind of imposed uh by the engine itself and it is possible to change that via config files but that will result in sort of like uh we can't guarantee any stability when it comes to that kind of stuff so we're not when if we could just change the build limit there'd be no no issue then yeah of course we just changed the build limit like why not uh but yeah that's not how that works unfortunately unfortunately and um yeah that's that's a good summary of that
