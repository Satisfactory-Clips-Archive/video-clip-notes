> on the qa site does a post have to have x hundreds of uh votes to be implemented or can it have like 30 uploads to be implemented it can have it doesn't the number of votes doesn't actually mean it will be added um unless it's golf unless yeah so golf is a special case in this case um but number of votes is is just uh a a factor in the decision making process you know when we see if we see something is highly highly requested but you know if it's something that we don't want to add into the game we're not going to add it you know tower defense could be top voted we're still not going to add it because it's like that's just not something we want to add to the game um but it does get some visibility it is something that we'll see oh okay a lot of people do want this and that's something we can factor in when we start considering the other things that we need to weigh into that decision making process um but you know there are things that are you know that can have it could have one vote it doesn't really matter if it's a good idea um it's a good idea so true story
