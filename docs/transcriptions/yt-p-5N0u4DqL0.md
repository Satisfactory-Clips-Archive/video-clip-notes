### Transcript

> and now we are all all those other people are here we're gonna talk about vacation we're gonna talk about the vacation that's coming up oh boy where's the button there's the button, yeah it's gonna be maybe today it might be a little shorter because there's not too much there's not too much new to talk about there's not much happening at the studio right now because everyone well most people are on vacation that's just a bunch of nerds left I will tell you that the spitter bug that's happening on experimental right now we're still investigating that we are looking into the cause of it it's actually a couple of different issues it seems it doesn't seem like it's the same like cause for the crash it seems like we fixed one like edge case of the crash but there's a couple of more

> so we're still working on that and we hope to patch it this week hopefully fingers crossed if we can solve it before then

> but real quick real quick recap if you didn't I put out a video last week you can check that video out if you want it's on our little youtube, oh I just realized I forgot to make a a thread on the discord ah one second there we go, oh god I forgot oh no oh so many oh no, I can't rename it whatever, it's it's the last dream I'm tired, good times will be ahead by all yeah I forgot I was streaming again, what was I talking about yeah I put out a video last week, essentially just giving the state of things as they are while we go into vacation like the last couple of information like the last information if you will, and and, yeah that that information is still is still going, yeah dude you need a vacation you're telling me

> like the whole studio is essentially on vacation right now it's just me and a couple of more and, we're still working on like the most major crash issues with which is right now the the crash with the spitter, and hopefully we we can solve that before to before like you know if we're too late, it's not like we haven't stopped completely working on the game there's still a couple of people left in the studio but, yeah so so but that that's like the most that's like the only thing we're really working on right now that we are intending to to push, so, don't expect like any anything major really if if we make a patch, and, yeah like we won't be back, from vacation until sometime mid august or something like that so if you're wondering when will we see update six on early access it will probably take some time because we we released experimental before it was fully finished we released it before our vacation period which also means that we get this like awkward like one and a two months of sort of delay because we're not working we're on vacation so, but honestly I think, I think one thing people forget when they're asking and thinking that this is a weird decision is that you are all going to get update 6 earlier I guess it's a little bit more of a tease because like it is there an experimental first for the people who are brave enough to try it out but for the people that don't want to like want to play on the stable version it feels like you're waiting for a longer period of time but it's actually not true because it's the other way around because the other way we could have done this is not update the game to update 6 until we were all coming back from vacation you know update 6 has been out for like, a couple of weeks how many weeks when we release it 14th I think it's almost a month now exactly so I mean it's been out for for almost a month now and people have been able to try it out and and you know there's a couple of really cool features in there that- I'm super stoked about personally that makes it hard for me to want to play on the stable version even though you know it is a little bit buggy, I definitely see the issue on dedicated servers because that's that's sort of where the the biggest problems are right now, but like yeah so people like mental get access to the game earlier and you know once we get back on vacation we won't need as much time you know once we're back to wrap up sort of the the remaining issues well I say that but there's also a couple of things that aren't done in the update too I mean the ai stuff I guess, so so yeah but you will still get access to it sort of earlier in in the long run it also makes sense more for our like general planning because if we delay then we've got this awkward time of like we could have you know it's very valuable for us to have it in experimental and have it on so people can can give us feedback and stuff like that for development so for us they've also been you know us working on stuff until we can get back to the nitty-gritty which is update six foreign stuff, so, we really think it's it's better to do it this way at least for this update since it's a minor update, which is also important to remember this is a minor update it's not same size as the previous ones apart from maybe update one and two those are also minor updates but so, that's the state of things that's the state of vacation, like I said dedicated servers still have issues and the the best course of action right now is to roll back to the early access version of dedicated servers if you're running into issues there's many issues with like foliage not being able to pick up in certain areas and like some of the fracking nodes don't work properly on dedicated servers, those we won't be able to solve those for a while actually actually because it's more effort for us to troubleshoot dedicated servers, so just bear that in mind but also like dedicated servers are experimental by themselves so you're playing an experimental version of game on an experimental version of dedicated servers so it's like it's like a cake on cake kind of deal

> so yes minor updates oh you guys so funny always there, is there anything else I want to talk about should I talk is there anything I should be talking about chat I feel like, you know there isn't really much going on at the moment so there's not too much to talk about no bye twitchcon I guess we yeah twitchcon is happening this week where me and jace are going to torchcon we have a pretty, if you if you are going to twitchcon as well and you're wondering like or if you're in the in amsterdam and and, we're planning to do a kind of like satisfactory meetup where which is doesn't have to be like tied to the venue so we'll probably do that in some public place or something like that, we haven't really planned too much because I've been busy with a lot of stuff, and, jace just doesn't care no but we're taking it kind of like kind of casual and like just play it by ear a little bit, check out our twitter and instagram instagram instagram instagram if you want news, we'll let you guys know we're right now we're thinking of doing like something on the saturday we'll do some kind of meetup with people, somewhere, maybe outside the venue or somewhere else we'll see so, and if you are in if you're attending twitchcon then we'll probably run into each other at some point, so, so yeah looking forward to that unless the there's like plane issues or something like that you never know because there's a lot of people traveling right now but you know hopefully everything goes well, and, yeah looking forward to it it's gonna be fun it's gonna be really fun there's a lot of cool people coming, you know chat I'm gonna be I'm gonna be honest I have a feeling it's gonna be a short stream not gonna lie but let's let's, let's do a couple of, voice changes disturbing oh wait did something happen with the thing is this thing working no it's working all right, isn't it always true successful long string confirm fair enough
