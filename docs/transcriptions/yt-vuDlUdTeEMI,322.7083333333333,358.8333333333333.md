> of multiplayer bugs specifically there's also a very known multiplayer bug where foliage will not like disappear on clients sometimes now this is an issue that's been in the game since launch and sometimes it just like escalates during launches because something when we change make big changes it just appears again for some people the reason why that hasn't been fixed up until now is because the the fix for that is having to remake a big system when it comes to the foliage um and that's something that we haven't been able to dive into but we are going to be able to do that very soon so i hope in the next couple of updates maybe we'll be able to fix that i don't know fingers crossed
