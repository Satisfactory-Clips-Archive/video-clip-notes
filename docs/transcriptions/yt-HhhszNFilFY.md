### Transcript

> Dallas coming not at the moment we have looked into it but it's like it's it's a weird it's a weird it's DLS is weird for us we don't really see the huge benefit for it most of them like there's some improvement for people that have those kind of graphics card but like if you have a car that supports the LSS you're not gonna you probably won't want to use it you know, because there's only like such a small subset of people that have cards that are supported and those cards are already pretty good, so what's the point it makes sense for like Ray tracing stuff because Ray tracing is still much more like has a higher requirement than than what good graphics card have right now but we don't have support for any of that in our game and also it doesn't like the way we've made a lot of stuff in our game it doesn't support the way dlss works so we would have to do a bunch of stuff, so yeah
