### Transcript

> it's bits asks later down the line would you rather have a second map or a map editor for people to create definitely map editor unless that second map is somehow, procedural because I ain't gonna do this again hell no this is so much work this map is crazy large and, a sec like creating a second map I don't think is gonna be worth it at all for for for any of us, so I'd rather give those tools to the community if they want to see something specific or create something really basic procedurally where for creative mode or something like that right because like it's just not sustainable to make a map like this again time wise investment wise yeah yeah I guess there's some issues with like since we bake the map it's like hard to make changes to it modding-wise, but maybe maybe we can think of something in the future yeah maybe, who knows because I've seen that some because I've seen some people make like maps from scratch you can do that and load into yeah I mean I think there's like some fairly simple stuff we can do, that that is less about like environmental challenges are more like giving people a sandbox right so maybe maybe something that like that is something that we could do but that's a whole other discussion too yeah moon map yeah exactly just like oh it's just rocks easy is it though it's just no poly it's just like ah you know those old I don't know if if anyone's here here has played the like the first mass effect like those like terrain generation that they did for like the side quest planets like just that just like, texture some spikes and that's it like
