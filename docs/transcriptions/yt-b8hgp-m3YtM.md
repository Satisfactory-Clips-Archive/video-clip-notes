> switch to Unreal Engine 5. do you think it's worth for the better game I think I we hope we can switch on Mill engine 5., we've been looking at this extensively for a long time actually, and, like when we have a chance in between things we've been trying to NAB like see if we can do it but it's a lot of work and it's like a lot of stuff that we need to change because like usually when we do okay usually when we upgrade the engine it's usually like oh we need to merge in like the changes we made to on real engine because we made a bunch of custom changes to the engine, and sometimes it's just like we need to update to like the new way they're doing it but the switch from our anal engine four and five is a little bit more drastic, for instance they've completely deprecated the physics engine that existed in running engine 4 and they made their own, and to my understanding that the ufx engine is pretty good but it's like a little bit like still young, so so we would need to like rewrite all the handling of physics which means like all the vehicles would need to be handled in in chaos which is the name of the physics engine in a real engine 5., and stuff like that so we see a lot of benefits in switching to Unreal Engine 5 but there's also a lot of work and, it's always like a question of like we also have like our you know time time table of things we want to get ready yeah and and also I think, you know a lot of people like people I'm mentioning sort of like Illumina nanites and things like that like just because the engine has those I don't I don't necessarily know we we just get that for free yeah exactly if we switch to the end like I think you need to work with those exactly you choose to actually get the benefit doesn't mean we won't get other benefits but yeah for sure and it might still be the case that we do utilize them in some way maybe but then we have to add it into the game you know like it's not like we just get it automatically like just said there, but maybe we want to do that like maybe we want to spend time on doing that but that also means that we need to prioritize you know instead of making, something else we add you know better Global elimination, so it's it's always like a constant prioritization like a question of prioritization do we add the new water, waterfalls and water like things that we've been teasing or do we fix the, like the rendering for unrelated five like it's always like this million things going at the same time, but it would be cool I think it would be there's a lot of benefits to it as well so we we haven't given up on it
