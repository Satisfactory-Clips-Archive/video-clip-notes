> hi everyone my name is Newt I'm one of the community managers here at Causton studios and I just want to give a quick update on what's going on with the steam release because we said this week that we'd be giving more of an update on what's going on and I'm here today to say that we don't know what's going on so I'll see myself out and have a great weekend so we were really hoping that we would be able to give you all an announcement today on what the release date for a steam release would be unfortunately we can't really do that just yet we've said in the past that we've been shooting for late of May and that's still possible however there are still a few unknowns for us and internally we've been kind of trying to shoot for the 20th 6th of May but the way it looks right now it kind of looks like we need to push that back a week or so so we'd be releasing in the thirty third of May so we're still not breaking any promises but even if we push it back one more week we don't know for sure whether or not we're gonna be able to commit to that so we can't announce anything just yet oh yeah these are dates that we're hoping for but we don't know yet hoping for no we really are in that final push right now where things are kind of coming together there's still a few things that we don't know for sure and there's a lot of things that we have to test and verify that it works so I'm once again asking you for your patience in these trying times we're still hoping for the dates mentioned might need to delay don't know for sure yet we're still hoping for things but uh and I know it's frustrating that we keep bouncing back and forth like this and that we can't give a definite answer just yet but just bear with us we really want to get the game up as fast as possible that's kind of why it'd be like this but yeah there'll be more information in the coming weeks we'll see each other soon enough so take everybody have a nice weekend and goodbye
