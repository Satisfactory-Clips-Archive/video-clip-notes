> so many people have crashes issues so far i think more people don't i think a lot more people don't have crash issues but if you have crashes just go to the qa site and report them there questions on satisfactorygame.com if you have any crash issues that are related to like directx directx 12 d3d whatever any kind of like gpu kind of related thing make sure you update your drivers, that that solves it for so many people like if everyone could just try that before ever contacting us that would be great because it helps so many people the next best thing to do if you have those crashes is that it could be that your hardware would work better with directx 11 or maybe director x12 or maybe vulcan and so you can force those using command lines, i can maybe get you a up i might just put a link in the chat here for a video where i explain that time stamped and everything okay very nice here look launch options to change renderer okay that's the next thing you can try if you're having crashes with gpu and then and but probably the most important thing you should try is check to make sure that you actually have hardware that is supported check out minimum specifications because if you are outside of that we cannot guarantee that the game will run yes you can also reset your shader cache, verify installation verify installation on your drivers which is depends on your driver of the game yeah yeah and then verify the game files too if if you didn't say that i think you did that that's what i meant by verify but yeah you can verify your graphics drivers and you can end the game so do you know those are the things that like you know when we get folks contact us we go through those things with them and like 80 of the time their issues are solved from that kind of stuff so it's usually that so switch off and on again and also disable mods if you have mods enable and you're getting crashes it might be because of that too yeah we can't really provide help for mods unfortunately no because there's a lot of there's a lot of mods there's a lot of thing we don't know what they're doing with the mods either
