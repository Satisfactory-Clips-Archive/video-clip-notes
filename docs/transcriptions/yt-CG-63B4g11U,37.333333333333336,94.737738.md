> hey my name is Jace I'm a community manager here at coffee stain studios today we're gonna be talking about some new visual upgrades that are gonna be coming to the game in the steam release version we're gonna be talking to Tosh then our art director here about you know like who he is what is our direction we're also going to talk about obviously and showcase a few of the things like some concept art of the the upgrades that we're gonna be having and why they are the way that they are I think it's gonna be really interesting I say I think it will be I've already done the interview so I know it's interesting I think I think you'll love it I really do think I think that but as you've read in the title there's also a new feature multiple Hutt bars so I'll just get that out the way now okay so these are the multiple Hopf bars if they function just like they did before but you can see on the side there it says the number one it goes to ten you can see on the little circle where it highlights on which hot bar you're on and yeah they just function as regular hot bars too of course you can have like different sets now one could be an exploration hot bar ones like a foundation hot bar one could be pipes one can be conveyors and and buildings whatever power and I'm sure you're gonna figure out good ways to use it now the cool thing about that is the stuff we're gonna talk to Torsten about is gonna be stuff that's gonna come in to the steam release but this is actually coming next week we've already got it done it's gonna be in the experimental version next week and so test that I hope it doesn't break don't find bugs please you'll find none we'll release it sooner okay so let's head over to touch them now and yeah let's let's did you check it out hello everyone this is actually round 2 of recording this because I forgot to hit record I've done this mistake before but anyway we're here join with us then good good yeah good sorry I'm yeah and this is our art director and so today we're gonna talk a little bit about art direction what not and we're also gonna show off some concepts of some reworks that we're going to be doing that will come into the game soon or should or maybe so would you like to introduce yourself yeah Dawson's the name art director at coffee-stained I started at coffee-stained relatively recently I came in in February - lovely Hooft and what can I say I love it it's it's really cool and yeah I really appreciate to be part of this and yeah and now I have the fun to talk about something some art I reckon yeah thanks yeah for sure and and so for those out there who may not know exactly what art direction entails could you give a little bit of like a brief explanation yeah what what it entails essentially in my job apart from actually doing hands-on work like doing concept art - I'm responsible for looking into maintaining like a quality for art assets but also making sure that any new assets or any new visuals that we work on fit into the overall visual identity or the style if you like of the game of the game world and of satisfactory in general and look into a stuff that we might potentially improve even further and maybe even redesign based on like based on just visual quality or requests or yeah whatever we see necessary to improve yeah cool and that is actually a good point there to move on to what we're gonna be showcasing the the idea of just redesigning of I guess like what is there for that purpose okay so we're gonna switch to something now and show you something cool so this here is the new train station it's a concept right yep can you tell us a little bit about it yeah this concept was done by Sophie she did a really good job on what is essentially a polishing design of the existing train station we're not looking so much into changing changing functionality of the train stations but more like tweaking architecture and design and shape language a little bit so that it's it looks a bit more appealing and a bit more sleek and we're getting a kick out of it I think it it's already looking pretty good it's being worked on right now and I'm pretty positive the people will like it once it's in the game yeah looks looks look snazzy man look snazzy that's exactly what we were aimed for it yeah sect awesome and and yeah and just a point here is a lot of folks have features that they want or you know steam release and you know can you just like work on it to get it out or whatever but something to put out here is like the art team is not really the bottleneck here so so there they continue to work on polishing the world and the world is pretty nice and that's because the art team do this kind of stuff to improve the world now it says work in progress it's stamped there and I believe you said that before so it's been a bit iffy showing work-in-progress stuff because we're afraid of promising anything right yeah absolutely I mean it's its concept art which is essentially saying it's a plan that we go for but usually plans get changed a little bit along the way but what at least what I can promise is we're working on it we work working on on the redesign of the train station and this what you see here is all plan to go for and like I said there's gonna be a little bit of tweaks here and there but but because you'll never know and see you how you make it say that's how you make animations fit and everything but yeah it's working progress but this is what we want to go for yeah very cool and and the goal is to have it in the steam release right it's yeah it's still the goal to have it in there yes we for that yeah I'm not gonna promise anything because I'd rather want it to be done well yeah really our coffee stay to play are you I'm not gonna promise you anything hey general I'm jello generally as a person uh I don't want to promise too much I'd rather I'd rather promise too little and then surprise people right but yeah it's definitely what we aim for yes awesome shall we move on yes all righty so we have another one here and it looks like there's gonna be a rework of the man yeah the rework of the man is that the goal is essentially to make the current ma'am give the current ma'am a little bit more a little bit more sciency feel to it adding a little bit of detail and a little bit of interesting depth to it and while keeping the main functionality of course I mean as you can see like the ma'am the MEMS Prime feature and prime function is you throw in stuff and it gets analyzed and the data gets submitted gets sent to fix it for rewards and for new recipes and for new ways to construct things and that's why this is gonna have a lot more iconic parts in there that try to communicate these these exact parts of the these steps for example we have like the AFV analysis which gets get thrown over to the research research data progressing which sends it to the uplink and of course there's a lot a little bit of fluff some like anywhere you have the tinkering desk with a lovely little stuff lying around and some other things and what we also aim for is to visualize information on the ma'am a little bit more so that screens actually show you the the current progress like a progress bar that when you walk or pass the ma'am on your way to I don't know how to buy your coffee cup at the mem awesome shop you could go past there look at and say or whatever it's 50% I can come back later so ideally yeah you get a lot of informations via that yeah I love that sorry my camera died I was distracted but did you talk about the uplink animation yeah part of the one one another plant animation is to have like the the satellite the data uplink also being movement being in motion once it's actually working it's got stuff to do so players can guess or can see at a first glance like Oh at one glance you know okay ma'am is done I could I could just feed it some more weird specimens I picked up all hard drives so yeah cool fancy my camera died I am having a day but that's okay no one needs to see me I'm just gonna put like a stupid picture of me my technology hates us I don't know yeah it has been a thing today but that's okay we can totally just keep continuing it's not a big deal okay so I guess that's it maybe for the man yep yep okay so yeah okay so the next thing is some equipment polish yeah those are smaller changes probably than the others we've teased you about with the train station in the mam the equipment pretty much got a polish to make them all feel more of a set of fixit's of official fix-it tools provided for the pioneers so so that I have the same the same color coding they have the same materials and everything is a bit more coherent visually so we looked into that again we didn't change really change functionality it is more of a visual to tweak and yeah and I think they turned out pretty fine I like them a lot actually because that would now they really look like they're part of the fix-it tool family yeah sure yeah yeah I can see that and for some reason I really like the paint on the end of the tape gun I just love those colors and maybe that's a stupid thing to like but I do I think that's very valid to like fancy colors I yeah I mean half of the good t- the colors if you mess up the colors you can just you can just throw away the rest and you're such a nice guy touched it you just gave it and saved my ass right so I think I think that was all we were gonna showcase today from you and hopefully we can show off more stuff in the future I hope people like this approach of us just we want it we do want to be a little bit more open with the dev dev stuff and keep you all in the loop so you know what to look forward to especially after update
