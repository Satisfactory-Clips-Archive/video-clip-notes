> i will say that five fantasy ten gets too much for what it's worth ten was great yeah i think ten i think the issue was mainly that they had voice acting in that it's too jarring for people or something i don't know uh yeah i mean i didn't think it was like there's it was pretty rough around the edges here and there the voice acting but it's like this is the first time final fantasy had voice acting um and honestly i think overall it was quite good but it's easy to point and laugh at the uh laughing yeah that was a bit cringe but because like one thing that it was also really good though yeah because because one thing i think is really good in fact 12 10 is the racist stuff not that i condone the racist stuff but it it's it's never been like done before i think yeah it's actually actually yeah we're like one of your main characters is a blatant racist throughout the entire races yeah yeah and and it's kind of weird it's like really obvious now but like for some reason well i mean i'll just i guess i can only speak for myself but i feel like back in that at that time when i played it you know i wasn't really aware of this kind of well not as aware as i am now and so when i played it i didn't really think much of it but when i went back and played final fantasy 10 again i was like walk as a race yeah yeah same i was like whoa i didn't remember but he developed the points he develops from that he develops from that right he's not just like a racist to be cool he's like actually there's some development there
