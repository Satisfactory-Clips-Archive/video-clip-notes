> any thoughts about attaching splitters directly to machines such miners i mean i like the idea i don't know why we don't have that, but yeah i'm not sure so say that again what was it i missed the any thoughts of attaching splitters directly to machine slash miners yes i was actually part of a lot of discussion in that regard in the early days this is the early days because i believe we changed our minds a little bit but one of the main reasons was because it wasn't clear enough what happened, when you just attached a splitter to a machine it became like odd to like figure out what was going on there's also like a technical reason, where we need the the the belt sort of and if we wanted to do the thing where you can attach splitters to to factories we would need to like add like additional logic to the splitters and mergers and it made it like pretty ugly, so we just decided not to pursue that it's not impossible that we change our minds in the future and and make it so that you can attach them straight on because i believe there's an exception to conveyor lifts because they are technically a belt you can attach splitters directly on them i believe correct me if i'm wrong, but that's not but that's because it is a conveyor belt and it already has because the problem with with the also with this threading in the game is that when we update the threads in the game they're updated separately so belts are upgraded updated separately and then splitters and then factory buildings which would mean that the order of execution would be like a special case when a factory building could output directly to a splitter so we would like mess up that update order or something i'm not quite sure exactly how what was the issue there but that was one of the reasons too but it's not like an impossible thing to fix at some point but i don't think we are going to spend time on that because it's a lot of it's a lot of time for like maybe a little too little payout sort of so yeah you
