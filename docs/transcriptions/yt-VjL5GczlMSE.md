### Transcript

> let's see i had the texture bug where certain items on the belts use gray and rainbow placeholder textures rather than their actual ones items like the coffee cup and the fixmas items uh so so those in those cases it's because of the the rework we did on how the rendering of convey bell items work um and if you if there are items that we haven't updated the the textures on or like the materials on please upload that on the keyway site the only exception to that is the fixmas stuff i don't know if we're gonna fix that uh until christmas uh that's not high prio because that's not in the game currently um so so that bug is probably gonna exist until christmas if we do another fixmas again this is what i'm guessing
