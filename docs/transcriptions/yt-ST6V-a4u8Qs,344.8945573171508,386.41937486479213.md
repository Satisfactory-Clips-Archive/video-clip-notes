> the power consumption of overclocking is getting a bit of a balance the change is fairly simple but it is certainly worth knowing for those of you out there who like to crunch numbers and get your setups perfectly efficient mathematically we're reducing the exponent of the power requirements in layman's terms this means that overclocking requires less power than before but underclocking saves less power overclocking on power generators has changed too and is now more straightforward power production gains will now be at the same rate as your overclocking so when you overclock to 200 you will now get 200 of your base power production nuclear power plants will also use less water now to accommodate for these changes making fully overclocked nuclear power plants actually viable now
