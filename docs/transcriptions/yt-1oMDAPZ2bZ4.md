> yeah uh when do we get twitch subscribes slash emote options so uh i'm working with team to get some better twitch tv emotes made so that you guys can use those emotes here in this channel and yeah here in this channel uh but we but you'll need the the extension for that as well the chrome extension or browse extension for uh better twitch tv uh that's like you know like cat jam and i'm pretty sure cat gems works i'm pretty sure that works in chat so anyway um and the reason we're gonna do that and we're not gonna get um affiliate or partnership is because that's what's doing his taxes god damn it um sorry he knew he would get me with that um where was i okay uh we're not going with affiliate and subs subscribe or partnership because we don't really want um to deal with the money side of things like it's just gonna be a pain in the ass and the point here is that you know we we do these community events and hang out and be all pals and stuff so that you enjoy the game you get your information of course this kind of thing sometimes turns to sales then we get money through the game that we're making as opposed to um we don't want to like get money from the that we're doing yeah uh it feels weird man it feels weird so we don't want to do we don't want to do that there's there's too much overhead things change once like actual money for the streams gets involved i don't really want to do that so um we'll we'll we'll add some emotes via better twitch tv and then you guys can um yeah you'll be able to use some emotes here it also yeah it also cuts off the ability for us to do multi streams uh live because twitch has this thing where if you're affiliate or partnered you have to have twitch has 24-hour exclusivity uh on your stream so you're not allowed to upload it anywhere else and so we're streaming to steam right now and we have you know a couple hundred people watching on steam right now we see you we see you guys um and we wouldn't be able to do that and in the future if we want to stream to youtube as well if you have a special event that we want you know to be live on youtube as well we wouldn't be able to do that either yeah we tend to save the youtube streams for special times
