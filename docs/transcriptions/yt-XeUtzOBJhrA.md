> will ever be teleportation i don't know we've we've sort of prototyped it at one point but we haven't made a decision just because we prototype things in the game doesn't mean that they actually happen uh which can be a bummer for like the people implementing the things like but like in comparison i've worked on a lot of games that were never released either so i mean sometimes it'd be like that
