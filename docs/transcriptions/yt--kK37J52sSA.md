### Transcript

> will different players have different highlighted markers yes they will another thing okay I kind of hate maybe maybe we won't do this but another thing that will probably make a few people sad is that when you're doing the highlighting thing you can only highlight one thing at a time so I saw some people saying like oh we can use this to like decorate our bases and stuff like that you can do it but only once but each player has a highlighted marker so I guess you could like four people people could come together and highlight, but I don't know if the highlight will reset during each session so I don't know if that will work but maybe we'll take that feedback and be like you know what maybe we should have so people can have more than one highlighted marker if you want that please go to our q site and let us know that's how they work right now at least you can highlight one thing at a time
