### Transcript

> somebody asked if we're planning ray tracing or dlss in the in the future so it's like let's tackle those two separately okay ray tracing, would be cool we like it's it's like technically doable but it's not something that we feel would add anything to the game, so like there's a lot of cool that we want to spend time on making rather than doing ray tracing even though I mean we've talked about right chasing us like oh that could be a cool thing but it's not something that would necessarily add something to the game, dlss though is a little bit different because the lss is usually tied with ray tracing where like oh if you're using gray tracing you can scale up stuff, and that's true but there's also other aspects of dss where you can run the game at a smaller frame sorry resolution and then scale it up and that say actually saves a ton of, like resources for your for rendering and your your gaming general so that's actually something that we're kind of interested in, in the future the problem right now is that that's not supported in the engine version that we have the game in publicly right now so we would need to update the the game, the the engine version, and that's that's a whole another topic for another day retracing it's just it's just a checkbox oh sure it's just a checkbox it's the same thing with the dlss thing it's like it's just a plug-in you just add the plug-in to your sure you just add the plug-in feel so please go ahead another engine upgrade coming guys brace yourself please not again so so it's just like it's it's something that's probably feasible but we don't know exactly when it will happen, but we but the dlss is the whole point of this this thing why I brought this up is because dlss actually is interesting for us ray tracing isn't something that adds something to the game but dlss can actually add a lot to the game for for people that don't have like a good enough machine to be able to run it like the same way that other people are like if you don't have a beast of a computer dlss can actually save some some resources in that regard so it's it's definitely interesting in an optimization point of view
