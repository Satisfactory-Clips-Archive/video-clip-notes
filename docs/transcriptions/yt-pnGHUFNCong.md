> steam deck support would be cool but steam deck supports, requires that we have control of support and we're not 100 sure if we can have control support at this time because there's still because there's still work left to be done on the game so we don't know what else we're going to add in terms of like inputs, and you know if we add input that we can't translate to a controller then what are we gonna what are we gonna do like then you can't use that in the game or you know so, we don't know we'll have like full-on controlled support in the game, we won't we would like to have it but this you know this is a PC first kind of game and we don't want to like skimp out of features just because like what if we have controls over in the future, so that's the main reason there's also some kind of like a resolution issue, like on the steam deck we're not rendering in the full resolution of the steam deck or something like that, that's also something we need to solve and that messes with the scaling how we've made the scaling in our game, so that's also something we have to solve I mean you can play it on Steam deck it's just, you can't do everything I think or like this this like limited some issues I don't know
