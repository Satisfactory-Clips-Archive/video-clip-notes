> so dedicated servers a question that has been asked many times um what's what is what's going on with dedicated servers uh it's it's a two-fold problem there's both the implementation of like making the actual like dedicated server thing of the game you know like being able to run online you know all the time have people connect have it be on a headless server yada yada that's one thing uh the other thing is issues in the game that are tied to client side issues and currently there are we've been working on we've been working on this constantly the client side issues specifically because they are going to be show stoppers if you have a dedicated servers there are a few things that you cannot do as client in the game and these issues keep popping up over and over again i don't know how many times we fixed the train bugs in multiplayer i've fixed like a bunch of them three times already and they're still popping back up again um and rubber banding and like the the optimization of the game yada yada so we're still working on dedicated servers but there there's a lot of like client-side issues that needs to be fixed before we can before it makes sense having a dedicated server um so so that's what we're working on at the moment and we've been working on this for quite some time it's a very complex game in terms of networking um and we're still working on it so we don't really have an ata but as soon as we know i'll let you guys know um so yeah train bugs never heard of it yeah exactly uh but in update four there are a few uh improvements or a few there's actually a lot of improvements networking wise for satisfactory but also some new bugs so but overall like this as jace always says this is a this is not a one solution fix all this is a marathon that we kind of need to run with with the multiplayer issues so like this is something that we can like dive into for a month and then fix it and then roll out like it's something that we're gonna have to work on as we're working on the game so when it makes sense having dedicated service uh and like being able to roll them out that's when we'll do it we won't hesitate to do that and we'll probably roll them out in like a beta version or like something like that once we feel like it's it's it's notable to have it so to speak um so so that's it i got a question what are your plans for the future
