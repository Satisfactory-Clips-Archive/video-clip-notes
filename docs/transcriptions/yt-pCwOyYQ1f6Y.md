### Transcript

> what is blocking you now from releasing update 4 story elements buildings maps, so yeah just some things just aren't done that's all, just a couple more things that, you know it's like when we when we put out an update they're not just random features right like we say okay what is this package going to be what what way are we going to affect the game what is this update going to do for the game and then we figure out what that is and we figure out what that needs, and then and and and then we go through we make all of those little components that are gonna come together to deliver one specific goal one specific major change to the game and so we need all of the little parts to justify the big change this is really vague speaking but that's kind of how it is like we we always think like what's the mission of of the next big update and, and usually if you have a big mission if you want to change the game in a big way you need a lot of different things and it's good when your things rely on each other and rather than just being like 100 random things that have nothing to do with each other it's better if they all interact, so we need all of it done first, but take to give you any specifics i can't really because like i'd just be telling you like well there's this new feature in this one and this one like i can't tell you but there's, most of it is done or not most of it is done, yeah maybe like a lot of it is like pretty much done and then a lot of it is in progress and soon to be done yeah yeah so it's looking pretty good
