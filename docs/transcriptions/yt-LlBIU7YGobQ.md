> do you have any tips for someone who wants to become a game dev, make games it's it's such a weird like tip but it all it's so true like make small games and finish your game, it feels like a cop-out but it's actually so it's it's because, a lot of things that you look for when you like I think I think speaking from like someone who because I have no game development like, , I didn't go to like game dev school or anything like that- I learned most of the stuff that I learned from like general like programming you know I went to like a regular good old engineering school yay, so- I was I kind of learned game dev by the side and like when I when I got my role at my first game dev job it was it was like a like we can teach you I don't know how to finish stuff and like the important factor really was that I knew how to I knew about the production cycle which is like how to finish something, so like even if you're the best at like making you know ai or making you know something specific, the fact that you know how the whole cycle works and you know what's important there really makes a huge difference and and I and- I did go, to a game dev university and even then it's like it's just like it's so clear that like simply attending class is not enough you need to make games on the side with like hook up with your friends, make some games together, it's it's super important to actually do stuff, actually make games, and I think what's really important is like to really just enjoy the process of like learning and doing it yeah because it's like making games is not a thing that or learning how to make games is not a thing that you you do for a while and then you've you've done it it's actually like it's a learning process forever so you will always always always be banging your head against walls trying to figure things out and getting better and then when you finally get into the game industry it doesn't get easier it just gets harder because now people are like demanding more from you and then as you get better at that then you get even more responsibilities you have to do even more you know so it's like it's it's this constant learning experience that doesn't get easier so like I strongly recommend that you like it's good to have like a goal but don't put everything into the goal just like enjoy what you're doing right now with your friends enjoy the task that you're doing like the 3d model or the programming just really really enjoy what you're doing and then do that for a long time and then you'll get you just you'll be better after a while yeah you know and if you're not like a programmer you don't know how to like how to make the program and stuff like that there are a bunch of tools to like just for artists and like really really find that medium like or and own it because like if you're an artist you don't have a program like just learn the few basics on how to like get into I don't know unreal engine or like blueprint or you know something there are tools I can't remember them right now but just like you know maybe don't make a game with like a bunch of features make a game that's like a novel you know or something like that that fits your medium like so but it's super it's also super good to learn a little bit of the other yeah so like and that's what's really cool with unreal engine with blueprints is that you don't necessarily necessarily need to learn to type code but you can start learning programming and like game logic through it through and through tutorials you don't need to be a master at it but if you gain any level of understanding of like programming as an artist I think that's going to help you as an artist and same goes for programming if you if you do any like 3d modeling or some art you don't have to get good at all but if you do any of it, you're going to learn what that process is like and what the other people that you're working with have to do and that's going to help you with your programming because now you understand what they're doing better so you can do better programming, to take that into consideration so it's like it's great yeah and yeah definitely definitely dabble dabble in a little bit of everything but you can specialize in one thing if you want yeah and there there are like visual scripting in unity too so if you're a unity dev you can you can kind of do the same thing but yeah that's that's such a such a good point cause like I think all programmers like obviously know like how 3d models work and like how to make them and stuff like that so and the same goes for everyone really, so it's good to dabble in everything and like just get an understanding of like how everything works and how you put everything together, I saw like people asking like what's the best language to start with, pick whatever you like yeah in my experience it does it doesn't doesn't matter no because the the language the language you use like one of the things that like I was really, good at it was that I could pick up any language and I could probably make something decent in it you know because because I just ended up learning a bunch of languages and there are pros and cons with the tools you use and in the languages you use but ultimately you can you could do a lot with pretty much any language, so so the language you used doesn't matter so much what's really important is that you learn what you need to do with the language so like yeah so so just just so basically the short answer is just pick any tool any language and you'll start running into problems that you don't understand and then you google forever and you will learn how to overcome those problems and then you've done the learning that's that's the thing that you need to do that's like the core that's the valuable thing that you're going to carry with you regardless of what language your tool you're you're you're using it's like that like moment of learning that you just did that's that's the valuable thing yeah don't let anyone tell you that like no you gotta use this thing or whatever like find whatever you wanna use and you can make a game in anything even pen and paper is good practice I remember I had to do I had to write I had to write code in my university exam with pennsylvania oh yeah I just did that too yeah it's weird it's kind of stupid but at the same time they're not like super picky about no you know they're not going to be like your syntax was a little wrong because you would you would have caught it in a compiler or with your text highlighting you know so like they weren't too stupid about it but like yeah it was kind of weird
