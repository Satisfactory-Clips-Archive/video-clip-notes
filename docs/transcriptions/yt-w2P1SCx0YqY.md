### Transcript

> i want this feature right now people asking if you, if if you could have this build, i mean i guess the short answer is no it would be really cool to release them at some point but, i don't know there might need to be we have to sort of see like there may be references to like story maybe in these versions that if we release it yeah there is like there's there's maybe something that can come out like later after 1.0 or something but yeah we'll see and then yeah i guess we'd have to supply it on asus because oh boy this build crashes a lot actually i'm going to save right now because you don't want to re-pick up those leaves yeah
