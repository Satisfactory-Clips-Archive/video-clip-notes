> thank you hello everybody hello everyone sorry we're late it to be like that sometimes yeah how's that everyone Unity managers are never late precisely yes exactly yes yes yes precisely indeed playing voice meter yeah I was voicemeeters fall for sure that probably was generally is yeah actually I was telling, again about the rash flaring up again and it's all voice meter it turns out it was voice meter yeah oh hate to see it I hate to see it yeah is this what it is yeah we're here we're here and you're okay and we're all doing fine and, yeah this is a this is a pretty well it's a pretty special stream because there's a bunch of stuff happening today yeah it's this is gonna actually be a really really different stream than normal, this is not your run-of-the-mill stream this week no, that's why you got to tune in every week because you never know you never know if it's going to be like that 98 chance it's gonna be boring all [ __ ] except for the community highlights right but then out of nowhere it's it's like rolling in that 20 in d d you get a good stream it's like a [ __ ] gotcha it's like oh no but you gotta tune in every time because you never know you never know yeah that one time though it's gonna be good yeah yeah you never know it'll be Final Fantasy day exactly that's that's a pretty decent chance You're Gonna Roll the Final Fantasy that's for sure yeah it's it's like the other way if you want to avoid it then, yeah it could be an even more boring CEO and if you could never be more boring hey I enjoyed that interview by the way no I also enjoy that a lot yeah speak for yourself no I really enjoyed that it's not every day we get Stefan to join in on the Stream yeah voluntarily because every other time we we force them to be on air, this time he was like they'll be on or else, required yeah yeah so so, just just to give you all a little like, precursor like this stream we're going to be checking out going to Highlights, we're also going to be announcing the winner of the pass it on, Pioneer save thing, that me and Jace both participated in that was like two weekends ago or one week ago two weeks ago, yeah it was, two two weekends ago two weeks ago yeah organized by DC van so a bunch of community contact Raiders came together and, built on a safe file so we can announce the winner today as well, and then we're gonna have like a so, if you didn't know we have merch and, there's actually we have merch, actually and, one of our, partners with doing merch is, heroic replicas who's making, who's maintaining lizardogger.com and, we Jason and I both have like the big stuffed doggo, but it's not stuffed and we need to see to that so me and Jason are going to have a stuffing race which I love the [ __ ] I just love the premise of this the stuffing race, we gotta stuff it's nut yeah we're gonna stuff it so we're gonna be doing that today, so you get to be part of the experience and Jace is showing off these wonderful, thingies that you can get on lizard doggo.com yes we also have an announcement regarding that right like so stick around for the stuffing race yes right I'm pretty sure there's a thing right I didn't ask you about it now that you mentioned it wait I might just text my dad on yes it is oh my God I forgot about that yes yes it's Jesus right thank God I have you man holy crap I forgot about it too I just remembered right now oh I need to make a note with that because I completely forgot about it okay cool, is stream okay for everyone because like I have the stream open and it's kind of choppy for me but maybe it's just me I should just stop streaming it maybe it's, everyone else yes does that mean yes it's only Jace this fine looks good it's good it's okay okay it's okay it's it's okay it's the adequate answer because like it's never good it's always adequate me and my Aussie eyes hey that's fair, so first thing I need to do real quick though is because I got a doggo a plush dogger This Is How They come they come in these crates guys look check it out the crate is actually pretty cool yeah super sick like this is just like awesome to have in your your this is like a two in one you get the doggo and you get this crepe it's pretty cool yeah right, so I need to I haven't opened it yet because I need to take the stuffing out to let it breathe before I shove it in a doggo hahaha and expand whatever, but I figured I would save I would save, the unboxing for stream yeah on but we can you can never gotta Savor the peelies man or whatever it's not the PLS because it's but but you gotta Savor the hope you have something sharp it's a little tap here because like, when you buy the big doggo, you get it like it's not stuffed because to save on, shipping so you get to do that yourself and it comes in like the stuffing is like, vacuum sealed you get to do that yourself like it's a privilege I mean it's it's fun yeah I bet it's pretty fun could be fun here you go I mean we're about to experience it look at that I got I got I got more plushes oh I think I got a yellow Slug I don't have a yellow one I'm gonna blue and purple but I've got two paleberries now and two, nuclear waste the doggo brings you, pillberry and nuclear waste as we all know right this is what the sharp thing I'm gonna need this is stuffing I guess yep yep I'm gonna have to looks like a pillow straps here let them out I'm gonna breathe I'll do that in a sec and then here's the, the doggo skin that we just we just skinned the doggo okay you're like put it in the put it in the Box can you like put it as like a you know those like, what is it called the when you like skin an animal and wear it like as a as a coat or something like that yeah yeah it's it's either you wear it as a coat or you slurp it up like spaghetti you just slurp up something skin you ever done that before me neither sure we've all been there it looks so sad when it's like deflated
>
> [Laughter]
>
> very good it's amazing listen though go wait wait look a face only a mother could love yes oh God it looks it's so Derpy when it's not stuffed
>
> [Laughter]

> welcome to this developer stream today I will catch you all so glad Noah's watching this anyone got me food and if they were they're tuning out now yeah Jesus oh God all right we got some skin armor feels like proper armor good [ __ ] yeah oh you want me to do an actual doggo accent all right wait up but doing the right pitch at least I'm deflated you really got me with the, the the pitch there I was just gonna do the normal thing and I was like [ __ ] now I'm gonna do it in the pitch all right, I'm gonna go cut get some scissors man yeah I gotta go cut this real quick bareback gotta get go get cut ah my stomach hurts so yeah we're gonna be doing that after the community highlights and, Bob's your uncle sorry my dad was texting me is that a bundle it actually kind of does look like it right maybe maybe that's what silica is but it's not it's cotton, wait is it cotton oh [ __ ] I don't know there's like instructions here too on the packaging I have to do it oh my God this [ __ ] everywhere laughs, it's, assessment it's mostly harmless I'll be the judge of that mostly, by the way inside looks kind of cool look it's like drawings of Doggers on the outside wait oh there is wow so much thought went into this God damn it yeah maybe it is I can't well whatever I think it's cotton it doesn't feel like no it's probably something else it's like something oh whatever not interesting some kind of polyfill yeah it's like, hard to explain but it's good it's good it's good polyester that might be it I'm no I'm no, I'm no Savant at, textile, filling whatever old water bottles hell yeah so yeah do I just leave this out like this is that what I do that's what I did- I at first I was like I could put it in the Box, but then but then it was impossible to fit it so I just that's the point I guess yeah so, I just I just have it laying on the floor for now ethically sourced doggo guts yeah exactly Blended for consistency yeah I'm gonna eat this afterwards Yum Yum Yum free-range doggo yeah, apparently you might not need to use all the filling so like I've saved one bag in case I don't need but like also why would I not use all of it I guess yeah I mean I feel like if I don't use it all like what is the point then this this cushion here could use a little bit more on my chair so I'm gonna open it all up put it in my butt my butt needs some cushioning dude I have like the flattest butt anyways, so while Jace gets that all set up I'm gonna switch the scenes and jump over to community highlights, where are my notes wow that one's sick I would live there how it takes I haven't started yet too soon too soon give me highlights yes if you're new to the stream and you don't know what the hell's going on, every week we check out some stuff that's been made in community because God gosh darn people in community are for sure a lot more creative than we are like jeez it's, it's amazing let's see what people are doing good dog or scarf I love it if you see, ever seen, Ace Ventura 2 there's like, yeah yeah a long time ago yeah like there's a scene where where he sees he goes to like some some fancy dinner or something he sees Like A lady wearing a fox around her neck like that and he punches her husband and wears him like a scarf oh no I don't know why yeah it reminds me of that anyways, lizard doggo stuffing race oh boy it's finally happened a better stuffer it's not well when you put it like that I hope it's not me Jesus all right well I'm gonna gather my stuffing okay so so will I one area one second oh [ __ ] I shouldn't have put it in the Box because there's like instructions at the bottom oh maybe I need to like we'll figure that but we need some adult movie music wait what's the context here oh for the stuffing guys I'm trying to find the optimum stuffing position don't we all there's like instructions at the bottom of the Box I've unfortunately put all the stuff in the box so I don't know if I can turn it right now yep I just did that too yeah God damn it, actually let me I'm actually oh Jesus stuffing is making me sneeze okay so I'm gonna read the instructions real quick okay, because it says read all the EX read all of this guide before doing anything like okay, yeah so, unzip the zipper unfold the attached liner what liner the liner that's a good question unfold the what is the liner maybe like this like extra space you get between the yeah maybe I think so yeah because I think you want like last thing you want to do is like tuck that in, okay all right, I'm fully attached liner yeah I think that's what it is, so okay so find the bag of vacuums packaged stuffing I think we managed to do that and then yeah empty stuff in a large blah blah, fluff up the stuffing and allow to decompress that's what we've done, one handful at a time shove stuffing into the unstuffed lizard doggo I'm getting real essential here, start by packing the extremities so limbs tail and head first okay, scale tongue and ear strands are pre-stuffed so we don't need to do anything there when stuffing the head he used various densities of stuffing to find the desired shape various densities this is the most your head is very variously dense the density of your head is buried dude that's the nicest thing I've ever heard you say to me yeah, and then yeah tip you don't need to use all the stuffing supplied but well we'll see you're not the boss of me challenge accepted yeah a challenge, for a more relaxed oh it's got little toes oh yeah no beans for a more relaxed posture try removing or relocating stuffing in and around the joints when you're done roll up the liner back past the zipper and zip it up okay instructions no is this a butcher shop this isn't a Butch it's the opposite we are giving life to this to the doggo okay one way to put it currently it's this all right gather this [ __ ] up again all right I don't have a timer or anything oh [ __ ] all right, I can I can do a timer if we need to hey Siri all right are we ready one question before we start has your hellofresh arrived yet yeah oh David I was hoping it would arrive while we're doing this God damn it why would you hope that Jesus because no reason all right all right ready ready hey Siri start a stopwatch okay I didn't do [ __ ] thanks man are you ready okay here we go three two one go ah [ __ ] it, get in there you're [ __ ] get in there oh the light it's like the hole is much smaller than I thought don't take that out of context Jesus okay dude all right, one handful time, get in there all right I'm doing the extremities first like Dave says let's go I'm doing the head first oh he's got Stumpy little legs now are you doing the head first you're going against the, The Meta they outline the meta is there a meta is it you said legs first you said extremities first oh that's true it doesn't head count as an extremity extremity where's the tail there this is weirdly satisfying it is not I mean it is buy it buy it you guys I like it it feels like I'm back at, homeic completely stuck in my heart this is wearing just wearing the lizard tacos get in there Jace you can fit oh this stuff gonna look at my shirt my hoodie like more, more of attrition you know what you're [ __ ] cheating by the way oh that's true see anything you're doing oh [ __ ] I got like 10 people helping you right wait wait wait wait wait wait wait, I actually prepared a little something for this one second, how do I do this because like how do I show [ __ ] like the thing because the problem for me is like my headpiece maybe I can just put you on speaker because like my headspace is isn't doesn't reach far back enough so like I won't be able to hear you if I had it like that you're acting like it's a bad thing say again are you acting like that's a bad thing, sometimes sometimes I need I need you to whisper sweet nothing's into my my headphones it's a little little fun fact you guys don't know about this I record a little bit of
