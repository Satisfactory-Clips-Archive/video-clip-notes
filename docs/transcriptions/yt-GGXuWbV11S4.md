> important question have you seen models that some of the modders have made like custom ones and have they, have they inspired you, I haven't looked too I haven't I've played a couple of mods, but it was mostly, factory and building related and, I can't really have a well-founded educated opinion on mods because I haven't looked too much into it I gotta admit, because a lot of a lot of mods, stick to adding functionality or stick to, add new new wall types of foundation types and stuff like that so, I find that inspiring just to see what people come up with but, generally art wise, I haven't looked too much into that I really gotta admit but if you I don't know if there's any recommendations we'll have we'll have some community highlights after this and I think some of them will have some mods and so there's some things that we can look at and comment on when we get thro around to that so I know one worked with a mod that I really really really appreciate it is it the one that we talked about earlier yes then we'll get we'll get to it yeah yeah we'll see we'll get to it
