### Transcript

> so the first question that people ask that I want to follow up on was are we still adding Ben's water changes so if you remember the the water changes there was like the waterfall kind of the way that that looks it becomes like more sort of like volumetric and more kind of chunky and looks really good, we we showcased this, all of these changes on a tech art video that we put on our YouTube video a long time ago yeah it was so long ago it was like years like maybe one or two years ago that we did this and it's still not in the game so people running are they coming, that's waterfall and water current, yes they're still coming they're still coming, I can't say anything more I have some idea when they might be showing up but, they haven't been like, canceled or anything like that so you all can still look forward to better water in the future
