### Transcript

> tell you actually are conveyor belt mark 6 going to be a thing I don't know probably not I'm not sure yeah there's a bit of a technical issue right now there is it could only go so fast yeah like the the conveyables are kind of frame dependent a little bit right now so if we if it goes too fast you get like slight miscalculations yeah like, really fast conveyor belts and splitters and merges that's actually that's a math problem right there yeah it creates like an offset okay it's it's really weird to get that right it's like that is not easy yeah especially since we're using, we're using floating point precision for all the conveyor belts which gives just like just using the numbers themselves aren't exact yep
