> is directx 12 going to be don't come back, is directx 12 support going to become standard in future versions instead of optional so i'm pretty sure like in most games you can never like really, expect everyone to be able to use the latest, rendering api, so i like we would like to have directx 12 be enabled by default for most people and like have it work but it's you know it's not always the case that your hardware and and like your setup and like your such situ specific situation, that that directx 12 is the best option for you so it's it's like it's tricky to say that like this should be standard obviously there are things in directx 12 that are much more performant in our case, like draw calls stuff like that are way better in directx well so if in our game it makes a huge difference we would like it to be but i don't know if, how far like maybe at some point we don't know, it's it's like something that we kind of like have to see as we keep going whether or not like directx 12 11 is the better option by default or 12., it's it's something we're gonna like figure out as we keep working on it
