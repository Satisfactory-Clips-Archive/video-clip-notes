> hey chase the builds that you use for update trailers do you keep the build file, so I well I mean you're asking the wrong person because I didn't really get involved with those but snoop does do we have the build files for, we probably do, we're here I'm gonna let you guys in a secret here we're garbage at organizing when we do the trailers, we, sometimes we even like there was one point where- I asked like hey can we reduce this thing that we did and they were like oh that's gone dude that doesn't exist anymore, the the process of making the trailers is very like in flux all the time because we do things differently depending on what trailer we're making and sometimes we build in game sometimes we use the engine and create like very specific scenes that you can't load in game sometimes when we animate we don't like even do it in unreal engine, I think we capture real engine but we animate everything outside of it

> so for instance you know that lizard doggo scene at the start of update engine 5 update engine 5 update five, with the pioneers like walking past the, the the screen like the characters animated outside of unreal engine and then we created like a workaround to just add the scene it's kind of funky, it'd be like that sometimes but, so sometimes we have the build file but the thing is the build files aren't interesting because most of the time it's just like if we have a scene we create the build file to just fit that scene and there's nothing else going on, so they tend to be kind of boring, but we also don't organize anything so like once we're done with the with the trailer we're just like all right whatever, we could we could still share them I guess if people wanted to just like look at it yeah sure, sometimes we have stuff in the build files that are like engine specific that, can't load, this happened a couple of times when I shared with, with, on skim for instance it crashed the website, but yeah if there's if I can find some that'd be fun but, I was trying to find one recently I was trying to find the science one and I'm pretty sure I called it like poopy doopy doop doop and like I don't remember what I called it so I had to go through like every site fall so, yeah yeah the server rack that one is also special
