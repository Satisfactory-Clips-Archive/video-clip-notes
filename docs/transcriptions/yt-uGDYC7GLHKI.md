> another interesting question that I don't really know the answer to but like are you afraid that global warming and pollution gets so messed up by the time version 1.0 is released that current themes and buildings become uncomfortable depressing I think it's an interesting question yeah for sure and actually possible so, I mean- I'm bringing this question up not necessarily because I have an answer for it I don't, but sure that could happen that could be a thing hmm yeah I mean I guess I guess I guess I feel at the moment like well this is like a project that has been active for a very long time and so we just stay the course and just stay true to what we initially envisioned and just go with it and hopefully people don't see it too much as a statement but like sure that would be weird there's definitely an aspect of because one thing that that question also reminded me of is like, I don't know if you guys saw what's his name, jake ah what's his name whatever maybe chat will help me out in a second when I explain it so there's a youtube channel where they do very scientific like they take concepts in games and then explain like could that be feasible in real life, and there was, one video where they used like assets from satisfactory to talk about how, nuclear waste in games is not really how they work in real life, yeah exactly the nuclear waste video I remember what's the name of that channel I'm going crazy here, and you know like that kind of stuff too we're like we're sitting a kyle that's the name kyle hills yeah oh, where it looks like, thor yeah yeah yeah exactly, we're like you know our game can really set up like the thing we're talking about in our game consider precedence and I mean that's that's certainly happens in other games where like where you know for instance nintendo didn't want to release, advanced wars remake because of what's going on in the world you know and that kind of precedence certainly exists and it can always jump at ya from nowhere, and maybe in the future we'll be like looking back at satisfaction be like oh maybe you know maybe we didn't make a clear enough statement if we wanted to make a statement or whatever but it is a very interesting topic and it's something that definitely can happen in in many aspects of the thing and not necessarily specifically tied to satisfactory and like global warming anything like that but there's many topics where like you think back at it but I mean yeah that's that's how that's a snapshot of how it is right now is when we develop the game
