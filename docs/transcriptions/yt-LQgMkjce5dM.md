### Transcript

> is an easter event possible it's possible it depends on, just depends on how sort of things go, let's see if we're busy around that time or not, we also don't know if we want to we'll have to see we'll have to see if the team gets kind of excited for it or not if and if they're not really then we won't like we we we do we really like doing the christmas events, but if we keep like doing them for like all potential holidays then it might become a bit of a chore for us to do it and start eating away at the time that we have to actually you know improve the game so I don't know it we have to kind of just decide a little closer to easter even though we're very fairly close already but we would we would need to decide a little closer I think yes but I think we're probably a little focused on what we're doing right now yeah I mean it was hard to get like the fixmas event kind of last year into place as well because we were so focused on update 5 and like such a short notice and have a feeling it's gonna be the same case this year as well
