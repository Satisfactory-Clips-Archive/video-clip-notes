> yeah maybe maybe yeah who builds the factories in your oh well let's give it a proper answer that actually because the the the issue is the conveyor belts that like there's a precision issue with the way the belts work so we can't really like make them faster so the issue that we're facing right now is either we try and solve that issue like make the belts go faster so we can add like a mark six maybe in the future, or we look into getting like another output on the mark iii minor yeah we won't know until we like investigated the issue with the precision error but it's but it's all but it's also going to be it the I mean there is also sort of an element of moving the poles again the goal posts right like if we did do that and then and you could get the 1200 production out of the mk3 miners then you're just going to want to get four miners maybe so so we'll see but at the same time it also makes sense to be able to utilize its actual output I mean we did that for for, nuclear power plants for instance you couldn't overclock nuclear power plants until, update before, just because of the way they were set up but I believe in that case we actually changed a little bit more so how recipes were set up so that might also be something we do, but like there's gonna be a point where you can utilize everything in the game like right now you can't overclock minor mark three minors because you can't get everything out but at some point you can you don't get anything out of it exactly exactly so like it doesn't make sense to do it so like at some point we're gonna even it all out make sure all the numbers make sense
