> so the week after we uh we got a drone photographer to come in and he took uh that shot and a few extra shots that we could use um there's this shot coming up here the drone photographer also took that as well so here we are in the main so that was also something that we like i knew the reveal for drones that was like a shot that i had in my head like super early on like i wanted to like comp it in outside of our office like we're being sworn by drones somehow and uh we had no way of shooting that of course without an actual drone like the filming drone so we actually i was like i i i just made like a at everyone at coffee stand and be like does anybody know a photographer whoever that does like drone shots and then our um our hr manager she she was like i found these she just found like a couple of uh companies and i just like emailed back and forth with a few of them and then we found matthias uh who his company is called rec 116 i think uh and he had done like a lot of cool like a really beautiful like drone footage of huevde and i was just like all right i'm getting i'm gonna contact this dude um so yeah he filmed those drone shots uh the one thing that i was afraid of uh during those shots is like if people see that we're filming with the drone because it's very obvious that it's a drone shot there it could be a crane shot but there's no way we have our crane right yeah and i was afraid like are people gonna like figure out that it's about oh that is drones yeah um but i don't think anyone really caught on that they just thought no production value
