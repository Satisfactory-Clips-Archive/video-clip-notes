> I thought the leak was the weather, being introduced to the game maybe well actually I mean that weather thing was, like we said in the, I think in the tweet when we when we shared that we're just like just a thing that he's been working on we don't know what we're gonna do with it yet and that was the whole truth, we don't know what we're doing with it yet but, you know we're sort of interested in it and we were really interested in people's feedback people gave a lot of feedback some things that they did like about it they didn't like about it or concerns that they've had about weather effects in other games, and, yeah you know not just nice or that like a lot of the team were reading those comments too and they heard you so like I don't know what's happening with weather effects I don't like I genuinely don't know but, if we have them, you can also just you know consider that your your concerns that people had or feedback that people had have been heard okay
