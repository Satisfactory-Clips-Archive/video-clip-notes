### Transcript

> item stand from the awesome store oh yeah that's that's an upload for the keyway side if anything that's that's pretty like, you know how like some people build, conveyor belts out of their, storage containers to see like what item is in the storage container like a similar thing to that I saw what I'm assuming they mean so like you can put items on a stand so you can see like display it yeah right yeah that's something yeah I think an item sounds like a good idea like I feel like you know people have been requesting signs for storage containers though I feel like that would solve that particular thing but I think an item stand in general is kind of cool just like aesthetically but even with science if you if you have like a an array of storage containers that you're like you know the the kibbit style corridor of containers like you can maybe the science will be in the way if you put them in front of this container or something I don't know I don't know yeah maybe I guess that's something yeah that's going to think about but the item stand sounds like pretty nice because it's also like the golden cup and like the, the trophies like you might want to place them or something yeah but you can make your own kind of thing like sort of thing yeah I'll put that on the keyboard yep it's 1400 volts put it in right away
