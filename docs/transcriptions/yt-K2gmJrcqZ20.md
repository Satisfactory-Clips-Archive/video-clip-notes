> any thoughts about non-first-person building mode especially when landing tracks pipes i have hard times seeing the whole thing at once yeah that is, that is just a general difficulty when when switching to, when making the game in in first person right so we've had to do things that try to mitigate that right now the the easiest way that people, get around it is build towers or you know foundation towers or something like that so you can build from a higher vantage point, or using the, maybe using the hover pack if you have other power you know lines or whatever around, but, yeah so as for like a third person mode for building i don't think that's planned or i actually you know it's been it's been a long time there was a period where people asking about third person like every single week and we answered that question every week and we haven't it hasn't been asked for a long time so i don't actually know what the status of third person is i don't know if it's something that we're actually gonna do or not
