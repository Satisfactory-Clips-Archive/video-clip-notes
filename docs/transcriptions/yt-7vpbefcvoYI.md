> can we go over the front train fixed in a little more detail not really, because i don't think we know for sure what we're going to do well we have some ideas of what we want, but because that's not the fix that we're doing now, as far as i understand it we're not fleshing it out completely yet so it's like i can't really give you more detail because we don't have more detail yet because it's not what we're doing right this second
