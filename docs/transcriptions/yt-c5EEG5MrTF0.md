> any new animals go up that's that's backwards yeah, no new animals in update four we've been, wanting to add the like crab boss to the game a long time that was teased in the, tees no in the reveal trailer gameplay reveal trailer whatever in one of the early trailers we showed off like it was the e3 trailer I think we showed off like a crab enemy that we still haven't added to the game and the reason we haven't been able to do that is because we need to update some of the ai systems in the game to be able to, have it in there otherwise it's gonna just look weird, you may have seen the issues with the aipathem pathing system with the, the tick sometimes just like walking through your base and stuff like that, so we need to solve that first before we can add it and, I don't exactly know when that's gonna happen but, hopefully sooner than you think probably later than you hope
