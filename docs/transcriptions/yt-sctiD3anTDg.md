> it sounded like you had a question that you were about to read out and I interrupted you yeah you did- I'm sick of these interruptions, I did but it's oh no it's, jimmers was saying we've met the lego goal this is true so let's see if, we might have a lego command we do does that actually go somewhere, it goes to the page it does yeah so, here's here's the situation guys all right so let's hear it we did meet the, the requirement for the lego thing and the way it works is when you reach the requirement it's added to like a list of things that when it comes to they have like a quarterly, review period, the folks at lego so it's added to that list now so we're just kind of waiting on on like results from that review to see if they think it could be like a thing that they want to create and if so they might want to tweak the design, or you know if they have other opinions about it, so we'll see we'll see what happens I don't know when the next like review period, happens I think it's in may actually so it's somewhat soon, but that's we're just sort of waiting, on on them getting back to to us right now so probably not won't see movement until that quarterly review period starts so that's the state of lego, if it gets made will you please do a race to build, to see you can build it first yeah we can maybe just oh that sounds like fun get your lego foo running
