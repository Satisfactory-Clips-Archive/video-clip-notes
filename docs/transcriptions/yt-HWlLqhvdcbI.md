### Transcript

> what happened with the conveyor belt skill was in the game for a few hours no longer in the game so there is unfortunately an issue with, some of the modded content if you use mods and you're into an issue where like the customizer no longer show skins and stuff like that, it is unfortunately because of mods, to my understanding at least I haven't talked too much about people in canada this bug but we've somewhat confirmed that, people that are running into this issue it's because of the mods they've installed maybe there's a fix I think we're working with the modders to solve that issue, but we don't have a solution right now I mean why would we because we didn't make them odd but, it's like a bigger problem than just like the mod did it or whatever this there's something with how we save with the saves of stuff like that we're looking into but it really I think the the cost of that bug was because of mods or something I don't know not quite sure sml breaks the skin on register item which gets deleted okay yeah there's some there's something with that I'm not I'm not quite sure because I haven't I haven't listened during the meetings we haven't had time to like work a lot this week because we're doing the retrospective so we've just like brought it up but we haven't had time to look into it properly
