### Transcript

> actually this is something that we can probably point out and give a little bit more information on because we have spotted kind of an inaccuracy but we can we can, explain a little more here so, what's the deal here us yeah so they they look like cats that's kind of weird what's that we don't have cats in our hands so obviously this is arachnophobia oh yeah really I want to just mention this real quick but our wiki contributors have have created arachnophobia mode for the wiki itself and I think that's super great because some people can't you know stand the side of spiders or whatever and so it's really nice that by default it shows the cats on the wiki and then of course you can turn it off if you want to see the actual spider creatures themselves so, you know huge props to wiki contributors there really love that but yeah what's what's the deal here snip so according to the wiki they they list four different stinger types, which is like half true I guess or not really true because there's only three different types in game really but we have, like data wise we have four different stinger types but the only main difference between one of these is that they spawn in a different location I think we call them like cave singer or something like that, so really there are there are like three different stinger types there's like the yeah it's evil yeah right here in the in the trivia yeah, so so that doesn't like they don't have like different, ai or anything like that, I think they function the same way like just that the different types have like different health or something like that, so the ones that are listed here at the bottom it's more due to the fact that where they spawn rather than like there are different stinger types right one thing that I'm noticing is that here with their like stats they actually have different sets like 10 10 50 30 100 300 and 100 and this one has like gas so I mean if this is true these are four different yeah stats what's the deal there I don't know because because some of this data on the wiki is like datamined from different builds of the game and sometimes we've uploaded accidentally like stuff in the build that shouldn't be in the game, so maybe sometimes they when people have data mine the game they find information that like isn't accurate because it's never used really but they find like the data essentials right okay well I guess, I guess we can also double check this again, just to make sure that like this isn't really the case and we'll leave our verdict on the screen right here wow I can't look at that it turns out that this is the truth actually great hey everyone it's jason from the future here with the verdict okay so the deal is you guys there are actually three types of stingers okay and here are their stats, we call them the baby stinger the alpha singer and the elite gas stinger, and you can see there these are the stats for them now we also have these other kinds of stingers like a variation of these called cave stingers and each one of these has a cave version of themselves and they're exactly the same in every way the only difference is, when they spawn so normal stingers only spawn during the night time cave stingers spawn during day and night the intention is that we would put them in the caves and they would always be there regardless of time of day but we also use some of the cave stingers outside in the in the world as well such as in the swamp or in the red jungle as well so, but yeah basically there are only three types, and then we just have the variations of whether or not they can spawn during day or night so, back to you guys oh yeah so one thing I want to say real quick about this here okay so we have we have the one we have the cats here this is one of natalie's cats and their name is freya but that is not listed anywhere on the on on the wiki so if you want to add that if if that's wiki worthy this cat's name is freya the other cat's name is here right here I it's hard for me to pronounce this name it's a really right it's a hard neighborhood I mean yes it is at least for me I'm not swedish so this name is really really hard to pronounce for me so I'm just gonna leave it on the screen here, and the other one is yeah that's, sophia concept artists cat and also no representation of that cat here I mean maybe we could get a picture of the other cat here that would be cool so next up we were looking at the object
