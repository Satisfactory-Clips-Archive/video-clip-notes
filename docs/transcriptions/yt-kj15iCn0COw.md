### Transcript

> so yeah so what we're going to do now is going to make smaller frames like i mentioned before so one thing i like to do is i like to start at the end so like i know i'm making model frames so let me place down like just a an assembler to just like see what i'm making here right so modeler frames require reinforced iron plate and it requires iron rods you can also see the numbers here tell you like at what capacity or like what speed uh you need in order to like produce this number on this side so in order to make two model frames per minute we need 12 iron rods per minute and we need three reinforced items per minute might sound like a lot of math uh but like it's it's if you break it down it's quite simple you need to make sure that you get this many into the machine in order to get like this many out you don't have to because like it so long as this machine just gets the parts it's going to produce at some point yeah if you're supplying like not enough parts or too much then you'll just produce lower or if you're giving too much it can't really produce much quicker but exactly uh so like efficiency drops but you don't have to be completely efficient or anything like that um you know your parts will still get made exactly so so you're gonna do a pretty just a naive sort of build just to get it running right exactly so it needed reinforced iron plates which we also use an assembler to build or is it called manufacturer nobody knows um and this one requires uh 30 iron plates per minute and 60 screws per minute so it needs iron plates and screws that's what we care about right now and the other side of this we needed uh iron rods yeah so i'm just gonna place down these two here or something i'm not gonna make it super pretty i'm just gonna get it working um and then yeah these all these resources come from the iron iron ore by the way so we already know that like we have pretty much all we need um so what i'm going to do now is i'm going to place down some smelters so that's the first step in this chain and place them over here i think oops never make enough screws in the game screws are the people's enemy actually yeah these are pretty good um and then we're just gonna split this off its input here so if you look at the smelter now you can see that the smelter needs 30 iron ore per minute to make 30 ingots so how many ingots did we need let's check that um yeah we need to make plates and screws first so put down some machines here middle middle lay here for plates we need 30 ingots per minute that's convenient so let's actually start producing why not well why not start doing this just start producing so we can see
