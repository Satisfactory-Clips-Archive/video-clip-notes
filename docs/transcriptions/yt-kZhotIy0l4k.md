> does mark play satisfactory do you play satisfactory mark no dog game good answer you're hired again, I'm assuming you mean like on on our free time because or like how how much do you play play the game when you're working at work, I mean I never play play right because that's kind of the problem I think when you're working on the game is that even when you're playing it you're not really really playing it and that's what makes it kind of tricky because you're always looking at things that you can improve things that need to be fixed, issues that you see it's it's you can't really get immersed in the same way that when you play a game that you're not working on I used to play a bunch with my brothers because of course I live quite far away from them so we play games online together to keep in touch and my older brother especially quite liked the game so we played a bunch together but I mostly let them kind of do stuff and just kind of was watching them and how they were playing and I was just kind of around with stuff and then you're like yeah but it's it's quite different for me to play because I know I know all these, I mean essentially it's just a combination of puzzles I think like that's how we design it when it comes to like ratios and production lines and the balance of recipes so that aspect to me is is quite different I think because I kind of know what I feel is good already from out of the box and I still enjoy building them as well so I can get decently immersed when I'm actually just trying to play a test and then so they should kind of just forget to take notes and stuff yeah but mostly when I started the game it's to test very specific things right it's play testing at work it's not like actually playing for the game it's doing very specific scenarios and on my own time I haven't really played in a long time yeah last night most times when I play it's mostly to build trailer stuff so I never think too much of what I'm making I'm just placing stuff that looks nice yeah so- I feel ya mark complaining with about overclocking to his brother his brother's like what are you talking about I don't get it I don't get how it works
