> thank you so much for submitting everyone we use our we used to we use twitter and reddit mostly to find these great snapshots, if you're on twitter make sure to use the hashtag satisfactoryscreenshots and if you're on reddit make sure to use the, flare that's on reddit, that's that's called screenshot, some people ask me if like oh do you only pick from like the front page and no I don't because that's the main thing about using the screenshot flare is that it doesn't filter out you know based on likes and we usually go back, like the previous seven days and take a bunch of stuff from that period so, like like I know that whenever I select stuff on twitter and reddit, sometimes you know in in the in the past 24 hours there's going to be like 10 amazing things and I've got all these tabs open but then I'm always like I always push myself and be like no go the whole seven days because there's sometimes good stuff that was shared five days earlier and it would be unfair to, sort of like cut them out, and then you're faced with a the tough decision of cutting some things out and picking the best ones so yeah there's always going to be a picking of sorts at some point
