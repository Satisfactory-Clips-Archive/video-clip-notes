> it was free and epic once believed yeah we had the, we've had a free weekend once we could try it and that was a one thing that was like before the game was out, that's the only time we will ever do that I believe or rather I don't think we'll do that again I mean it's it's it's impossible me to know that but as far as I know we have zero plans for that in the future I have a friend who got it for free and epic or so they told me then your friend probably got a, pirated version of the game because or they managed to swindle a key from someone but yeah they lied if they send a guy for free not in a legal sense like you shouldn't be able to get the game for you for free at all
