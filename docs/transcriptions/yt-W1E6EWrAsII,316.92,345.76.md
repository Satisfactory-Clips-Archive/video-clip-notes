### Transcript

> Is the map procedurally generated? Will there be procedurally generated resource locations? There will be no procedurally generated maps or resources I have no idea if that's something that's going to change in the future or not. A lot of people have expressed some concerns that if there is no procedural generation there will be no replayability but please understand that we have kept replayability in mind during development and we have some plans for it. But of course, we're still welcome to suggestions. Especially suggestions that don't require procedural generation! Will you localise satisfactory into X language?
