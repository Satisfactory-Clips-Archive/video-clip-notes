> hey everyone my name's Jace I'm a community manager coffee stain studios and today we're talking about the serious stuff we're talking about why am I wearing a beanie in the middle of summer inside and that is because my hair cannot be tamed today so this is what we're rolling with but we're also talking about sales so the number of sales of satisfactory something that I think a lot of people are interested in and you know like last year we announced when we hit five when we hit 500,000 sales on epic which was about like around this time last year I think and yeah so that was that was crazy at that time all right that will very happy and thank you all so much for that support at that time but is it has been a another year and we're out on steam as well so let's have a look at how many sales that we have we have made right so the total number of sales get ready boy signals is 1 million three hundred and twenty six thousand five hundred and eighteen copies of satisfactory has been sold between steam and epic which I can't even understand the number you know what I mean it's just like so big I'm just kind of like okay like that's that's good and everyone's like yeah that is good I don't know like that's just bonkers and something I just kind of want to say though is like revealing numbers like this and that they're if they're good and like they're good I feel like we'll always be like a little wonky it's like oh my God look at how many numbers like the numbers look how many copies that we sold it's like look how amazing we are and and that's not like I don't know like maybe that's still happening but but that's not the the place that this idea has come from you know I just think the transparency is really important I've always been as transparent as possible I think some people they they want to know the numbers they're curious about it and then we know the numbers so like why not like why not do this you know is this like safe for kids yeah so that's kind of just where it's coming from and I think a lot of people would be interested so yeah but those numbers aren't pretty damn good thank you everyone thank you so much for this I don't think anyone was ever expecting this when we made the game yeah it's amazing thank you so much so let's do a little breakdown a lot of people might want to know how much was on one thing and how much was on the other so the total number is sold on Steam is 1 million three hundred twenty-six thousand five hundred and nine and epic is nine yeah I told you like a year ago we only sold nine on epic and no one else bought it people would buy it then refund and articles were written on this we only sold nine on epic thank God steam came along I'm kidding not that I need to say that I'm kid apparently I need to say that I'm kidding with with jokes like this but I'm kidding so for real though epic on epic we sold nine hundred and fifty eight thousand nine hundred and seventeen copies and on Steam three hundred and sixty seven thousand six hundred and one copies again crazy numbers on both an incredible success on both so that's yeah I mean that's just amazing we could we could pretty much see here though that like if you if you were if you wanted to compare the two and we don't really care about that but I know you guys some folks out there I'm gonna start comparing and making inferences and that's fine but if you wanted to compare them I think steam so far is selling quicker than gained epic epic game store so epic sold in about three months or something five hundred thousand the total number sold on Steam in about a month or whatever has sold 360 thousand so it's slated to probably overtake what epic did at that time there's a few really obvious reasons for it you know obviously steam is just a Goliath so there's just so many more people there so that is that is gonna weigh into things another thing to consider is that there has been the summer sale and we have been on like the top sellers we were at like first or top three for a very long time and we're still in the top ten throughout the summer sale we did have a sale in Epic during those first three months as well but it wasn't in the first month so that could be throwing the numbers off a little bit who knows having said that I still in my opinion I mean I think steam is gonna overtake it there's just more people and nothing's to consider satisfactory is a better game now there's more features I decide one more year of exposure okay so that is those are the numbers I don't really know how to wrap up his video because it's it's honestly just awkward I just hope that this was interesting I hope that this wasn't like a shitty video to make you know what I mean I just hope it was interesting and I hope for those of you who are part of the community I hope this makes you happy to hear as well that's we're doing wealth is a race car that we're all doing well not only us but but you guys within the community you're part of something that is succeeding so thank you all to everyone who plays satisfactory who bought the game the numbers are awkward all right well anyway black comments subscribe we stream on Tuesdays on Twitch and another video will be out on Thursday or Friday next week bye
