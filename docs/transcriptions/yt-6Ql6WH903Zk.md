> when can we when can we expect development to slow down due to holidays so summer break, and then to continue and does that mean that many features for update five are somewhat finished and just not leaked, so i think when do the holidays start is it next month that's such a good question this one it's next month i think because i i have four more weeks before vacation so it's probably next month and i but i'm early so are you i i think i am okay so sometime within the next month or two and then like pretty much the whole thing's gonna shut down for like maybe two weeks or something yeah minimum so for people that don't know like in sweden it's pretty common that like when we go on vacation sweden has a very tight corner of like or window of when we actually have good weather and stuff like that so a lot of people a lot of companies in sweden take hiatus during july august june july august that kind of period and like everything slows down here it's it's like a it's just a thing, so and that affects the game as well jason jace hold the fort i will i believe the plan is that i would hold the fort indeed, yeah but then as for whether or not many of the features are done it doesn't really suggest anything really like it's it's always hard to tell when a lot of times when you're making things like a lot of things kind of get done but then everything falls together kind of in the end so many things might be done yeah, before going on break but they still need to be tied together and that can be a process in itself so yeah yeah the original plan was to be done before vacation with update five but that was when it was a much smaller update and then we kind of realized that ah maybe not maybe you should not try and push it out before vacation because it's kind of tricky to do that especially if you like if we were to put the game on experimental and then go on vacation for like a month or two and it's like a really buggy version of the game for a while so it just didn't feel good so after vacation
