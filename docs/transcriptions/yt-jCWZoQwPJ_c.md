> have any of the css devs dipped into moonlighting with modding I don't know do you mean like if we are making mods or if we've tried mods we've definitely tried mods because sometimes, sometimes we've had ideas of stuff that we like maybe this is a good idea to make for the game, a lot of also a lot of mods that have been created have been things that we were like internally leaning towards making and then when we see that there's a huge interest in a mod that we were actually planning to make that's like a good like indication that like yeah cool we're onto something here, and sometimes we see a mod that like something that we initially felt like this is not something we will do and then we try out the mod and we're like yeah it it it didn't work the way we anticipated, but I don't I don't think there's anything bad with that either because you know the game can be a lot of different things you know if somebody makes a mod for tower defense we won't be like oh that mod shouldn't exist you know it's still a good mod if somebody does that but it's not the game that we want to make so, I don't want to shun like all the other mods that have been created that like we probably won't add to the game, for various reasons I think they're they definitely there's a place for those, and a space for those as well and I don't think they should just because we don't have any intention to add them to the game it doesn't mean that they're bad but it's not the game that we want to create and a game that makes sense for like everyone, so yes
