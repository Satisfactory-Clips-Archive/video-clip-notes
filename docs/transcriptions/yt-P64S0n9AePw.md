> twisted metal yeah did you play twisted metal back in the day i did oh god such a good game oh that was ps was it on ps1 as well or just ps2 it was ps1, it was definitely on ps1 i'm pretty yeah certain just a metal one was at least on this one but i think it was also on ps2 great games one of those games could see me playing that again for funsies it's one of those games where metal two no yeah twisted metal two was also on ps1 there was that just another world tour i think something like that that's the one that i played to death it was really fun you could like blow up the eiffel tower and stuff back in the day we didn't have you i don't know with this super fun it's one of those games where like if somebody made a new game like that i don't think i would be like super interested yeah same like i i don't feel like it would it like by today's standards of you know games and stuff i don't know if it would like fly but like i would i would love to like go back and play it for nostalgia's sake you know yeah it was a brand new game i'd probably be a bit blurry about it that's sort of the issue with like those games where they they kind of set like the formula that like then a lot of other games also took so like now even though it was the first of its kind to do in a certain way like if you look at it now it just looks like us one another blah and others have probably done it better since because they built upon it yeah, there's one thing one thing i realized, kind of off topic too but, do you remember space quest it's like an old atari game point like point and click, it's like a point-and-click game right so the people who made that game, they did like a kickstarter for to make like a new successor sort of you know and it you know when you look at that that game that they're making it just like doesn't look like anything special because it but it is the same vein as the first one so like if if i didn't know that it was the original creators i would be like right it just looks like a what what's already out there kinda it's it's tricky it's it's a it's a weird effect or whatever that happens from from there being too many goddamn games there's a lot of games there's a lot of games which is good but it's hard to like get that feeling that like oh this is something actually legit new yeah back back in my day when you you would just get like random games and, you would never really know if they were going to be any good or not you didn't have access to everything so you kind of just tried what you had access to yeah and that was always kind of it's absolutely hidden miss but end up finding a lot of gems that is true because i i feel like i've worked on games that like or played games that i you know initially looking at it doesn't look like that much fun and then like when you actually get into it it actually is a lot of fun yeah and it feels like we're we're quicker to like filter out the type of experiences and games that we feel like i probably wouldn't like this what the  there's a bunch of cats over here oh oh god i just looked over like six of them that's terrifying okay we're good that was terrifying, i didn't bring the zipline with me god damn it i think so so like my point was here that you know back in the day when you actually had to kind of play it to try it and that stuff i feel like you found more games that you enjoyed yeah i think i think it's also like, folks try to min max the games that they're getting these days yeah like using all the reviews and stuff and and i guess that ends up being that you end up playing better games probably but like it's just like it's just a different mindset yeah back then you just had some lying around you play it some new game you know was, added to the library at blockbuster you know so you're like i guess i'll try it because what else are you gonna try yeah i used to rent games too i forgot about it yeah yeah yeah yeah that's something that you cannot like look at all those boomers sitting here talking about this but that is actually something that like it's kind of hard to, mimic today yeah i think so like getting a game over the weekend and like that's the game you had yeah because because by every measure i guess it's better now right well you don't need to do that yeah you know i guess i guess it's better but it's there's still like a lot of memories you know of that kind of stuff and they're very fond memories my dad was always like in with the, because my dad has like seen every movie known to mankind like ever like he watches everything and so back in the day when we had, video stores like rental stores, he would be buddy buddy with like all the owners of all the, rental stores in the neighborhood and he would like you know go you know from one to the other and he'd be like yo so what's coming like let me know and they would always put a copy of the new stuff aside for him specifically when you stuff dropped yeah and so he would know about games as well they're like yo this game is big it's you know whatever and then he'd be like all right i'll get that one for my kid yeah it's pretty nice that's pretty cool yeah but it really is a thing that will never come back huh like it it's never i don't see how that could ever get replicated ever again no and and i feel like it was such it's such a short period of time too like like when film began being like a thing that you could rent and watch at home to the point that that was like no longer necessary anymore you know it was such a short, time period i guess the like close to it the closest one is like maybe when you like know a game dev and you get like a preview build or something right yeah yeah yeah there are other things that are replaced yeah for sure did your stores have five-day rental periods for games the ones that we had were one night, usually like their overnight or two nights, and then you could do weekly i believe that was the standard i think, i definitely remember doing the thing where you rented over the weekend i think that i did that the most like you return it on monday again oh yeah one thing i also fondly remember is, like i can't remember what magazine it was it was playstation magazine or whatever where you got like a little demo disc in every minute yeah dude that was great yeah yeah that was so good i love those damages yeah every month you get another magazine yeah cause like that's how i discovered like metal gear like one of my favorite games oh really yeah there's a demo of metagear on one of them like the first part of the first level and it's so weird because like as a kid i would play like i'd play the the out of those demos yeah i played over and over and over yeah yeah i'll just keep playing it over and over i played nothing but demos for a while it's fun fun times one disc had special missions and metal gear diner crisis and soul reaver wow on the same distance that's wild yo on the same disc yeah that's wild oh that's wild, anyone play what was that game called same studio that made diner crisis, it was like a virus and you were out shooting aliens that got people's bodies how was that game called parasite eve thank you yeah oh i never played that my cousin had that game also a game that has not aged well like some games you have had you you must have played them when they came out to be able to like play them again i feel like i feel like there was like a thing around, you know early 3d or maybe even just 3d stuff in general maybe, like kind of doesn't age super super great, oh my god stars are like the earl the earlier stuff like on snazz and stuff like that stuff just looks exactly like it always did yeah star wars master of terrace cassie oh my god that stupid game it's like a star wars fighting game on the playstation yeah it's wild it is and like half of the characters aren't even star wars characters very nice who made that, i don't know it was like they i think they just like went bankrupt it's like immediately after they made that game nice because i really i really do remember like being in the the store or whatever seeing that game be like wow i do like star wars and that was the whole premise why i got that game i do like punching yeah
