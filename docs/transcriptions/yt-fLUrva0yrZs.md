> will you add micro transactions no i don't think so nothing nothing planned at least i mean you never say never but i i don't think so my current section is such a like oh i don't want to touch that with a 40-foot pole and i don't think anyone at coffee slam wants to touch that with a 40-foot pole especially not since seeing us how like you know we're in a really good state, we're really fortunate with how the game has been doing so i guess it's easy to be like oh let's, let's add microtransactions to the game and think about all the money we could make blah blah blah but we've never really had that intent i think i think we are game developers first and foremost and we are in a good spot to really take our time to work on the game first and foremost not on our company you know, because we have other vendors, or not vendors but like we have other ways you know to make coffee stand go around and then just our game, so because we do investment in other things as well so like this i don't know this very business business business i don't really care about the business business i only care about our game and our you know what we're doing, but yeah i don't think we'll have microsoft transactions except the one dollar dlc flush dlc that's the only exception okay i know i just went on our whole rant about how like no we would never do anything like that and there's like complete 180 here but this is this that's the exception okay
