> with more space for higher tiers
> currently we don't have any plans to uh
> we're gonna wait and see how people view
> it but there's you get the one blueprint
> designer in the game and that's it
> uh how long do you think it will take
> for people to make a website that can
> share uh generate blueprint files uh
> pretty sure that that already exists at
> this point maybe uh and Thor is working
> on on uh skim uh has been working on
> this and I think Greenie who's been
> working on the
> the
> that's actually tools website so I'll
> look into that so and I'm sure there's
> going to be a couple of other uh sites
> popping up there might even be a
> subreddit I saw someone so I think I saw
> someone mentioning that they created a
> subreddit for just sharing blueprint
> files
> um I don't think uh we'll uh like we
> have had uh in our Discord and like on
> our
> um platforms we've been kind of adamant
> not to let people posts like save files
> and stuff like that because we're such a
> huge community and we're scared that
> like people will post like viruses stuff
> like that and I think we're going to
> keep that mentality for blueprints as
> well I mean we could potentially make a
> script that can like check the
> executable or whatever or I executable
> but the file people upload and make sure
> that it is following like the blueprint
> format potentially but I don't think we
> are going to do that because that's more
> work and
> boy howdy we don't have a boy we don't
> have enough work on our hands on this
> um
> but I'm sure there's going to be sites
> that that will allow that and stuff so
> it will be easy for you guys to share
> and talk about blueprints designs and
> share that stuff away
> but yeah please be careful if people are
> posting files and stuff like that
> because you you got to be careful on the
> internet okay don't trust only trust uh
> trust your instincts I made a bad choice
> making the file extension.exe
> it's not it's done it's not uh that's
> actually another good point because yeah
> right now it's two files yeah there's
> two files in there yeah one is the
> actual blueprint and that's all you
> actually need to get the blueprint
> um loaded and the game will recognize
> that there's another one that's like a
> satisfactory blueprint config file it
> has a long extension on the end and that
> just holds information about like the
> icon the description and uh the color
> and that was just so we could change and
> set that data really easily without
> having a ton of network overhead for
> clients um so you only need the one but
> both if you want to keep your pretty
> picture and icon and everything yes but
> I think it is doable to get it in one
> file or question mark doable to get in
> one file yeah I mean everything's
> everything I mean you just you just put
> it into a zip no yeah I mean I had it in
> one file initially yeah so but then I
> stripped it out because it was causing
> more overhead than I figured they don't
> even need this
> um if they don't want it and for file
> sharing they just need the one so
> um
> already getting a little bit of good
> feedback actually uh forget don't forget
> to post you don't want to post it here
> you want to post it in the queue on the
> QA side
> um
> let's see
> train Lanes no power
> train lines all right that sounds like a
> huge oh that's uh yeah yeah are you
> talking about the uh
> hover pack
> I wonder who knows but the best way best
> way to know is to give us more detailed
> information on the QA side really uh
> yeah well I was gonna say I think we
> already fixed that bug essentially and
> the house
> we originally didn't make the build uh
> epic is slow so don't forget to refresh
> the the application for epic it might be
> that it's a bit slow yeah
> um but is it we have pushed the button
> so it is coming
> anytime
> uh 128 128. that's that's a big chunker
> that's not happening yeah imagine a
> client placing that down yeah so coal
> generator fit not yet I don't think in
> this release yeah and I think the thing
> where last time we talked about it the
> the approach what we're going to do is
> we're going to change not the like look
> of the cool generator but unlike the
> physical look but maybe the the bounding
> box like the the thing you don't see uh
> to be 32 by 30 32 high so it fits in the
> blueprint designer uh just barely
> um because the only thing that affects I
> guess is like the soft clearance yeah
> yeah uh but I mean it will also affect
> heart clearance because we will just
> reduce the clearance size okay yeah
> because the clearance for the gold
> generator is now the exact shape of the
> building gotcha so like the downside of
> that would be that you can potentially
> place a building within like the little
> top yeah I build a floor up there and
> then just build a Constructor through it
> but gotcha I think that's kind of up to
> I mean that's always been kind of up to
> players into itself clearance I think
> that's gonna be fine it's like the path
> of least resistance when it comes to
> like figuring out how to make that work
> because I think that's easier than like
> change because we try to change the
> model and it looked super silly yeah we
> changed it so that the pipe was like
> smaller but they made it made the whole
> gener look weird
> um so uh yeah refiners do fit right
> they're 30 31 meters so I think you can
> even place a foundation on it which
> might be well exactly what we will do
> with the height of the cool generator
> clearance I said we will make it 31
> meters so you can place a one meter
> Foundation underneath yeah it in here as
> well
> uh let's see here whoops a Refinery I
> think refineries are like third uh 30.
> oh maybe it doesn't say yeah but the
> refiner to stay in here I I saw that a
> lot of people are worried about that uh
> and I probably should have made it like
> included in the video
> um
> because the buildings that don't fit are
> like nuclear power and uh nuclear pasta
> uh particular accelerator railroad
> railroad station there's also like the
> lights Tower uh which is a bummer yeah
> radar Tower
> um it's mostly buildings that you
> usually don't put out put down too many
> off anyways like refiner you still have
> Refinery like late game Refinery party
> uh so so we got you covered there
> um
> but they they yeah they all fit
> um
> one thing that I also kind of want to
> talk about is I saw a lot of people
> talking about how like yeah going back
> to the size right so so like a lot of
> people were that sure with Constructors
> is fine because that's a small building
> they're only like one by one but like if
> you're making like a manufacturer thing
> you can only fit like one really uh like
> because you can
> yeah like that won't fit
> um I think it's important to note that
> like
> you know the idea isn't that you're
> supposed to be able to create the the
> thing that I made with the manifold with
> like it was eight uh Constructors in one
> uh like blueprint the idea isn't that
> you're gonna be able to do that with
> every building you're still gonna have
> to like to figure out how to make sense
> of like the different modules and fit
> them in the way that you want them
> um but you're still gonna be able to
> like you know set up a manufacturer and
> set up like all the the belts leading
> into it so you know if you have a setup
> where you have a manifold going into
> several manufacturers you can still set
> it up so that the movement makes sense
> for you in your build so that you can
> create that manifold really quickly uh
> because a lot of the tedious stuff in
> our game really is like place in the
> building hooking it up setting the
> recipe you know a lot of that stuff is
> kind of managed when you put it in a
> blueprint
> um and I think a lot of the TDM comes
> from the belt work yeah it's a logistics
> setup especially for a building like
> this it's just such a hassle to set this
> up in a clean way yeah and once you
> figure out a nice way of doing it
> it's just really nice to be able to copy
> paste yeah and it's even like the case
> where maybe you want to do uh you know
> you do all the belt work in one
> blueprint and then you do the machines
> and another one and then when you're
> placing them down you first do the
> blueprint with the the belt work and
> then or the other way around
> um so so like there's a lot of puzzling
> happening that I I think a lot of people
> might not uh you know understand quite
> yet but it is it is quite flexible still
> even though you can put down you know a
> huge factor with one click
> yeah stacking Splitters is another one
> you know getting the direction going in
> the right way
> um just having a blueprint that's just
> like a stack of Splitters I think I mean
> and because you can set all the uh
> recipes beforehand too yeah and uh set
> up the
> overclocking yeah yeah which is nice so
> it can save you some little steps that
> you have to do how did we arrive at 4x4
> we did a bunch of tests with like early
> game setups so the main thing that we
> kind of wanted out of it at least uh
> from our earlier talks was that we want
> these kind of arrangements to be fitting
> in it of course so like logistic
> Solutions and stuff like that but also
> like early game setups like smaller
> setups and we just did a bunch of test
> cases with like uh reinforced iron
> plates but also just cable and tried
> some aluminum setups and we kind of just
> landed on this one being the nicest one
> that still had a good restriction space
> like three by three is just too small
> because also if we wanted to be a box
> which is kind of what we want to do with
> it uh when we started looking at this uh
> then if you do free by free it's just
> too short
> but uh it also causes a lot of issues
> very quickly for Constructors already
> for example yeah but four by four felt
> like a good size but you can actually
> still put a lot of stuff in it but you
> kind of have to start splitting up
> things once your production line is
> getting bigger uh and this is actually
> the thing that we like about it where we
> do want people to segment this and find
> the solutions that work for these
> different kind of setups but of course
> we're still testing this I mean we're
> kind of set on this size for now but if
> there's a lot of people that are having
> issues with it or want different kinds
> of sizes
> they should just let us know yeah we
> will look into it but most importantly
> what we want to know is just how how
> they play yeah
> and see how it affects because this is
> like it actually is gonna be a game
> changer in some ways where
> the way I mean it's not maybe not well
> kind of like pipes with like it kind of
> changes how the game plays out sort of
> the same way here I think because uh I
> think because I'm really curious how
> like creative builds are gonna look
> in the coming weeks like if we're going
> to see a lot of like similar builds or
> if things are going to be more boxy in
> the future
> um I'm really curious about that stuff
> too
> um but I think that a lot of people that
> don't like that don't want that look or
> that QB look like they're still going to
> be building the same way they have
> before
> um it just adds like a layer on top of
> that sort of
> so it'll be interesting to see
> uh we'll be blueprint designer Mark II
> no nothing like that planned at the
> moment
> do you know when the updates against EA
> that's a good question
> um usually it takes like a couple of
> weeks uh we are kind of shooting for
> early December right now
> and uh
> uh we we kind of want to get it out as
> soon as possible We're not gonna be able
> to finish it before fixmest kicks off
> fixmest kicks off
> on the first of December
> and uh but we won't be done by then I
> think but we are shooting for like early
> December
> uh hopefully on EA but it kind of
> depends on on all the bugs that you guys
> find and if you find in the books go to
> the QSI questions.satisfacturing.com
> uh do you say first or third uh first of
> December for fixmas
> or holiday event that happens every year
> do we have anything new to share no
> we have nothing new unless there's like
> someone's made something secretly yeah
> but we haven't planned for anything new
> production-wise I don't really have an
> up you know update going yeah it really
> is like yeah
> it's it do be like it is but um I was
> gonna say uh it's gonna be like a rerun
> of last year so it's gonna be like it's
> there's nothing new but there's you know
> the same stuff content last year so if
> you haven't played fixmest before you're
> gonna get a whole bunch of new stuff
> coming
> um and it will run from December to like
> you know mid-January stuff like that I
> think it did last year as well
> uh
> um and hopefully we will have fixed up
> the calendar before then because I think
> the calendar needs to be updated did it
> break no but it might there might be
> something it's like one of the calendars
> like you get a post or something like
> that yeah yeah yeah yeah we know we have
> to do like a run through of it yeah
> before we ship it out again but it will
> just be you know the same yeah same as
> last year
> DNA coupons yes let's open the passion
> tracker before I forget something
> because we only have a couple of minutes
> left on the stream uh we talked about
> overclocking we have shown really
> quickly creature mode uh I'm gonna show
> it off again for those who don't know
> there's this Advanced game settings now
> and uh this could probably gonna be more
> game modes in the future but for now you
> can go to creature you can set the
> auxiliary uh
> uh setting
> default okay creatures will attack
> players on site oh we did add this cool
> I didn't think we're gonna maybe able to
> do this retaliate so I think this is the
> if you're in if there's like another
> mode here where if you attack the
> creatures they start attacking oh wait
> I'm not showing on the Stream
> foreign
> looking like a maniac
> um so in in the options menu there's
> Advanced game settings and now there's a
> creature setting here and this creature
> hostility
> and the default is the way it looks in
> the game there's also passive where
> creatures don't attack you at all even
> if you attack them well they run away
> depends on the creature the way that I
> don't have any weapons it's uh stress
> yeah and there's also a retaliate mode
> where if you attack them they will
> attack you but they won't like they
> won't initiate the attack uh I think
> still the the Spore flowers they will
> still
> like open up and gas you yeah yeah
> they're not considered creatures right
> how so uh let's just got demoted yeah
> yeah they're not creatures uh no but the
> Spore flowers will still open up and you
> know gas pillars will still hurt you uh
> but the creatures that roam around on
> the in the on the map they will uh chill
> out we'll chill out
> um so I think that's pretty cool and you
> can set that in game is there a setting
> for that in the main menu as well or is
> it just in game uh do you know uh
> a good question actually I don't think
> we have it in it yeah also we haven't
> updated the menu for this update uh
> because time uh we might change it for
> EA but no promises it might be the same
> I know we've always updated this sad
> yeah that'd be a little sad yeah I would
> look forward to that because then it
> comes in and I'm like oh look at that
> yeah uh so maybe for EA but uh for this
> release we didn't have time for it I can
> make it if you want it'll look great
> there's another one of the old scenes so
> you just select the blueprint designer
> just put it around everything actually
> that's thank you but then you can't see
> it look at this beauty
> oh it's so good looking I love the
> ladder over here too it adds to it just
> a letter poke it goes through that yeah
> you want to show it
> um
> the resourcing Edition yeah yeah so uh
> awesome sink
> um so we changed uh this was actually
> gonna come in update six originally but
> we didn't have time to add it for update
> six uh so there's like new two tracks
> now
> uh
> uh I should have I wish I had weapons oh
> I do have weapons I'm gonna go kill that
> thing and go find your body or my body
> it doesn't show up on the
> I think it might just be like one of
> those are disabled actually that might
> be a compass it might be a thing where
> yeah we don't show offline players uh if
> you go towards the big waterfall but
> also be creatures there yeah let's do
> that
> uh we've changed to that like there's
> new two uh two tracks of of uh coupon
> points now so when you're making DNA
> capsules which we also change the name
> of him apparently uh they used to be
> called they were always called this sure
> uh
> they they serve a separate purpose now
> instead of just being part of like
> unlocking stuff in the map they also
> give you separate coupon points rewards
> thingies
> so uh it's it's like good because like
> if you already have a lot of coupons and
> and and you want to get more
> uh it will still be effective let's see
> what happens here
> come back here
> easy see money you're a real tough guy
> now aren't you where did you where'd you
> put the thing uh to the right to the
> right to the right
> it's a snail over there
> then across the river somewhere
> across the road again there we go
> we're gonna add robots to the game
> the row boats don't give them ideas dude
> why don't we get pizza to the game
> when are we getting pizza at the office
> that's a bigger question yeah
> in an hour
> get that we're gonna have a big
> pizza party now you're right here now
> okay left sorry
> do that
> your other lift it's okay good thing no
> one was watching
> it's probably just a couple of I
> actually don't know how many pizza for
> everyone yeah yeah just show up at the
> office uh wait where somewhere around
> here I think
> oh let's see yeah get on top of this
> dude
> get a good vantage point
> I was killed that guy don't kill that
> guy all right
> it's really easy yeah it's really not
> very hard is it
> oh it attack me wait maybe did you turn
> on retaliate yeah I think I did
> I sure hope you did yeah
> I should have cut the stream I'd be like
> yeah yeah I totally did yeah yeah yeah
> yeah yeah
> [Music]
> where's this body
> I think it was more to you right now
> more on the dunes still he's just put in
> like a wild goose chase I think I can
> craft the cup I'm not sure if it's there
> though it's so weird as well because she
> just got my safe so you should have just
> no I think it is I think it's because
> I'm oh because it's a different it's a
> different session idea so um yeah man uh
> and uh since it's staging build I can't
> whoops I switched I can't to use the
> yellow any possess thing
> um so anyways so yeah let's make some
> hot protein let's make some splitter
> protein
> and then DNA okay so I wish now I kind
> of want to go back now because I want to
> put uh the other stuff in the awesome
> sink as well but I can show it off here
> and then kill myself and uh go back
> there uh
> awesome sync and then we'll hook up to
> that totally there's a power source
> there don't worry about it uh so yeah
> now you can put uhmj
> storage container
> all right
> think of a jig there we go I'm gonna put
> the DNA capsules in there actually I
> could put the other stuff here too so we
> can just show off real quick
> um
> this one updates every minute right it
> doesn't show like immediately
> like the curves I think here
> so so each DNA capsule is worth a
> thousand points
> and then uh it ramps up like the more
> points you need for each level to
> generate a coupon but just from killing
> those animals I already got three
> coupons
> uh which is pretty sweet actually
> uh
> with that I can buy stuff
> very useful things such as beans
> and stuff so you can see here like
> compared to like the the low level stuff
> you get a lot of points for the DNA
> coupons
> um it Rams up pretty quickly so the idea
> is that you can get some early coupons
> pretty quickly yeah from some stuff you
> have left it's also of course is still
> the case that you need them for research
> like the alien remains so there's a bit
> of a thing like do I want to do the
> research do I want to get some coupons
> yeah but it's mainly just a way to yeah
> you saw a lot of players just leave of
> course the loot behind because that's no
> real purpose yeah after the early game
> so we figured why not just let them get
> some coupons this way so the players
> that like exploration maybe a bit more
> than others can get some coupons that
> way so if you have smaller Factory you
> can still just get all the Cosmetics you
> want
> or if you're that friend in the in the
> play party that there's always a factory
> building it just wants to run around you
> can still contribute a lot yeah if
> you're that person in the party that's
> like I'll get car drives then like this
> is for you okay that's my that's what I
> do every time we have our PlayStations
> now because I'm like I'm going up hard
> drive hunting
> wait
> oh is this still the alpha hog sound or
> is it the this sounds like that yeah
> yeah uh we're gonna change because like
> right now all the Hogs do the alpha hogs
> sound we're gonna
> we're gonna change that up
> cool
> what else it's in the update
> um let's check the patch notes the patch
> not should be on Reddit and on our
> Discord and stuff like that
> I'm actually gonna double check that
> real quick
> it worked to his job
> um
> 240 water for
> nuclear power plant yeah 244 for nuclear
> power plant that's pretty sweet so we
> made a decision there to go 240. that we
> said it was like we were probably gonna
> do 240 but we actually decided to do
> 240. yeah I mean that's the maximum
> number yeah but it's also the one that I
> think lines up best for the one that the
> ratios line up in the pipe amounts yeah
> yeah that made sense um so if you
> already have any power setups at the
> moment like the only downside right now
> is that you'll be feeding too much water
> like your power production will still
> work
> right yeah
> um and like the easy solution right now
> is just down clock your uh your under
> clock your your fuel
> extract water extractors there you go
> God damn it I need to get there I
> believe in you yeah yeah yeah
> um and that way you'll get 100
> efficiency again if you if you care
> about that stuff uh which I know a lot
> of people do
> yes uh I think that's most like like we
> said this is this is a small update like
> I know people are like oh blueprints
> they lied it's not a small
> update it is a small update like I think
> it's like blueprints and then yeah and
> that's it a couple of other things but
> um
> I know that blueprints are is like a
> huge game changer for a lot of people
> and and uh it is it is in a lot of other
> people's eyes it is a big change and I
> guess it is so it's like uh it's you
> know let's meet halfway it's like a big
> small medium it's medium sized
> um you know standard update like in
> terms of like patch notes like content
> lists it's not a lot going on but like
> the features themselves are pretty beefy
> um and uh I think I think a lot of
> people are getting a lot of out of this
> update as well uh so depending on what
> kind of play style you had because I
> think you gotta we're kind of like going
> for each place that player like
> archetype right now because update ticks
> were all about exploration and like the
> people that really care about
> exploration got something out of that
> and now we're going to watch like the
> forward you know the hardcore like
> Factory building people that like really
> care about like setting up complex stuff
> and now they're getting something
> um so uh
> we're getting there zip line yeah zip
> line is a little tricky to show off uh
> at the moment we're gonna do more with
> that uh where's the Goddamn thing oh I'm
> still on that scene
> um
> because one tricky thing with zip lines
> at the moment is like you can only go
>  you can only go so far
> I actually need to make the zipline do I
> have the materials for that
> I'm sure that I think you do you need to
> ethereum yeah I don't think I can show
> it off unfortunately but um but even if
> I had the zip line it would be kind of
> tricky to show it off because I've got
> the components by just building
> something and dismantling I could but uh
> see here what do you need for the zip
> line
> uh uh I need to go to the store I
> usually have this bound
> that's why I'm like looking forward so
> much
> there we go
> uh zip line we need
> a zapper which we have quick wire
> iron Rod evil what makes what building
> needs quick wire it's like
> the um it's the power switch no
> uh fuel generator
> I swear there was like some the fuel
> generator needs it yeah
> give me that I probably need a lot
> though
> yeah I didn't know yeah
> yeah
> and iron rod
> could possibly this is such a weird way
> to do this but uh this is how we wear it
> is on the dev Bill sometimes and then
> cable didn't I get cable from this bad
> boy
> then we do this oh sorry if we do
> this
> don't tell me wow
> we get more wire
> that bug has been in the game forever
> what oh maybe we fixed that bug actually
> because I just think it's so consuming
> from the inventory when you build with
> it though
> yeah uh Constructor
> needed 30. shitload of things yeah
> why does your Zep bring your ass wait oh
> it's my hand
> there we go we got there in the end dude
> MLG decide you play Satisfaction yes
> sure uh so like the problem with
> um
> with a little bit of problem with the
> zip line is like you kind of need to
> um keep jumping between pull from Pole
> um so it is a little bit tricky to
> generate enough speed and you kind of
> need to go far because we don't generate
> like a ton of speed when you when you
> sprint it kind of builds up over time
> uh in the video fun fact it's actually
> hooked up a hypertube cannon right next
> to the the the the the wire
> so I shot myself out of the hyperdoodle
> cannon
> uh and then attached to uh the wireless
> no but you still maintain the speed so I
> just I just skipped that part uh
> but essentially when you hold uh Sprints
> and it's possible we might add some like
> VFX to this as well to show like you are
> sprinting
> um
> but you do build up like a ton of more
