### Transcript

> um so let's talk a little bit about what you're working on yeah it's a very very requested feature this guy is working on dedicated search right now or not right now but like in general well right generally it's been going okay with the detective servers we have got gotten the in-game patch up and we have uh or some of the in-game parts so loading and saving that stuff kind of works now so you can actually from an ingame as a client load and save and then we we have a server up and running and the basics of it running but we do not have all the features that like community how do i connect to my friend how do i find my friend because we have new server browser right now because we only play play by friends so that's currently how we we what we're trying to figure out how to do all these kind of things and also find all the crashes and get it up and running on windows and when we have windows running we're gonna try to see if it's a possibility for other platforms and if we have time for that yeah yeah that's really cool if we can pretty much do that yeah um so like so you mentioned that like admin yeah yeah stuff is there anything else that you felt like no it's like do we notice stuff that's like oh we need to do this as well mostly that dgy is not made for for it and so just now and the ui has been really really busy lately so it's just been me ad hocking in the gui right now so there's a couple of fine program arch in there and there's also a lot of just trying to get the current ui to work on dedicated servers because we almost always assume that there is a player on the server right and right now there will be new players on the server and that might that has caused a few issues here and there but i think you cleaned up a lot of that math before hopefully
