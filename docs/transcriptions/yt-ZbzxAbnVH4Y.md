> yes did your studio ever think about joining green game jen maybe one uh on uh or one day once 1.0 is out uh we we've done some game gyms in the past i you know i think it's possible that we might end up either just joining a game jam or just having our own game jam like we've done it before it's possible that we may do it again we actually have a video of one of those game gems where instead of me being part of the game jam making the game i made a video of the game jam while everyone was making the game jam um it's like really old though it's kind of weird that's like 2018 three years ago a lot of i'll link it here we go yeah yeah yeah that's a weird video but yeah but if the question is just like if we joined any game yet like there's been people doing like global game jam and stuff like that uh outside the office times yeah i guess i guess i was thinking like as an entire studio yeah we have done that in the past yeah i think that's that's what the question was about too
