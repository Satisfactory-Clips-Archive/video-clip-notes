> I feel like I feel like I don't know if I want this to be effective for yeah it was a float floor okay so that was right yeah okay this is interesting because now I don't know why it's not picking up that it's blind for him supply and prime what did I miss man I haven't done shaders in a long time oh yeah this is it's like going back to the the trenches I kind of miss doing opengl to be honest really because then you knew what you were sending to that's true there's there's a huge obfuscation layer here that's, currently biting me and my my biter you also don't have to relearn everything if you want to do material stuff because I still think sometimes it's easier to just write shader code than just like figuring out how to make them in blueprint so I wish unreal engine had a better like it was easier to do your own custom run like kind of like like unity does it yeah but then also I remember that I don't know if it's gotten better but it's like well they also have a material graph now though too right but it's like I need this to scroll I have to write a shader for this yeah yeah it's honestly so much better that was that was a while ago too though well I feel like we should I tried the the shader tools in unity and, I mean they're getting there but it's still so long you can only really do basic stuff so far
