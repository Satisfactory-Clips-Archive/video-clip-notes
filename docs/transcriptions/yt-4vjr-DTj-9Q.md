> someone else what happens if trains hit derailed trains they don't yeah they can't I think yeah I'm not sure if they I can't remember because I remember there being a I remember someone saying yeah they derail and then someone's saying they don't derail and so I don't actually know right now yeah because they switch I know for a fact that they switch physics bodies and I think the trains use like special collision, channels for the when they're on the tracks, so- I personally don't think they are affected by it but I'm not 100 sure I think what happens is that the train runs into the one like if there's a train lying on the track or something I think it will just push it away in those cases it will only derail if it's hitting another re-rail train you know what I mean yeah but yeah that's a guess on my part I'm not one of them you guys are going to find out when you yeah yeah that's that's the thing like a lot of these questions like yeah you like you just experiment and you'll figure it out yourselves, don't mind answering some now if we can of course
