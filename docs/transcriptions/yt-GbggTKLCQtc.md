### Transcript

> I think there's gonna be like some minor stuff, coming to the game in general before update four, and I don't like that might be quality of life stuff that might be you know something new I don't know, but I don't know we we're gonna try and be as transparent as we can about this and be as transparent as we can about like what we expect to be coming, because there are a lot of cool stuff I think that's gonna be coming, but right now we're really only working on maintaining the systems that we have and like building up systems so that we can you know in the future implement much cooler stuff, so yeah that is that is I think a summary a tldr is that we're still working on stuff, and, so hopefully soon we can talk more about what actually is coming
