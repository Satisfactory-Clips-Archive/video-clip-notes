> Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the studio. It is fantastic to have you here. Hi, my name is Jace, I'm a programmer and the community manager here at Coffee Stain Studios. Today's video is going to be all about the Alpha,
all the information, and I know I kind of troll you guys a lot
with all my videos and social media posts, but today's information
is going to be a 100% true, I swear you're not gonna believe me anyway,
but you know, I'm kind of taking this a little bit seriously. But we don't need my life story.
Let's get on with the good stuff! How many people will be selected for the Alpha? So in the very beginning we're only gonna be accepting 200 people. That's not a lot of people, but we're going to be increasing that very very quickly. The reason we're taking just
200 people in the very beginning is we just want to make sure
all of our systems are in place, dispatching keys are in place, gathering feedback,
all that stuff is working fine and as soon as it is we're just gonna bring more people in after that, and hopefully that won't take too long so we can get more people in as soon as possible,
 and you know, on the flip side of that is
if everything goes to shit it may even be that we have to stop the Alpha,
put out some fires and then restart it later. We really just have to react to what's going on, because we have no idea really
what's gonna happen, and also as mentioned in a previous,
I think it was a Q&amp;A, the Alpha will actually be in stages, and one of the things about the stages is
as those stages progress we're going to be taking more people in as well. So if you didn't get in at the beginning, you may get in
at one of those extra stages, too. But what if I still don't get an alpha key?

> How long will the Alpha last? It really kind of depends, the feedback
we get is really gonna dictate how the Alpha really is gonna run.
We're going to be very reactive. So answering this question is kind of hard. What is this election process gonna be like? All the people who signed up for the newsletter
at satisfactorygame.com will receive a survey sent
to the email that signed up with, we will collect the results from all the surveys and then we'll pick people
who will get an Alpha key. We're taking a variety of people. We're gonna be categorizing them into different buckets, so there's no real way to game the system. You can say that you have
the best computer in the universe, and you've played a million hours
of other games like Satisfactory, that's not gonna give you a
better chance of getting in, because we want a wide range of people. So please just be honest, if you lie it just means we're not going to be getting the sample of people that we want and
we won't be able to make the game better. So please be honest. People who are selected are gonna get an email
sent to them with all the information they need to join the Alpha. Will the Alpha be single-player or multiplayer? We did previously say that
there would be multiplayer in the Alpha and it's still will, but in the beginning we're just
going to be focusing on single-player and the first hour of gameplay and
making that a solid experience. I mean, we just specifically want feedback for that. Of course, you can play the game beyond that, as long as you like and it's still very fun, but we're really really off to that feedback of the first hour of gameplay. Multi-player introduces a lot of bugs 
and crashes and whatnot, and that will probably just
distract us from the feedback we really really need in the beginning. So that's you know, so we're cutting it out. However, we will introduce multiplayer later. We really do need to test it and make sure it's stable, make sure the gameplay is fun
when you're playing with friends, so that will come, just a little later. And we're not trying to hide the fact that
we don't have multiplayer, we do, it's just really about single-player
feedback at this point. Will all the tech be available in the Alpha? Not all the tech will be available, it'll be the early and mid-game tech only, we're hiding away the late game stuff
so that you can see it a little later. And also we want to see, you know, how the gameplay works,
from transition from early to mid-game. The stages of the Alpha will also
focus on starting points, that doesn't mean the map is not cut off but we really want to start you in one area, and see how do they play there, and how does the game develop
in that starting area, and then move you to a different one,
and then move you to a different one. But if you want to go for a walk to
the other side of the map and start there, you can do that. Will there be an NDA? There will be an NDA but it'll be a soft NDA, and what that means is we just request 
that you do not share anything online, any information, any screenshots, any footage, don't stream anything, and the reason for that is the game
is just not done yet. We would prefer to work with you improve the game and then show the game off to everyone a little later on. When this changes, when the NDA changes,
we're gonna make that publicly available we're gonna tell everyone, so hopefully, please keep it under wraps and
then we can show the world later. Will the game be localized into other languages? We plan on using community-driven translations
so that, you know, you guys can just help out with any translations
that we want into any language. But we will not have it at the very beginning, We're really hoping to add it into the Alpha,
at one of those stages because we know that we have a lot of different communities in non-english speaking locations in the world, so we would like to provide the game
in their language. We actually planned to have it in the Alpha
from the beginning but Simon happened I guess, and that's all the time we have today.
So thank you very... REALEASE DATE!! Oh, yeah, the release date. The Alpha will begin on Wednesday the 17th of October,
so that's in two weeks. However, of course the usual disclaimer: literally anything can happen to push it back We really don't think that's gonna happen. 
We're pretty confident and set on that date, but hopefully, nothing unexpected
 happens to push it back, but I think we're good. And then because of the release, we're not gonna be releasing any 
Wednesday content next week, so that I can just focus on programming 
to help the team out and we're not going to release any
Wednesday content the week after because that will be the Alpha,
that's kind of went at Wednesday content. As for the full release date of the game, 
we have no idea, it really depends on what kind of feedback we get, and
what we need to make the game better. It's a really big game with many moving parts
and we're pretty small team. So I think it's, to some degree, we must work with the community
to make the game better. So it may be in some kind of like
early accessy kind of state for some time, and yeah, we'll work with you guys
to make it better. And that's all the information
we have about the Alpha, if you have any questions or concerns leave them in the comments below
and we'll be checking them out. We can't respond to everything everyone says, but we do pretty much read everything 
across all of our social medias. One little note I want to just let you guys know is that we have it allowed or enabled rather community translated content and closed captions on YouTube, so if you want to contribute to closed captions
or translations into your own language please help us out by maybe even
translating this video so that our non-english speaking folks can get
all this Alpha information as well. If you don't already, be sure to follow us
 on Twitter, on Facebook, join our Reddit, join our Discord,
we're on Instagram as well. All the links will be in the description down below and every comment, every subscription,
every retweet, every person who joins Discord gives me 30 Slayer experience in Runescape, and I really need that help because I need  93 Slayer for my western provinces elite diary. It's the only one I have left and
Slayer sucks and it takes so long All right, bye! Release date RELEASE DATE! Jesus fuc*ing Christ! Don't forget to sigh The Youtube sigh
