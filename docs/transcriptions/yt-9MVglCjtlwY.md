### Transcript

> yeah what are what are plans what are plans for trains i don't know um what i have so far uh i mean because okay let me rephrase the question a bit because the thing that i get a lot is people are asking us if we're going to introduce like a signaling system or like a collision system for trains or something like that do you have any idea like what you prefer or i was talking to g2 about that recently and he's our lead programmer and i think he worked a lot on the trains but he's especially i mean he's kind of more into the train system than i am definitely and i think he also just knows more about the requirements for it than i do at this point i have to look more into it but we talked recently about us definitely needing the the signaling he really wants to make that and it is on the list and i don't see why we wouldn't add it if he thinks that it's possible and it seems that a lot of players want it right so i think we should do it but yeah it's just again a matter of priority is it more important than something something new or another feature that is maybe kind of in need of some additions right um and that's and just something to consider there as well is like we're a really small team we're like 30 people only right so it's like it's it's hard to to dedicate our time to so many like a lot of people have so many uh requests um and everyone and a lot of folks think that their request is super important and i'm not saying they're bad requests but uh we can't do it all you know it takes a lot of time
