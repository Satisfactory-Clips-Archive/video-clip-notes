### Transcript

> Tired of building one foundation
block at a time? I know I am. Then just switch build modes and Zooooop! Zooping will make building much faster
as you're now able to place up to ten build pieces
at a time. Zooping isn't available
for manufacturing buildings, but you can use it for foundations
and most of the cosmetic build pieces by just dragging them out either
horizontally or vertically.
