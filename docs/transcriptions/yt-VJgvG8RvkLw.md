### Transcript

> what's the feature you wanna add to this so I personally really wanna improve the build modes, I there are there are a lot I think we talked about this last week as well there are a few, there are a few things that really annoy me when you're building and I think there are somewhat easy to fix and they will improve building immensely so I would love to to improve some of those things first and foremost and maybe like a global grid situation but also like how you place you know, mergers and splitters I think that's one of the like places mergers and splitters, not the fact that they don't clip on foundations when you're dragging them I'm already placed, conveyor belts and stuff like that I think that's really annoying, stuff like you know the what are they called the the pipe connector thingies I can't remember what they're called that they rotate too I think they rotate too freely I want them to be able to clip snap it a bit better the snapping system we have for the guidelines thing when the green lines show up when you hold control that's a prototype that's not done at all, that's a prototype I made and then we're like alright I just put in the game whatever it works pipe junction thank you, I want I want better clipping and like snapping with that so if you're if you're one of those people that like builds very methodically it just makes it so much easier to build because I think the addition of the the hover pack makes things so much better in the game I think the hover pack is like one of the best items in the game right now, so improving the the build modes would make the game a ton better imo god I love the hover pack I know it's so good right
