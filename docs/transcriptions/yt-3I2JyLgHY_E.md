> can you make gas mask filters last longer than three seconds each yo i'm pretty sure they last longer than that don't they this is by the way a big part of my work or like a big part of my job when people ask me i just go to the wiki uh yeah one filter lasts 45 seconds so if they only last three seconds that's a book depends on the amount of gas i'm pretty sure we fixed that bug there was a bug where if you're if you're close to more than one gas pillar it would deplete it faster that bug is fixed so if it depends on gas then that bug is back because i'm pretty sure the rate of consumption of the gas is is going to be is supposed to be linear if 45 seconds feel like three seconds you might be high as to be fair though the nights in satisfactory are five minutes and it feels like a decade so time is relevant i guess do some testing nice if if uh if you find that that's not the case merkin please uh add that to your site at the kuchwa tag at the gui site yeah time is relevant bug i'll be back i'll be back did i say relevant did i say time is relevant oh my brain i think i said it twice amazing
