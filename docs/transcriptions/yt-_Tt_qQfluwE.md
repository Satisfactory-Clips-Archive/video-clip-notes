> the four-way pipes snap to guidelines when placing vertically now you mean so I found out about this today if you if you drag a pipe like from from top to bottom right so it's a vertical pipe, if you use a a what do you call it the the like pipe regular pipe holder thingy at the edge of one of the pipes they will snap to that, I think unless it would snap into something else but like I actually got it to snap because I was quite frustrated with that that I couldn't get that to work and then I had one of the the conveyor, support thingies what are they called convey your whole conveyor support whatever poll the poll thing conveyor pipe hole pull pull whatever like if you have one placed in the level where you want it to snap to then it works pipe wall support not the not the wall support the regular one the one that like if you place on a foundation it will make One automatically of course nude conveyor pole dance not the floor hole no not the hall God damn it you guys just you guys are just mean right now since I focus on holes no you guys are the ones are they just pipe support because the pipe support are the ones that get stuck on the walls and stuff right there might just be the pipeline yeah anyways if you have one aligned with the pipes that are vertical and you drag the, the splitter then it works at least in this situation I tried this today so- I actually deleted like a whole line of vertical it's an output hole isn't it it's not an output well it technically is but it's a snapping point stop saying hold now you stop saying well you know you hang up

> so yeah but, it would be nice if they snap to each other if you place a pipe splitter they're not called pipes loaders they call something else right you place one on an on a pipe and you have another pipe next to it that's vertical it would be nice if that snap to that that's my that's my take that's my hot take right there and I'll stick into it that would be Dandy
