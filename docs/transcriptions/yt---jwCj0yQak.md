### Transcript

> I saw a question, so g4 is now on experimental so I haven't fully understood how geforce now works in this regard, here's what I here's what I know okay which isn't much but if you're using geforce now and you want to play the game, if you own the game on epic game store right now it's possible to use both the experimental and the regular version of satisfactory mostly because, epic doesn't have the thing where you can switch on the same game, so so in your library it will show up as two different separate games right whereas on steam it's it's one game where you have different branches right so that means that in geforce now I believe you can you can decide that you want to install the experimental version of the game as far as I know I might be wrong on this but that's the case and on steam I don't think it's possible but I also think some people have managed to do it so if you own the game on steam I think it's doable but I'm not undermining sure I don't quite I don't you know this is this this newfangled technology stuff geforce now and streaming games like I'm a boomer okay I don't unders I don't know all these intricacies, so if somebody knows a way to to play the experimental version if you own it on steam in geforce now, please share that information because that that sounds like, that sounds juicy but yeah sadly people, aren't able to, I've got both and just lets you open on steam or epic oh okay bummer yeah maybe we should reach I don't know if we should reach out to geforce now and see if there's a solution we can do or something because it is a bit of a bummer that a lot of people can't play the game on geforce now when it is in experimental especially when it's like exclusively you know it's been out for so long experimental anyways, yeah so that I guess that's it- I don't know- I felt like I had a point with this but I don't think I do I think it's just like I don't know I'm I'm too old for this geforce now is too too too cool for me to understand, so yeah
