> the addition of blueprints I also have a little bit of an update on overclocking one of the reasons why we've gone back and forth so much with overclocking is because the addition of blueprints kind of shifts the trade-off for overclocking we were originally going to change so that like overclocking was going to be completely linear because we figured that blueprints would make overclocking kind of redundant count how many times is that overclocking but one thing we realized is that blueprints might actually increase the value of space which to this point has been like the only real trade-off is that you need more space because you need to build more so the current thinking is that overclocking might become more valid which sort of changes the whole trade-off discussion again currently though we're leaning towards not making overclocking linear but changing the exponent so it makes it like significantly lower if you don't know what I'm talking about I'll leave a link to the wiki article explaining all about this stuff with the overclocking so you can see like the mathematical formula and like what the exponent is currently and how that will affect the overclocking formula so so overclocking will be cheaper in Update 7 and underclocking will give a little bit less savings there but this will still be a test case linear is not out of the window yet we still need a bit more data on the final decision but first we want to try it out and sort of get your feedback on this and see if blueprints actually impact overclocking the way we think it will lastly I want to leave you
