> markers are your like, replacement for beacons right they have the same functionality the stamps are more for when you're out exploring and you like see things in the distance or, you want to make like mental notes of certain things you know the way we kind of envision it when you're running around in the environment is that you're running around you see things that you want to mark out like oh there's a cool cave or like is it there's a slug in the distance that I can't pick up right now, that's another thing total actually made a point of this and I want to address that, like why would you place a beacon next to a slug because you already you're going to pick it up regardless but there's a lot of cases where maybe you're running around and you haven't got the jet pack and you see like a slug in the distance and you're like I want to pick that up but I don't want to forget it so that's what you use marks for, stamps for you stamp the slug so you know like okay I can get that later, and there's probably a bunch of view cases that we don't think about there's probably going to be some emergent use cases for stamps I've seen a lot of people be like yeah I like to mark you know where, enemies respawn and stuff like that so I think that's that's more so what we think those will be used for and in those cases even though you have those abilities to like mark them in the the like in the compass and stuff like that they still take up like a quite significant part in the in the on the map so like just having a stamp felt better overall so that's why that that feature was added and that wasn't really to like replace well to a certain stand but it's also like if you die you know in the world, you lose your stuff you lose your beacons that you have in your inventory whereas now if you die you'll still have those stamps on the in the environment so you still can't like trace your breadcrumbs and you know you don't lose progress the exploration that you did did not go like in vain and that's kind of what we envisioned stamps to be used for stamps do not take inventory no so you can you can just place them wherever, so long as you don't go over the budget of stamps you know so so that's the like idea,
