> but adding the ability to build a cover on belts that you could build onto finished factories belt, belts help performance, people have asked this since since like day one actually, and I think I think it might it like maybe in some cases but, I actually think that yeah I'm not sure it's something that we've not wanted to do and part of me wants to say and I don't know if this is correct or not but part of me wants to say that like the rendering of the items on the belts is not really necessarily the bottleneck I think because we've done some really clever stuff with the way that we instance the items on belts so we actually draw them in very very few draw calls and stuff and so like if I if I remember that correctly, and that like a lot of the bottlenecks come elsewhere from like other buildings or from calculating things in the background like the game, the game itself is actually as far as again as far as I know as of now it is CPU bound so it's it's, it's it's more like all the calculations that happen for like what's going on in your factory is what holds things back more often than not, yeah
