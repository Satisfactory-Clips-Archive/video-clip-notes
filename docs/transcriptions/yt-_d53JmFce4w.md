> well this is pretty good middleware it is good it is good like we we it's very use it's been very good for us it's just that it's it's uh it's a little bit of extra work with it um we've had issues like hooking it up basically to the engine for a long time it's always been uh yeah it would sometimes it would be the only reason why we couldn't upgrade the engine yeah because because like they just haven't like upgraded their support or something and for update four there were also a bunch of issues where for some people the the game would just like crash without getting us a a crash report which is terrible for us because there's no way for us to figure out what's wrong in those cases like the only way for us to figure out is to like actually go to the person and install like a dev environment on their computer so we can debug it uh when it happens because it's it's like it was it was somehow tied with like a windows version we realized but we found out that the issue was with v-wise uh and uh eventually we managed to plug most of the issues i think there might be like very rare occurrences of it still happening but hopefully once we like actually move over fully to the vanilla version that will squash that issue
