### Transcript

> just kidding uh we're wondering if multiplayer desync etc uh specifically with trains is being looked into um yeah i mean it's it's a known issue people have told us a lot about issues with trains or vehicles or whatever all multiplayer all the entire game uh all those issues are looked into we're a pretty small team so we can't look at every issue or even like like not even like relatively not even a lot of issues at the same time so like we're pretty slow guys but but we we do see it we do know and we're gonna we're gonna work on it we're gonna get around to it we take it in steps because uh all those type of issues they're not like connected to one like there's not one root issue too like they're all different problems um and specifically for the d-sync stuff we're going to start with player movement i believe we're working on that currently and once that works properly then we're going to move over to like hyper tubes or blah blah and i think the vehicles are going to be last unfortunately because we might want to change um much with the vehicle system specifically for trains because trains are kind of half implemented or like not have to implement but like we want to introduce like train signals or collision and stuff like that and we'd rather do those fixes while we're implementing that otherwise we're going to fix trains and then we're going to break them again and then we have to fix them again so yeah that is one of the things when it comes to optimizing optimization things or even just like massive refactoring and things like that like like when it comes to optimization a lot of that stuff when it um when trying to optimize things it a lot of the steps usually works around the fact that you can assume things are specifically the way they are and then you can make changes where you start only accounting for specific behaviors as opposed to any general behavior and in doing that too early means if something changes because of community suggestions or design changes whatever then you need to break everything all over again because all of your assumptions are not correct and your system doesn't work with it at all and now this one thing where you just want to i don't know like add another slot or something like that for some reason is really hard now right um so that's a weird thing that can happen so like when it comes to optimization some stuff just has to be left and that's the same for game design decisions because it's a bit of a fallacy because like we leave it broken just because we want to be open to be able to like redo it or change a big part of it or you know like the the the equipment slot for instance that's that's i mean it's it's not hard for us to to fix that or change that it's just that we want to rework that whole thing and we'd rather do it then instead of just slapping on a fix now and then have to redo it again um it's broken on purpose guys trust me yeah let's just say that yeah so like that kind of stuff is obviously frustrating now but the the vision for us is long term the vision is 1.0 like is is having a is releasing a good game uh and so that means we have to sacrifice things in the in the moment in the now and that generally just affects the folks who are playing now so it's already sorry but yeah yeah and it ain't cool but uh intentionally impaired indeed
