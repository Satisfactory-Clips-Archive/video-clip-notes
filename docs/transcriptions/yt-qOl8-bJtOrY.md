> is there a possibility to get first-person cameras and vehicles for me the third person always kills the immersion, possibly I think there's a chance the thing is Vehicles will probably get reworked, at least under the hood I don't know if their functionality in game will change but they're likely going to get some work done to them and I think generally what we do is we try and if we're going to rework something then we just we save all the work for it until we dive into it so I since we have plans to rework vehicles I doubt we're going to do anything even with the camera if we do it at all, but I doubt we'd do anything with the camera until we dedicate time to the vehicles as a whole
