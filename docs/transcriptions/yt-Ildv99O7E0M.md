### Transcript

> steam workshop question mark don't know uh we have to see when we start uh doing like official mod support and how we wish to tackle that um steam workshop can make sense uh but it also doesn't make sense in some ways because we sell the game on multiple platforms right now it's epic and steam but you know maybe in the future we want to sell it on other platforms as well and we don't want people who bought the game on epic or non-steam platforms to not have access to mods right so we would like us some kind of solution that everyone can use um to access mods and so if we only have steam workshop then that won't make sense um so that could mean that it makes no sense to support steam workshop at all because then it creates a lot of work for modders who then are either need to create mods to support on different platforms or um they might end up only doing steam workshop and then everyone else misses out again so that kind of sucks so it's kind of a weird situation um but right now the way that the mods work that the unofficial modding community has done it works really well it's very easy so if you go to oh my god i'm blanking on the site what's it called physical.yeah.com.org wait fixit.app that's the one i think it's fixit.app yeah yes yes and i've got the um the mod manager modloader manager um there and it's super easy to just like um just enable a mod and then start the game so uh yep pretty pretty good solution at the moment
