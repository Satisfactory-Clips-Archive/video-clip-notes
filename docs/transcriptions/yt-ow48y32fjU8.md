> I played this game a while ago but never installed it as I'm waiting on control support how is it doing, there's probably been I think there's been no progress in control of support and I'm still not entirely sure on what the official stance is going to be on controller support, I think if we could click our fingers and have control support we would want it, for the longest time we did have control support in the very beginning and I think to some degree there is some control of support but there's not a lot of thought that's gone into it, but we didn't want to do it because we thought the game is changing a lot a lot of things are being added we don't really want to keep revisiting control support every single time we do something because we want to focus on getting the design of the game done and getting the features of the game that that are needed in, but then now at the stage I'm not really sure where we stand like- I don't know if the planner right now is well when all that's done we'll get the control support in or not, I think if we can have control support of course we would want it there's so many good reasons, you know some people just like control support but also for accessibility reasons controllers can be really good for people too and so it would be great if we can do that but it all comes down to, you know the planning and prioritizing features and I'm not sure what what the you know the plans or the intention of the team is, on the on the front do people play it on Steam decks okay I'm not sure does people who hit plays satisfaction steam deck does anyone play Satisfaction on Steam deck you do I do okay that's pretty good
