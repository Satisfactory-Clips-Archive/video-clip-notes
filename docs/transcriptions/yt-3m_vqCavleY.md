> it's gonna be a remedy for mark three miners being bottlenecked- I ball naked it sounds like it's bald oh you're a ball naked put on some bottle clothes or something, I've answered this before but we do we haven't looked into that yet, so we don't have an answer to that either we'll add like a the second slot to the miners so when you roboclock them you can have two conveyor belts coming out of them, or we'll see if we can add mark six conveyor belts which we don't know at this time yet if it's possible due to technical limitations actually- I also think it's completely valid yeah just don't do anything it's it's it's kind of it's kind of not really a problem you know like I know that there's like potential that's missing but it actually it actually doesn't matter that much it's just kind of like a theoretical issue but maybe not really a practical one maybe we'll see what we're talking about in general how'd you like that huh huh yeah so that's what you get yeah what if we just yeah we'll just make it say mk3's can't be over that's the only building done yeah that's what you get chat huh better watch yourself yeah but we'll see we'll see it's something that's been heavily requested from communities so like the team is very much aware of it but I don't know it's kind of weird I think I feel like the the request for this has like surged insanely immensely like recently I don't know why because it's been like this since we released the game this has been an issue since day one yes like why why now yeah I wonder if it's because it keeps getting asked and we keep talking about yeah it might be that it might be the muted situation, more people getting their factors up to needing it yeah that could be it to tweak
