> any plans for terraforming the landscape a little bit no not even a little bit or like if you mean if we're going to change i i think the question they're asking is if we're going to add lands like terraform to the game and the answer is no we're not going to add terraform into the game we might change the landscape a little bit in update 5 or like to the map in general the map is still not done there's still work to be done and jase made a video about this specifically for update five but also for like the road towards 1.0 what we're doing with the map they're going to be some landscape changes to doom desert in update 5 and they're not going to really be any landscape changes for the northern forest for update 5 but in the future there may be some landscape changes to other areas in the game question mark probably probably probably maybe we'll see we'll give you guys information what we know
