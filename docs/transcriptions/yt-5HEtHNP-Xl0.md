### Transcript

> can we get proper captions made for video releases, I wish but you have no idea how much work that is, and the the biggest problem is that we can't really do captions on videos until they're like fully done and videos tend to be done like last second so it would end up being the case where like we would have to delay each video by a week if we do that so yeah unfortunately we used to do it we used to do it so that like jace would sit and actually do captions on them but, it was just too much work and we also before before people also suggest this we also used to have community captions for videos back in the day but we still need to like verify them and go through them, and that alone was also too much work so it's just kind of unfortunate, we we try we do captions on the patchiness video and like release videos and stuff like that the the major ones, but unfortunately it's it's like yeah it's too much youtube remove community captions oh maybe they did yeah that was that was that long ago since we actually used it but it was even then it was too much, too much of a hassle to to handle it like and I bet that's why they removed it I don't think, because it wasn't just like you know community caption isn't just us getting a captions and be like all right cool press the button send it what happens is we we do that and then like 40 people show up like hey the captions are completely wrong, can we fix it and then it becomes like a review process of like okay, you can change like this aspect and it goes back and forth and you know we end up like updating captions for videos that were released like a couple of weeks ago

> so yeah feels bad man but that's just how the cookie crumbled on that unfortunately but what if we could I think I think that is really important but we are we don't have enough people and it would reduce the amount of videos we would able to make so it'd be like that I have a goal version of lorem ipsum yeah fake latin
