> is that why the game doesn't pause when you press escape yes that is exactly the reason, pressing adding pause to the game though is like it is doable like it's not you can technically pause the game if you use the console and stuff like that, the reason why we had haven't added pause to the game when you're playing single player is because there are a ton of edge cases, so like what happens if you pause so like you know the thing where like if you pause the game even if you bring up the the menu right you'll play the menu okay like if somebody tries to join you when you do that the game needs to unpause and it needs to figure out that it needs to unpause so like that's one edge case that's probably the biggest one honestly but there's a ton of edge cases where, if players try to connect to you when you're pausing the game, when you don't want that to be the case and like you can drop out because of that and stuff like that it it's it's annoying and like the way that that pause works as well is like it doesn't just pause like the game loop it also pauses like a bunch of other systems, that we don't want to be paused for that to work so it's just like ah it's just like a lot of work that we just haven't maybe we'll get into it at some point it would be nice to have pause, but it's just it's a lot of work for a feature that like you don't get as much out of like it really is like a late thing for us really because of the amount of work that goes into somewhat small feature you know, if you want to pause you can use the console and and then you can live with that issue you know because then it's manually a pause, but once you once we support like proper pausing then there's a bunch of caveats that come with that so, yeah that's that's that's how it is
