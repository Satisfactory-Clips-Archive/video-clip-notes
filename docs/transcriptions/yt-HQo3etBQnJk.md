> i was i don't know yeah i mean either uh more planning more planning has been happening and progress has been made like we're somewhat in the loop of like how that's kind of going and uh yeah i mean it's happening but we can't really talk about it so yeah you know we're just going to hang out just kind of i mean that's kind of how it is like if you haven't been here on our previous uh i love that we're both wearing merch by the way well we are actually yeah on the top of my pile today hell yeah um if you have if you haven't been here the last two weeks or three weeks how long however long we started streaming again um we're kind of in a planning phase if you will about like what we're gonna do what the future of development is gonna be like for the game and we don't really have any news to give on that because we don't even know internally there's been no decisions made yet as to like how we're gonna progress with the game if you will other than like we obviously know that we're gonna work towards 1.0 but you know what happens before then we don't know uh how do we do that how much does it weigh and how much does it weigh so yeah we don't really have any news to give but we do have actually a little bit of an update um that's not really tied into this but like true what's what's gonna happen for you guys a little bit so this week hopefully we're gonna be uh rolling out a new patch to experimental it's not gonna be any major things uh it's just gonna be a minor patch with a couple of bug fixes some localization changes or yeah updates to localization essentially

> and there's going to be a minor engine update to the game which i bet the uh modding community loves to hear um we're updating from 426 to 420 uh we're updating from 426.2 to 4.26 i said that wrong we're updating from 4.26.1 to 4.26.2 yay i did it and that's gonna happen on the experimental branch of the game and we're gonna move over this the current experimental that's right that's that's on experiment right now it's going to move over to ea um and then the new stuff will come on on experimental so uh people have been asking like why we haven't moved over yet and it's because we've been lazy not like we haven't got it around to it but it's happening now uh so some people thought they were going to be in sync but surprise we're actually going to do a little bit of a change to experimental and try right so those those little fixes and stuff we're doing are going to only be on experimental for the moment right yes okay so i guess those of you who use mods on the current experimental version uh you'll probably want to continue using them on or the early access version of the game when we when we do all this moving around this uh and uh i don't think uh the changes we made to like this engine upgrade isn't it like when we've done engine upgrades in the past they've been actually you know major changes to the unreal engine uh this time it's just small like minor bug fixes that epic has made to unreal engine and it's not affected that much it's mostly plug-ins and stuff so i don't think it actually will affect modding that much uh obviously i think they need to update sml for it but i don't think it's going to be like as uh as big of a task as it's been in the past when we've done actual updates yep um as for what like what bug fixes that are coming in i'm not exactly sure i think it's mostly crash fixes and like maybe some other small things um not entirely sure you'll guys know more when the patch has come out yeah i know of at least one of the crashes which was from the um

> vehicle path nodes there was like an issue there and a few people got that over over the christmas new year break and that's been addressed and i think is going to be fixed as well but yeah i mean keep an eye for the patch notes that'll come when i believe the plan is today right maybe today maybe yeah sometime this week hopefully fingers crossed today is is the plan uh but it might be later this week who knows but in the best uh best scenarios that they both both changes come out today it might also be that we just move over experimental ea today or we do both today both moving over experiments with ea and adding new stuff to experimental people asking are you going to tell us about dave i mean we've been talking about game development this entire time yeah okay all right we've been giving you the state of dave uh-huh and dave is doing fine he's breathing he is uh living he's going to be uh updated and then pushed to early access and he's liking it he's into it we have consent yes exactly so yeah the reason why we're updating the engine is because uh linux actually um something with the dedicated servers on linux needed some uh some tweakings oh it's a little bit update to dedicated servers yes there's also we're using i'm using a tool called control rig which is like you can do rigging after the fact that we're gonna probably use for trailers and stuff in the future so that's also we're testing that out and that's also something we needed that was fixed in 426.2 that was crashing a lot at 426.1 um so there's not really like any huge reasons why we're changing the engine update it's it's just it was it was a from our point of view it was easy to do it so we felt like why not do it i know that we had a talk internally about like but what if we're gonna update to 420 when we were releasing the previous engine update we were thinking of we had uh done the most of the things and like do we updated 426.2 or do we like and then we looked there like it's just minor things let's not do it it's not we're probably not gonna do it in the future and then here we are um but anyways i digress um and another little bit of uh newsworthy thing to point out is that satisfactory is on sale whoa oh we are nice yeah um i actually remembered pointing out this time we're part of the i think it's the i think it's part of the lunar sail um oh uh i'm i'm i'm for sure on steam i'm not sure if if epic are doing the same type of deal but anyway we're we're on sale we're 30 uh both on steam and epic maybe on humble bundle too i didn't double check that um so um we're 30 off on epic cool yeah so i think we're 30 off everywhere you guys nice so tell your friends if you had friends who were on the fence now's a great time to uh not pressure them to do anything to have them do whatever they want don't be too pushy hell yeah and if you also have a way yeah i think also if you get the epic did a thing again where if you subscribe to their newsletter you get like a voucher for 10 bucks or something um that you can also apply to it or something so uh yeah almost practically giving it away oh i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry chat i i've i've struck a nerve a lot of our chat chatters don't have friends it would seem uh that's okay if you don't have friends you have each other okay you have each other i'm sure there's someone in chat that like someone else in chat at least someone yeah at least will dave be our friend exactly your buddy dave friendly neighborhood dave oh also uh do you wanna wait let me this isn't i'm just messaging my dad real quick we did i forgot to bring this up before yeah are we doing it um so i don't know how you can put this under community highlight if you want to move the uh this this is a community highlight i guess we yeah we can kick off can we highlight with that actually um yeah is there anything else on the state of dave that we need to bring up um there might be a youtube video this week ooh yeah there's likely going to be one this week it might be pushed to next week if it means getting some new stuff but we have taken a lot of the feedback people give uh had given over the past couple weeks and we have some pretty cool video ideas in the works um we'll sort of see how they pan out if they actually end up coming to be so juicy yeah i guess that's the only other thing really cool
