### Transcript

> okay so I found what I was looking for actually let's continue on so this is in their spline mesh component, we can see where they how they're setting up their data bindings and I'm going to actually copy that because I want that verbatim so we get element shader bindings which we have declared externally right yep so in this we had our old setup of shader bindings which is at the bottom here and this was because we were binding specifically to those parameters, but now we're trying to match theirs more one-to-one as they've optimized it and, packed them in nicely so it doesn't feel like a waste to do it this way, so I'm going to actually just comment out ours that this is like our old one and slam a dam in there is there this is lava david slam a damn name and I should- I'm gonna go back there we always mark up, when we change these files with our cs tags css and this makes merging way way easier in the future but, so we can see if something's intentional or if they change something or if we intentionally changed it leave a comment but for I'll do that that's not fun so I'm going to not worry about that at the moment now I'm just taking a look at make sure there's no conflicts there looks good so now we've changed the instance binding parameter map to just bind I didn't finish that that's right it does nothing we bind text null text I want to see their bindings show me your bindings such as two this is the in it where is there I'm just being done okay it's gonna be in the head I was in our file I see I am being done take a look
