> will we see vr in the future I don't know not really sure it's not it's not at all a priority and so I don't see it really ever getting done anytime soon at all when we have so many other things that like are super super important to do and vr is not a trivial thing like I guess it might be somewhat possible and maybe maybe tr trivial to just get the support in in any way maybe, but to actually make it anything good or worthwhile like I think it takes it would take a lot of effort and I don't think we're super willing to invest in that yet at the moment but maybe later who knows it's clear that there's a lot of people who would like it but I mean if it's if it's a crappy implementation I don't think it would be very fun was the modders mega vr support can they do that I guess I guess maybe yeah so I'm just sitting here staring at the [ __ ] lizard dog right now oh yeah I've still got him on my other monitor
