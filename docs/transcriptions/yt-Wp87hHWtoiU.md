> need to double the toolbar from 10 to 20. that's that's why we have the the radial menu uh to kind of like mitigate that honestly i think tan hop bars is too much because like the point of the hotbar is you're supposed to take like the hottest thing and put it there like if we were able to put everything on the hot bar what was the point of the hot bar again like yeah one hot bar is too much i don't even use the full hopper when i use it another hot take getting all the hot text today i also always throw the wrong bar the wrong direction that's probably why i don't use the hot bar also i don't i can't keep track of like what i've put on the hot bar ha ha bar copy and paste is way faster yeah i hope we improve copy and paste a little bit in the future too
