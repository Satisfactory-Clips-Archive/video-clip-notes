you're dave in here or more dave yeah if you're dave we'd love to know what the state of view is I hope you're doing well yes yes is dave golfing dave here we got another dave jeff builds a base you're not dave don't don't lie did joshy get out of here I can see you on the discord you're not dave get out of here whoa I can be a dave all right dave's on here is spencer close enough that's good enough for me honestly we're not too picky here yeah yeah yeah you can just be spencer dave spencer dave can I be a fake dave I'm a fake dave developer because that's what dave means everybody it means developer it's a really funny running joke that we're going to keep going with for a little longer like changed his nickname on discord 2. exactly yeah exactly I'm a dave no way right jeff it's it's crazy so, yeah state of dave state of development state of development, not really too much to say honestly it's the same kind of situation where there's a lot of planning going on, for the project we have made progress in the planning we've got like more concrete, direction and, some more concrete plans for what we want to do but nothing that we can share with you guys yet, nothing that's like yeah I mean some of it we want to kind of keep secret and build up to you know when updates get closer for example and also some of it is just like it's just kind of too soon to say and then everyone's gonna hope for it to be a specific thing and then maybe we might need to pivot and change later so you know there's still a lot of uncertainty but but, more concrete plan everyone's putting on concrete right now you guys are [ __ ] hilarious you're all banned from the discord too holy [ __ ] yeah, yeah like the that's the state of dev I guess or game dev is that we don't really like have we can guess sort of but it's never really good to like talk too much about our guesswork I mean we do sometimes but when we do like publicly talk about our guesswork then we still like we're further down the line of the guesswork so like it actually they align a bit better we're not there yet yeah we're still guessing shooting from the hip it's like we have vague ideas of what we're going to do in the latter half of the year but it's like what's the point of saying that exactly and, because like anything happens it is really turbulent actually right now or the planning that we're doing because we had one idea what we wanted to do like two weeks ago and then now it's like completely different direction sort of yeah and like if you asked us last year what we were going to do this year we had an idea we had like a plan and then like as we were closer to that we started to realize well this plan isn't going to work what about you know a different plan so like that's exactly what we mean by these plans is like you can use them as like a guideline that we can walk towards but ultimately the closer you get the more you need to reevaluate things it really is like and that's what we're doing development process of like when you think about like this thing needs to happen and you don't really like but what does that thing entail I don't know but it needs to happen and then when you start actually like opening up that box and be like yeah but for that to happen we also need to make this happen and then that has to happen for that happen like and you just the further you go into the chain you just realize like there's so many dependencies and that's how you know feature creep happens and you know how scope creep and plants fall apart and then you kind of like try and like no it's it's fine it's fine you just like live in the the you're owning yourself like no it's fine we still plan for that so that's still happening and then like the more work you do the more you realize that it's not happening, and that's kind of what's happening for planning right now not even actual work yet so, yeah just a lot of stuff going on we did, however, do one little like action I guess or whatever, and that is that we posted a patch today on experimental the patch we talked about two weeks ago finally happened, yeah yeah it's a cursed patch we've been trying for a while both our build system broke down again we were changing it all then people got sick that had to like make sure that the build happens and stuff so but now everything seems to be on there at least hopefully it works too please let us know on the qa side if you're running into any issues with that specific branch if you want to test the experimental branch, as to like what's on it, I mean you can read the patch notes but I can also just give you a quick heads up like we talked about this two weeks ago too but we made like one small change to to one small upgrade to the engine, which like shouldn't affect the game too much shouldn't affect you guys too much but it it improved some things for us internally, and then there's a bunch of bug fixes for like, when vehicles get placed on clients there's a bunch of yeah there's a bunch of vehicle fixes here for client side and issues, there was one crash I think that we yeah actually here's check out the patch notes you guys they're on on our discord on our reddit and stuff, why are you here when you could be checking out the patch notes instead did you put a link in I can add the link yeah I'm trying to find it okay I got it yeah I was looking for the reddit, so yeah that patch maybe will break mods I'm not quite sure exactly how it works for the modern community right now when it comes to these kind of patches because like when we make engine upgrades usually that means that modding community needs to like kind of hustle I say that as if like you guys could fix it but it's not really their fault, but but like they have to like recompile the headers that they have and stuff like that so to be able to like support the stuff and we've only done like a minor update to the engine and I'm not sure if that actually affects the, engine version that they have too much but, most mods are working on experimental teams that's that's dope then yeah yeah because I'm pretty sure like the it only like it it's only when we do major engine upgrades where mods really break down, yeah so hopefully this one is fine sir did be saying that patch was small enough that mods aren't getting affected okay so that's good it's good that it won't cause too many issues for folks it's good twice all right good that was the only thing I was worried about that it would just make everyone not be able to but that's great good to hear, so yeah yeah and the same thing with like if you're running dedicated server you might need to make sure that you're you might get like version mismatch and stuff like that and make sure that you're on the same version as the server blah blah blah, should should be
