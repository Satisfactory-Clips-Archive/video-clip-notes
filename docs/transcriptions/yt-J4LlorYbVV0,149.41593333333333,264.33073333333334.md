> thing that we're not adding to satisfactory is going to be base defense or tower defense those kinds of elements of the game so a lot of people have requested, to have creatures attack your factory and then you need to sort of fight them off repair your factory potentially or build turrets to make sure that your factory stays safe so basically you know the fauna attacking your factory, this is not something that we're actually gonna be adding to satisfactory it's something that's been requested but we have said it for many years that this is not an element of gameplay that we'll be adding to satisfactory one of the reasons for that is it's just kind of not the game we're making we have a different vision of the game we kind of want our game to be chill and relaxed we don't really want the world to impose itself on you the opposite in fact you impose yourself on the world creatures attacking your factories and base defense kind of flies in the face of that we do sort of have like the exploration side of the game and and that does you know aid to provide a little bit more of a stressful or chaotic or, , dynamic side of of the game, but you know again this is something that you can choose to do when you're feeling ready for it you know what i mean that's the the key sort of difference there and and the key reason why base defense doesn't really fit in another reason we can't really do it is that like this is not something that you can just add like this is something we would have had to decide on in the beginning that we wanted and built the game around in that direction it's now certainly way too late five years into making this game i think we're five years, it's certainly way too late for us to then, to now start thinking of base defense and adding those in because it's just it's going to be too much work technically and then also like design wise it's just going to cause way too many headaches and and it's you know it's entirely possible that we could achieve it but what we could also achieve in that same amount of time and with the same amount of resources is to improve the game that we're trying to make in in in a in a more meaningful way rather than pivot into something new so base defense is pretty much off the table it's not going to happen in satisfactory with a pretty high confidence so the second thing that we're not adding to satisfactory is
