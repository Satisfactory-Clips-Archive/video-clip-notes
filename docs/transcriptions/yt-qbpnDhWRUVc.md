> kind of said earlier they're not allowed to watch the stream does that mean everyone has to keep what they're doing secret until they get the hand yeah yeah yeah they're not supposed to tell each other what they're doing like i mean we didn't we didn't say that people aren't allowed to watch the stream, you know they can't if they want it it is better that they don't so that they get surprised by what they get, but yeah the goal is that no one tells anyone what they're doing, and we'll see what happens like maybe people just go into you know disjointed random, maybe people try and build upon what the others have done another one of the rules is that, you can't really tear down what anyone's doing like it it's okay to like make modifications but like you need to preserve the essence of what's already there and then of course you can expand upon it if you want as well, the other thing is, if you didn't know again if you're if you're just joining, we this save file does have some cheats enabled so we have everything unlocked and you, there's no cost to anything you can build anything you want it doesn't cost anything but power is not infinite you need to you need to make power but yeah
