### Transcript

> one thing I'll talk about because some we didn't talk about this but some people have mentioned it is the, the the mug merch, we're still working on that it's taking a bit longer than expected because we need to make sure we find a right, manufacturer and, that can do it in the right quantities and stuff that we want we seem to have made some kind of headway there but I'm not really sure just yeah we're still working on that, and that goes to the merge store in general the eu version as well we're still working on it, super sorry we're not getting around to it as quick as we can it's there is kind of this priority issue here as well where we, we're making a game so and and and so, what's that did you drop out whoa you are freaking the out whoa am I good now does it look oh it looks good on stream but not in discord interesting no it didn't look good in stream it looks fine now yeah yeah okay so good now all right so yeah with the shipping cost of eu and stuff we're still going to try and open up an eu store so that, or like a more worldwide store I guess so that, people can are not going to get screwed over by the shipping costs on our, merch store but, we are working on that it's taking longer than expected partly because of the vacations and then also because, myself and a video edit the video editor who's part of our little community team are kind of chasing around companies for that mostly him but I'm also helping out now yeah, so that's why there's a bit of a delay there but we are working on it's kind of slow because other things are sort of taking priority like the rest of the job, but we are we are working on it but also the process of like working on this is also a pretty tedious process because there's a lot of, like in terms of like negotiation or whatever like there's a lot of that and just like figuring out like all the best alternatives and finding the best alternative like it there's a lot of work there's a lot more work to it than I realized yeah, and yeah this just been we've had a lot of discussions back and forth internally as to which direction we should go and what we can do and what's the best for everyone so yeah just just stick it out with us it's gonna be fantastic I'm sure at some point soon trademark there's a bit of a delay he says while lagging yeah that was fitting cool so yeah so the mug is coming
