> still do that yeah I saw a question like who in the studio plays the game the most who do you think that is is he is it I don't know actually I know that g2, whenever we do something new because his safe is like extremely old right yeah so he's always gonna he's always trying to like make his make add all the new stuff into his, old factory yeah, but the most I don't really know like- I play a lot that I don't really play like like properly because I tend to like play like small sections and just like like new test cases every time I have like a million says that's for tiny tiny things my guess would be actually yeah I've seen him but I also wonder how properly who's who plays when he plays yeah all these stress cases but in that case to playing that's different from testing right then I don't really know but in that case I don't know if anyone really plays the game properly except for you and like because nobody really really plays the game properly like when programmers definitely don't we just test small things- I also don't really play properly so that's nobody plays our game that's why we see what's going on
