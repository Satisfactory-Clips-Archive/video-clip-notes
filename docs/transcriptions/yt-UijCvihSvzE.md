> farming is one of the things that has been suggested a lot internally actually and there is now regrow I think this is a little secret but stefan actually made a thing where if you it's it's not out though but you can actually plant the berries spoiler and that's not something that we that we're sure we want to implement but it might be really nice but I think if we want to do farming it should be bigger than just planting berries and nuts and shrooms right like it should be an actual, proper gameplay path that you can take to do cool stuff with and if we're considering that then that becomes really big all of a sudden and it can be huge yeah that's true that might not be worth it, it is on the list and we have a lot of cool ideas for what that could mean especially tying it into the in the into the game that we already have like how would you use farming with the current factory setup, if we're gonna do those I really can't say, it really depends on how much time we still wanna spend and what we think is more important than something else or not, but yeah cool stuff maybe maybe we'll see probably I don't know I don't work here I don't actually know anything yeah those are all answers you'll hear on conversation streams
