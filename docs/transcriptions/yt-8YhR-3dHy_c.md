> somebody asked if we ever considered putting, community built background stuff in the main menu, I know that other games do it I it sounds interesting but the the problem is that the the way we set up our menu is that it's all custom made so it's not actually like built in game, I think it is possible to do something like that but yes but it is a good it's a good suggestion though I will definitely bring that up, but I don't know essentially the answer I don't know if that's possible yeah at least at least not how the menu works right now we would have to redo the main menu, handling whatever because we used to have back in the day we used to have well even backer in the day we used to have just a video okay yeah even even further back in time we used to have a video of a factory and then that would run it would play the video and I think that video is still in the game file so people sometimes find that and be like oh look there's something leaked here but it's just like old material, but we used to have like a scene we loaded up the the level and like had a scene running but I think we ditched that because it was too like consuming, performance like for from menu to load all that information up just to display it so that's why we've been running kind of with this the menu that we have now so that it's not as taxing yes
