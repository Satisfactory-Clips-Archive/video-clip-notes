> um i saw a question about when will experimental come to ea that's a really good question i don't know if we actually have an answer to that uh because we haven't planned to do that for a while as far as i know because there's going to be there's going to be like some updates to languages on experimental and it's going to be happening continuously but i don't think those are going to move over to ea until update 5. so i actually don't know the state of that currently apart from from that we are gonna try and update translations in the game uh in the coming weeks
