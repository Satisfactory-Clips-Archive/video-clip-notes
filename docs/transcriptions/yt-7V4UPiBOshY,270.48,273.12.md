> someone just told me that on Kotaku that they spell my last name VAR la y hi my name is Jace I'm a programmer and the community manager here at coffee stain studios and recently you may have heard that satisfactory will be an epic game store exclusive title a lot of people all over the Internet's had questions about that so I'm going to answer them for you now it's gonna be a long video so let's just jump it let's go who forced you to do this uh-huh no one we we just chose to do it but then why yes do we have a bunch of reasons why we went with the epic game store and one of the first reasons is because we have a long working relationship with epic since the very beginning of coffee-stained we've only been using Unreal Engine apart from like a couple mobile games so we have a really good relationship there with epic another thing is we like that it is an option like another option which then only focuses on giving sort of quality curated titles so that's kind of cool another thing is the revenue share obviously it is better than other places and what we would like to be a part of is trying to set that as a new standard for the industry which would be super cool having said all that who knows maybe it's no good maybe this just doesn't work out crashes and burns we have no idea we can't predict the future so we're gonna be evaluating this as we go hopefully hopefully things work out so that's all the reasons why I'm kidding yeah we got cash money we got payment for the exclusivity deal now how that's good for us and maybe even good for you is that one it gives us stability as a studio it guarantees that we can keep going it guarantees that we will be fine after creating satisfactory it means we may be able to support it for longer if we have a move on from satisfactory that we can have you know we're gonna have a better budget to create better games now one thing about getting a bunch of money is that it's quite easy to promise yeah we're gonna put it into great creative games in the future and then just like not do that the way that we chose to make satisfactory was not like this corporate board room which is like hey I think this is a great niche market to get into we should do that no it was literally the developers the programs and the designers and one that voted to make it we had a prototyping process where a bunch of games with thoughta and us the developers chose to make satisfactory I don't know I think we have a nice history there of putting our resources into cool projects so I hope that you know us being financially stable with satisfactory means we really will keep doing that in the future is it a timed exclusive deal yeah it's actually a timed exclusive deal it is twelve months long and then after that we can put the game wherever we want whether we will or not I don't know I don't want to tell you after twelve months it'll be on Steam and then like maybe we just choose not to put it on Steam I don't know we have no plans regarding that so please don't really have any expectations there but the the deal is twelve months long and then who knows what happens after that but I hate epic all of my games are on Steam sure I can understand that I can understand that that is aggravating disappointing annoying I'm not sure if that's a deal-breaker for you then I can understand that however the game will be exclusive on a big game store and if that is a deal-breaker for you if you don't want to support epic if you don't want to support satisfactory or coffee saying anymore then I support that decision you should make whatever decision is best for you and all I can say is I support that go for it it's your choice I actually just can't use the epic launcher it doesn't work for me or it's not supported for my OS now that really sucks I'm I'm super sorry to hear that the only thing I can say is that the epic games launcher is being actively developed it's not done yet so the only thing I can hope for there is that these issues will be addressed in the future the only thing I can say to you is bug epic make sure they know about it they probably do but bug them anyway hope I don't get in trouble for saying that and hopefully they address those issues soon so that you have access to the launcher but I don't want to have another launch or open in the background you actually won't need to have the launcher open in the background or even be signed in or anything satisfactory can be played offline and if that's the case you want you do once you're open but if you want to use any online features like to play multiplayer then yeah you need to have the launcher open and signed in and whatnot the Alpha at the moment is a closed alpha and so therefore for now that you wonder is required but in the future it won't it won't be required is there an early access feature on the epic store yep do you think not revealing anything sooner was misleading we were actually under NDA so we couldn't actually say anything and it was up to epic to make the announcement so we couldn't say anything sooner in fact I told you as soon as I could I was literally in my living room with my iPhone and I made a video and put it on YouTube I told you as soon as we could do the people at coffee-stained even used the epic launcher as gamers yeah of course we have it do you guys know play for at night yeah we are all gamers here some of us are we play a lot of games some of us are filthy casuals some of those have lower slayer levels than 80 and rinse cape some of us like Steam some don't some of us like the epic launcher some don't we're just gamers like you are so everyone is different but do your evil corporate decision-makers play video games yeah they do there's this like one evil corporate decision maker named Tim and he's always playing Call of Duty or something and then there's obviously Anton and he placed so much dota I'll I'll try and convince him to let me put his hours in this video so that like they all play video games you're an evil corporation goddess the revenue share doesn't matter if you don't have any customers eighty-eight percent of nothing is still zero something something haven't you even considered that yes we have why did you leave satisfactory on Steam for so long and then do a bait and switch were you just using it from marketing slash of visibility before we were exclusive on epic we were on Steam and we intended to be on Steam in fact we intended to only be on Steam but that obviously changed and we didn't really want to raise any question marks because of the NDA we wouldn't be able to answer any questions in the two days last week between when the steam store page went down and when we exclude announced the exclusive deal with epic the reaction was unreal and so given what we know now looking in hindsight you know we could have done it that way and like maybe that was the better thing to do maybe it wasn't if we took the steam store page down and then started giving out alpha keys people gonna be like well where did the keys go and we can't say anything about it would have been months of questions with no answers so we we made the best decision that we could at the time and we thought that was the best thing to do and so that's what we went with is the alpha being done via epic yep but epic launcher doesn't have insert feature the epic launcher is still being developed it's brand new and you know we can see it being developed as we work alongside epic so if there's a feature that you want and the epic store doesn't have that yet there's a good chance that it's gonna be added in the future for example like achievements will be there and I think reviews will be there as well but look what epic did with other games I loved Paragon and they just cancelled it said it's satisfactory is still our game so we can do whatever we want with it epic can't like cancel our game they can't do anything to our game it's ours we're just selling it over on the epic story was the Alpha always on Epic a so this closed alpha that we've been doing sending keys out to the public slowly that has that has all been on the epic store did you ever give steam keys before the exclusive deal with epic we had given steam keys out to close friends and family so that they could test the game and check it out so obviously they played it on Steam at that time but then after things changed and we went with the epic store then they couldn't play on Steam anymore no one can we can't even play on Steam anymore and everyone who had a steam key at that time now has an epic key and everyone plays by the epic story is there a refund policy yep there is a 14-day no questions asked refund policy is their regional pricing on the epic game store yeah there is regional pricing on the epic game store and I'm just gonna read what they said here the store is currently live with eight currencies Brazil and Argentina are still in US dollars but more currencies will be added early to 2019 as of today epic currently supports local pricing in US dollars great British pounds you were polish you say that polish zloty Russian ruble South Korean Won Japanese yen Turkish lira and Ukrainian arrhythmia Ukrainian prison you got it first try didn't even have to look anything up is the epic game store DRM free there is no DRM on the epic game store and it's up to the developers if they want it or not if they do want it they put it on themselves it's up to them to provide it we have not put DRM on any bad games before so we will probably not do it with we have no plan to do it satisfactory however as I said before if you do want to use online features you do have to have the launcher open and be signed in what about the security breaches in the past with epic yeah there was a pretty big breach huh like I even got burnt by it as well someone like hacked into my account and like bought $100 of e-books and then I had to get a refund and I did get it but that was a complete pain in the ass so that's super unfortunate so I I can totally understand if you have security concerns again this is one of those things that you know you make your decision here if you cannot trust epic on this because of the security of your personal details and information you know then don't write so I can totally understand that and you know it would be you know I could totally do like a what about ISM here and be like you know but there have been breaches on other stores but that doesn't matter right like what matters is if you're gonna go to a platform you don't want your [ __ ] stolen right so again you make that call yourself what is right for you what are the payment options for Epic Games store so I don't think anyone actually asked this question but I do remember seeing that some people said but the game story epic game store doesn't take credit cards in my region and that's pretty bad so I went online and I went to check more information but I got distracted by the fact that you can pay via subway gift card instead of by your footlong meatball sub with cheddar cheese you could just buy a game did I just give the prize away your community manager is unprofessional you should be ashamed what gave you that idea I trim my pubic hair don't miss anything for Jim awful [ __ ] sake Simon what are you doing then make it great I have no idea what you're talking about hey everyone its Jase from the future here something that I forgot was to thank the people who supported me and the reason that I forgot to do that is because I'm an idiot the way that I do the Q&amp;A is is on my script I just had the questions and then bullet points for the answers and then I just wing the interim wing the out four and so I forgot to do this so I just want to say a big thank you to all the people who do actually support us people who are saying that they're gonna buy the game regardless doesn't matter about the launcher I get a lot of like DMS in private as well of people who are supporting us so it's super cool also want to say thank you to the people who are uncertain they just want to wait and see that's super cool as well you know again make the decisions that's best for you and if that means you need to wait and see before you're convinced perfect even want to say thank you to the people who have just decided that they don't want to do this because it's a deal breaker cool I can understand that and specifically I'm thinking the people who did so who let me know let us know respectfully thank you very much for doing so and then there are the other people who weren't so respectful so let's get back to the outro alright everyone that was a lot of questions dare I say an epic amount of questions and in fact it was every question that I could find online I'm sure I'd miss something somewhere but that is everything that I could find and I'm really glad that the the the evil corporation people here at coffee-stained let me answer every single one's that's great now you've got the meat of the situation the meatball sub with cheddar cheese if you will so if you found this video interesting or enlightening please consider sharing it so we this information can you get out there if you hated this video if you hate me and my hair please don't share it and tell everyone how you hate it this is a reverse psychology alright everyone I'll catch you next time bye
