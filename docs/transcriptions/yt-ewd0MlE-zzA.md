### Transcript

> um mass building like the smart mod i don't know what we've decided we keep going back and forth on this um yeah i can't i can't really say too much because we haven't decided anything yet we do want to make some i think the way we it's going to go down is first we're going to work on the the improvements to building stuff and we get that out of the way and then we take that feedback that we get from that and see if it's still an issue and stuff like that and then we build upon that because it's kind of hard to when we know that we're working on on improvements to the game in some aspect it's hard to know we want to like close in on those things before we move on to some other problem because sometimes when we introduce a new thing it can cause other problems or it can solve things and it's unnecessary to start working on stuff like that um until we've tried something else so we're gonna introduce some better build modes and stuff like that um in a coming update and then we'll take it from there
