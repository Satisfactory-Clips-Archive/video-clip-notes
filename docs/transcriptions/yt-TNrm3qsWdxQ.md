> anything will there be more seasonal events uh i don't know we don't know actually uh because like this this thing the seasonal event here was kind of like a bonus thing um because we wanted to do a seasonal event last year and we didn't have time for it because of update 3 and like the steam release and all that stuff we were working really hard on that stuff uh so it kind of depends on where we are in production uh whether we can make it or not like this fixmas update we had to start working on that like in july i think like pretty much after we got back from vacation uh we had to start planning for that just because it's just so much work um that you can't like at the start of december which wouldn't be possible because we put it on the 1st of december but like you can't start thinking about this in november because then it's not going to happen essentially so we'd have to plan a bit like for that so it kind of depends where we are in production if we're really busy with like update 4 or update 5 or update 6 or whatever um then that will take precedence but it's not impossible you promised did i never no i didn't i th it's likely but i don't know um so yeah
