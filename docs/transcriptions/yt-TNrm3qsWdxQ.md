> anything will there be more seasonal events, i don't know we don't know actually, because like this this thing the seasonal event here was kind of like a bonus thing, because we wanted to do a seasonal event last year and we didn't have time for it because of update 3 and like the steam release and all that stuff we were working really hard on that stuff, so it kind of depends on where we are in production, whether we can make it or not like this fixmas update we had to start working on that like in july i think like pretty much after we got back from vacation, we had to start planning for that just because it's just so much work, that you can't like at the start of december which wouldn't be possible because we put it on the 1st of december but like you can't start thinking about this in november because then it's not going to happen essentially so we'd have to plan a bit like for that so it kind of depends where we are in production if we're really busy with like update 4 or update 5 or update 6 or whatever, then that will take precedence but it's not impossible you promised did i never no i didn't i th it's likely but i don't know, so yeah
