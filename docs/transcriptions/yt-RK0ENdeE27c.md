### Transcript

> that's a line um i think it's better to stack the input and outputs we we ho we think so too honestly because like it will make it so that uh like it will reduce all the like criss-crossing of like belts and pipes when you set up like a large row of them so like being able to have them on on you know different levels so to speak i think will really improve it but but it's it's a bit of an experiment for on our part um so make sure to hit us up with your feedback once that update goes out you like it or not
