### Transcript

> so we've changed a little bit how the pathing works with the vehicles let me see if I can go to that section here like the the visuals for the the vehicles are improved so, you we used to have like physics that would turn on and off and it wasn't like when when they switched between turning off you would definitely see it in the distance you'd also see like weird like it would like jump and jag and do weird in the background, and now we're sort of simulating that stuff yeah yeah so it's like hard to tell when it's actually switching between the different modes here, and, yeah the pathing is changed it's much more reliable, when you're recording pathings they they should stick better to the way they used to work, I believe there's a segment of that here is that the first one, yeah that's that part, and, let's see yeah here's that segment so now we're using like a system that's like looking ahead instead correct me if I'm wrong jace, yeah so before what it would do is it the the vehicles would just naively, yeah I'm wearing the same hoodie exactly hey nice shirt chase, yeah so before it would just naively just charge straight ahead at the waypoint but now it sort of takes these curves from the splines into considerations and the splines which are the lines that connect all the waypoints, they smoothly connect from one to the other and so you know the vehicles start turning before the it reaches the waypoint and stuff like that as well, whereas before it would, you know it's like the blinkers would be on it would charge only at that waypoint it wouldn't even think about braking or anything like that until it hit the waypoint and figured out what to do after that so this should, basically mean that your vehicles will will stay a little truer to the, to the intended path intended path yeah, it's still not going to be like 100 like exactly how you when you when you're driving it and recording the path it's not going to act like behave like exactly the same way yeah but it should be way better you shouldn't have to worry about it too much yeah exactly
