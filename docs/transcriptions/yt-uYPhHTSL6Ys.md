### Transcript

> from stick stone separately very nice, okay well shall we get into it yes so let's let's quickly get through state of dev nothing's happening all right next question, so sata dev is we're still trying to, fix all the crashes that are happening on experimental right now we were pretty confident that we fixed most of the issues now with the the the client related crashes, this weekend so fingers crossed like the fix we made last monday no sorry this monday yesterday god I don't have any like track of time anymore, we pushed a fix yesterday and hopefully that would resolve most of the issues so if you're still having crashes as client when you're connecting there are tied to like something with the conveyor belts or whatever then, please make sure to, like report the crash in their crash reporter or go to our qa site, and, yeah post it there and, that's pretty much it like we have we have a a like little thing coming next week possibly I don't know how much we spoiled that today, oh, yeah we can say we can say I think yeah to the best of our ability to the best of our knowledge, we believe the engine upgrade update will come out, on tuesday next week that is yeah unless something goes wrong but will you feel like that's what's gonna happen, this week, I will be releasing a video with more information about that update, it's it's also gonna go over just like some of like, some small things that we get with the engine upgrade that will that will hopefully impact your experience playing the game in terms of like performance or whatever, and I might mention a couple things that you know we benefit from as developers because maybe as a gamer maybe you don't know what, in what ways an engine upgrade can impact the developer as well so it just might be interesting right so, yeah probably, engine upgrade on tuesday next week and then a video on thursday or friday with information about that and I'm trying to get some like I'm gonna see if we can get like some like actual raw data as well to see where we may have gained, some performance or whatever so we'll see what those numbers look like and, we'll take a look yeah, impact meaning crash your game absolutely, that is a possibility so upgrading and I'll go into detail on that in the video I really hope I remember to do that, but yeah usually upgrading the engine can, cause some instability issues especially since we've edited the engine ourselves to get the game to where it is so sometimes it can get a bit tricky when we upgrade the engine and this is a big upgrade this time we're going like three versions or something so it's probably there's probably going to be some issues but hopefully there's also going to be some some big improvements because everyone wants mirrors this guy in his mirrors I swear to god, and I guess I guess you know what someone asked about the, the mug before I guess that's kind of a state of dev thing we can give you an update on that, the the current situation with mugs is, we pretty sure we know who we're going with and all that kind of stuff and we, to the point now where we're sort of in the final sort of ish phases of like just prototyping it or whatever, basically and so we think that you know it we might try get it out around with update 4 around that time, the mug but, it's it's no longer this big thing about like, you know previously the state of the mug was yeah we kind of think we know where we're going we have some ideas we're not sure when but now there's a pretty good estimate as to when, we could expect the mug, and it should be around update four maybe a little bit after unless things change, let the mug have eu prices it won't because we still only have the same shop but eu store is still something that we are actively looking into and working on right now so who knows it we we may be able to have that at that time I kind of don't think so though if we do get an eu store what's likely going to happen is it's going to be an eu store with all the basic stuff you know like your hoodies and stuff but maybe some special things and premium things like the mugs might end up not being on the store at first that's kind of kind of how it looks like things will be but, we're gonna keep looking into it, and we'll let you know, once we know more dope yeah so there's that, anything else I think that's pretty much it yeah pretty much that is it, yeah I guess yeah next next week will be the first of december yeah december being the month of christmas or the holiday season or whatever people call them call it call that period in your part of the world, and so we can give some there'll be some stuff happening then and we can talk more about it next week as well so yes it's gonna be cool
