### Transcript

> any news on Paradise Island well I mean it's the same news as before that we're gonna probably get rid of it we'll see we don't know by the way just to clarify something that any the map changes are not coming in update seven so like people have been saying if Paradise Island is going to get rid of we're going to lose in update seven is not correct I said in the video that we don't know when World changes are going to happen we'll see when that happens so enjoy Paradise Island while you can

> earthquake so if you don't know it could be an update seventh the only thing I know is it's not an update seven for sure you can tell is the original plan for Paradise Island I think the original plan was to, you know give it the same kind of treatment as everything else that we're doing with the game when it comes to polishing but we've decided that we're not going to spend any more resources on that so we're not going to spend any more time on it essentially tldr which means that we can't you know do anything with it what's wrong with Paradise Island the problem with Paradise Island is that it's too close to the Keel sphere and there's nothing on it so it's not like interesting and it's also not polished so it doesn't have the same like quality as everything else so it's a bit weird and we don't have the resources to to tweak it and fix it so you know the obvious easy step is to just, but it might also be that we just move the kill plane and just leave it as it is I don't know we'll see but, right now it's on the chopping board it's ever deleted well it's effort to keep it too because people people tend to build there and they're confused as to why you die like we have to make borders eventually and we're gonna do like one of the not not the last thing but like one thing we also need to do that's not tied into like the world of the the part of the world update is that or changing the world is doing all the borders and the Paradise Island is on one of these borders, so once we make the borders and we feel like it doesn't make sense and it doesn't look good you know then we'll cut it because the original plan for Paradise Island was that we're gonna do more with it we were going to extend it, but we're not doing that anymore I've blame voice meter yeah exactly for Paradise Island
