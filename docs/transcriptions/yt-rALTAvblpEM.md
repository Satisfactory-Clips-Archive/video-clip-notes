> this water looks better people saying that they like this water better you know what don't be mean I don't I don't agree, I think, like compared so so one thing also that needs to be pointed out, like the the world design that's out on the build right now that's not as good as it looks right now like in the actual build because we have the world branch that the our ui our level designers are working on like that is way the video with ben right that's what the water is like now but it's not public yeah so if you wanted to see if you want to see what the new water is going to look like I'll I'll grab that that video real quick for you guys yeah and it's a video that- I did with our tech artist and he, talks a bit about, the the water updates so so yeah like the the even in the world right now because I when I was doing this there's a few, instagram poems coming up where I take one shot of the world in this build and then I compare it to what it looks like in the actual build and it looks like so much better and sent that to hannah and then hannah was like yeah and this is what it looks like in our version of the game that's not out and it looks so much better even compared to what's out currently yeah so there's there's so much juicy stuff coming to the world, and when that comes out I don't know but, new water looks bad you don't know that because you haven't seen it yeah oh unless you just checked on the video then you have seen it it doesn't look bad you look bad yeah so another thing to point out I guess like this because like this version has screen space, you just checked it yeah reflection, which is like one of the things we had to get rid of, from this build to the current one because of performance issues and now we're reintroducing it where we actually fix it
