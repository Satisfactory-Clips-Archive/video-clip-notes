> can two stations have the same name aka parallel stations will a chain enter at the free station no so there isn't that kind of logic you can I think you can give stations the same name but it's not going to treat them as like the same station where and and then the train will pick one that's free, you're just gonna it's just gonna be confusing in your timetable which station you wanna be using you can of course have two different stations, in parallel and then have different trains go to one or the other you can and you can call them the same and you could do it that way if you want, but there's no like smart logic that makes the trains pick one station over another but I can tell you from experience that it's hella confusing you want to at least call it like train station left transition right or something like that
