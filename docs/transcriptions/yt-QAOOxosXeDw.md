### Transcript

> past time of day by sleeping in Hub I don't think that's something we're gonna add I think that's something that people have brought up before and I didn't think anyone at the office once to include that because it it sort of undermines the game a little bit, I guess we could have it if because the people there's two reasons people did it right or requested it one was night time was too dark but if night time's too dark or too problematic we should just find solutions to make nighttime not problematic then you don't need a passing time of day feature another feature is another reason is because you could do that and then things could build up and then you know you just need some items and you can just like Fast Track the time right but that undermines the game so those are the two reasons that I've heard about time of day stuff yeah
