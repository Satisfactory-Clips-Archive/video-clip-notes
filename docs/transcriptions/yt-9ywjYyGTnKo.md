### Transcript

> do you know how much we've translated or sorry the community is translated for words that just like weren't supposed to be in the the the file and just like we removed because uh i don't know maybe like a couple hundred thousand oh uh are bad yeah yeah that was the the early days especially there was like a lot of like technical stuff yet yeah yeah like borderline leak stuff in there as well which is a bit bonkers yeah cause one funny antidote i have here was that uh before we released update three um somebody pointed out that like hey there's a word for pipe in the translation file yeah and we were like wait did we leak that and and we checked it out it was like no this is super old stuff that we like that that part that got like tran part of the transfer file hadn't anything to do with the pipes that we were making there was something else pipe related uh luckily no one caught on that yeah but uh yeah so sometimes there might be things in the translation file that's just like old stuff that we haven't removed from the translation file there's still so many left arrows especially after update for sec yeah the thing is that's part of my job to kind of tell the development team that everything that they write in the game uh basically by default gets exported for localization so they should mark some things as non-translatable like placeholders or something they put there just to have some text during design or debug and i think now is everything is much better but the problem with the old text is that it's not that easy to delete it so what we do is we hide it on crowding and at least it it gets hidden from translators and they don't have to translate it to get to 100 of the file right right sick okay
