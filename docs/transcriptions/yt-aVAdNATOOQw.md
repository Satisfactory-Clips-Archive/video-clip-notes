> is satisfactory called factory game in the project code for unreal yes, i heard i've heard yes exactly it is, correct i've heard that it is quite hard to change it and a lot of tools i use show the true name of application called color factor game yeah so we called it factory game and you're right it is hard to change which is why we haven't changed it i don't know if or when we ever will, the longer we we go into this the harder it gets changing the name, but like this is a this is a somewhat common problem for unreal engine games specifically i know that like arc is still called shooter game which is like the name of the template project in unreal engine when you like when you boot up unreal engine you can pick like if you want like a clean template like if you want a clean project with nothing in it or if you want like a template project with like some base functionality in it and, one of them is called shooter game which is like a first person shooter like it's it's it's unreal tournaments like in a small like yeah segmented like thing yeah i think i think i don't talk was sangdom called furious i can't remember now that you mention it that because i know i know that it was called like i know that the the the code classes and stuff were sg yeah and i don't know if it was sanctum game or shooter game that's a good question and i get the feeling that when they started making the project they probably didn't know the game was called sanctum that's my assumption stargate you're right it is stargate game very good coffee stain got the license thing for that make a game for it yeah and i'm pretty sure like factory game is also based on that template, with the first person shooter thing maybe i feel like most first-person games in a real engine usually based on that but i don't know yeah but we call it factory game because we didn't want to call it shooter game because it's confusing and it's not a shooter game yeah it's a factory game it is yeah, sure glad yeah i'm sure glad we couldn't didn't call it factorio 3d game when we started that project well that would have been weird yeah whoops
