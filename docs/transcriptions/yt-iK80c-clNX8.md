### Transcript

> and another thing oh god I love light so much, I love the lights in the update so much yeah they're right yeah yeah they're okay god damn it they're so good, but they're amazing- I love what people have done with me yeah and they're built unbelievable it's one of like the most, one of the coolest things we've added yeah the community what the community did with it it's yeah it's it's yeah it's really crazy and, yeah we see here it's pretty straightforward it's concepts for lights that we thought of and again, you see like, looking into the sizes looking into placement options and looking to make it fit to existing buildings because what we usually do is we take existing buildings and see what kind of logic can we just recycle and reuse because fix it would obviously not use 10 different types of bolts or screws for example it would be reused so we try to reuse like engineering approaches as much as possible and on the right side you see the street lights that we have in the game now and they are they're a very old 3d model, I can't tell you how old I probably should know that but it is, it's like part of even the closed alpha like the pre-alpha build that we had so they're really old especially specifically the one to the right the street light one yeah that's been in the that's that's something that we've tried for a long ass time or like there was a model for at least for a long time exactly the model was around and we just cleaned it up essentially so it was it was an archaeological find that we polished and now you all have it in your factory
