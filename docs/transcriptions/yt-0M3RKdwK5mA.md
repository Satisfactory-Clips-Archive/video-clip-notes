### Transcript

> i don't know when when official mods support one drop, i mean we do have ish like right now there is an official inofficial mod support in the game for the game our modding community is amazing, but we don't have like the official mod support yet and i guess i can touch on that as well because people are gonna ask this later than one as well whether we're gonna have like steam workshop support or epics whatever they're calling it they have a name for it but right oh whatever, epic have their own version of workshop as well and they're about to release it, it's like really really really soon gonna be available i think they're waiting honestly my this is i'm, what's the word this is my guess i think they're waiting for more games to have proper mod support until they actually launch it because i think it's done because they've been talking about a lot but yeah we don't know whether or not the game will have like official, steam workshop support, because it kind of comes down to like the ecosystem of mods we really want to like sustain the mods that are made already and the modern community that we have we, we like really love our money community that we have right now so we also want to be able to support both, versions of the game both on epic and on steam so you don't feel like left out so we don't want to run into a situation where like you know you know there are better mods in the steam version than on the epic version because we'll be you know unfair to the people that, first of all bought on epic and the people that want to buy on epic and even if we and even if like epic have their own version and we have steam workshop like if it's a hassle for mod makers to have to like upload to two different places then it's also not you know the best solution for everyone, and in that case we'll probably make like our own in-game mod manager maybe or something like that or we'll maybe extend the one that they've already created i don't know these are speculations on my part, but we do really care about, mod support and it will happen eventually officially for the game at some point hashtag so yeah that's that's the, tldr of that situation well said thanks
