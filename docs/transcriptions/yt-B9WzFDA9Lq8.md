> um will dedicate run on linux windows or both so we are like windows is the priority uh but we have like linux at the back of our mind so like we're not like you know we're thinking of it has been it has been developed with linux and exactly so so we're not forgetting about linux um but we don't know for sure like if we're gonna like release both at the same time or whatever yeah we can't guarantee that linux will be as stable as windows the reason we focus on windows is not necessarily because windows is better server or whatever it's just because the game right now is built for windows and so there is more chance that or less chance that there are going to be platform specific issues with the um the game uh with the server running on windows than if we switch over to linux and that's literally the only reason why yes um someone mentioned docker docker containers uh yeah so uh we've seen a lot of people request docker as well and so we've talked to um we've we've we've taken that information on board that feedback on board and uh i think we're going to look into it yes i'm pretty sure we're going to be looking into docker as well a lot of people seem to want it and it seems like a no-brainer from the sounds of things
