### Transcript

> are you going to break save games again, yes, yeah yes, yeah kind of you have a video on that, you do it's, essentially tier seven will get a re re-haul of, some of the chains there, and the video js is about to to post will go in depth as to like what production lines are affected by the change and it's, it's like battery nuclear chain i think, yeah yeah i can't remember you're in the video so you should know i like i remember i said it in the video and then i forgot yeah we referred you to that video because that that video is in depth as to like what exactly is changing because that's that's all the information that that you really need actually, as to what's coming and the options you have is either you can stockpile if you already built tier seven, you can stockpile the stuff there and if you're like on tier six and you're like should i go to tier seven or not, yeah you can either wait, or you can invest in it and see what it looks like now and be like oh it's so frustrating to do it this way and then see how much better it is in update four but as as, as previously the intention is that the save files will load yeah, and you but you will just have to remake large sections of your factory if it's affected by the the the things that i talk about in that video, i think i remember recently it was a few months ago smirking, reloaded like he loaded, an update to save yeah i saw that and and one and started like refactoring that yeah working again and yeah i mean it would load he just had to go and fix it yeah and i think he like finished it and went up all the tiers and just like completed the game as it is currently with that save file so that was pretty interesting, cool
