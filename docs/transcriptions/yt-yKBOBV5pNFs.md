### Transcript

> up the ports and you're done yeah uh okay do you have any more to show here or do you want to go into uh no one thing i can say though is that the the shot was like this is three different like layers of drones because i'm switching back and forth with the focus yeah to try and like add like a little bit of like as if this was filmed with a real camera it's like a thing where you try to add like you know camera issues or whatever i'll just play that one moment just so people can see just pay attention to the focus you guys there you go and it's like doing it's also doing something that's called like focus seeking where you know auto focus on cameras they try to like what am i supposed to focus on and the way they do it is that they they focus they pull the focus away until they notice like oh i'm past the the subject that i'm saying and then they come back and i try to emulate that uh with this yeah so it's trying to auto focus so you can see like one of the drones like flies past the center yeah when it hits the center it's like oh what the [ __ ] and it switches back that was really tricky to get it look like yeah you did really really great there yeah i i don't know i was kind of half pleased with it but it you know i mean i mean like if i'm gonna be super real like i mean i can tell that it was done in post but it's it's still really good and believable it's not one of those things it's not jarring it doesn't like pull you out or anything like that you you you totally buy it in my opinion yeah you know but it's also so fast that you maybe don't like even catch it but yeah it totally it totally adds to the like this without the fairies oh you could see it there yeah yeah no those little touches where you don't notice it but you feel it are really important exactly uh in in so many things uh yeah very important and then this [ __ ] mask drone where the drone flies past the camera oh i [ __ ] love that [ __ ] and like to unveil to this shot i think is great because now that you show these ports like i feel like these drones become so much more legitimized with this shot it's like yo look at these drones they got these ports they take up a lot of space kind of you know the ports take up space they're real you know like they're yeah super good yeah super super good i love this shot here i love that this is the next shot yeah and then the drone comes down from the same like kind of angle oh so so pleased with this the one thing i would have spent a little bit more time on is color grading the drone so they match a little bit better in game but oh here because they're more yellow here more orange yeah that that was but that was some that was something in the game i don't quite get why that happened sure these drones are a little bit more like uh desaturated than the ones and but it also looks weird if i added too much saturation so it's like a trade-off there okay thanks sub staff that's helpful thank you appreciate it man uh okay do you have any more bts stuff do you want to show your stream more or are you good oh do you want to log we should show a log when we have like actual log footage okay yep okay so we'll keep going
