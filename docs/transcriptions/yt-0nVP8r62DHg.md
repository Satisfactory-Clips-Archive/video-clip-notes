> since you put the position for, generalist game designer for the office I'm wondering do you have plans for interns we've hired interns in the past you can always go and submit an open application to our website coffeestainstudios.com jobs, you can always you know put in open applications there we don't take many interns but we do take some yeah, and we have taken I don't think we're taking an intern for design but it doesn't matter you can just apply, historically I think the the rule of thumb is that like we won't take in an intern unless we feel like we're gonna offer them like a position afterwards something like that like yeah if it feels bad to like is it right a little bit of insight for you guys here but there's a little bit of like a bad thing that some game devils do where they just like they hire interns and then let them go and then hire interns and let them go over and over again and it's it's not it's not a good practice to do that and that's something that we don't want to like do sort of yeah well yeah many not not all but but many many interns that have worked for us have gone on and, yeah have stayed with us afterwards yes some even became game directors oh yeah was that mark was that mark was he interned first right I couldn't be maybe he's not I don't know maybe he wasn't yeah I'm not sure actually he might because he might have done it because he studied at the same place as, hannah and natalie right is that right yeah I can't remember yeah yeah it's better to bring people in if you have a spot for them because it's it's it's always it's always hard right like to start from scratch with people every single time you know they learn the system then they leave and they have to you get a new person who doesn't know the system it's kind of weird exactly, my chest isn't at the internet
