> blueprints for repetitive factory setups what was the status on blueprints again mark keep changing his mind on this back and forth I think the last thing he said was that he likes the idea now and, like doesn't know exactly to what degree blueprints will happen if it does in the game, I remember he once talked about like we were inspired by the, I can never remember their reddit name but, there's there's someone something foam, that posts like blueprints or like small, layouts of like here's how you can make this many, ingots permitted in this small segment, and we were inspired by that be like yo that would be sweet sweet if like you could set up a blueprint that was like in a you know maybe five by five or like ten by ten or like a small segment of space, and be able to like build that whatever, put some limitation to it old shaving foam thanks yeah they post a bunch of really neat looking, like collections of different setups that I think is pretty sweet, so we were a little bit inspired by that in the ways of thinking of blueprints but I don't know exactly we don't know what exactly is going to happen with that, I guess we'll burn that bridge when we get to it
