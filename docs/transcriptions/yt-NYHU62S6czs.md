> blueprints for repetitive factory setups what was the status on blueprints again mark keep changing his mind on this back and forth i think the last thing he said was that he likes the idea now and uh like doesn't know exactly to what degree blueprints will happen if it does in the game uh i remember he once talked about like we were inspired by the uh i can never remember their reddit name but uh there's there's someone something foam uh that posts like blueprints or like small uh layouts of like here's how you can make this many uh ingots permitted in this small segment um and we were inspired by that be like yo that would be sweet sweet if like you could set up a blueprint that was like in a you know maybe five by five or like ten by ten or like a small segment of space um and be able to like build that whatever uh put some limitation to it old shaving foam thanks yeah they post a bunch of really neat looking uh like collections of different setups that i think is pretty sweet um so we were a little bit inspired by that in the ways of thinking of blueprints but i don't know exactly we don't know what exactly is going to happen with that uh i guess we'll burn that bridge when we get to it
