> have you thought about integrating chat AI chatbot, wait the question disappeared oh I can check the pin now oh that's actually so useful, except I can't, how do you into the balance yeah AI chatbot integration into the game no, we did to help people we actually we actually talked a bit a fair bit about this last stream if you want to check out the VOD, not this specific feature request but like AI in general not something we've considered I think using a service like this requires a lot of back end actually because when you're using the AI stuff it's actually running a lot of, stuff in the background so you can't really run it locally as far as I know at least not to the the scale of which those like popular services are, but it's like it's a cool idea actually like it would be nice to be able to like just type in like hey I want to make this many of this what do I need to do because there's definitely like an aspect of the game where it's confusing how to like, when you're learning how to play the game like all the math and that stuff can be quite like tricky to get into- I when I started playing satisfactory I just kind of just went on the planning websites and just like how do I build this and then I learned from that so it would be a cool like assist tool if anything but nothing like that plan at the moment
