> it's a question my friend has a green collar preset for all walls in the world it's kind of annoying is there a way to change this, no the the presets are, singleton so like there's one preset for all players i'm pretty sure so if if someone's changed the default color set then that will affect all the buildings in the world you can make more presets if you want to though
