> comes up maybe yep any idea where the sum of slope mesosphere or samurai said it would be actually implemented yep that will be implemented i'm pretty sure all of them will be implemented with story they're story related items um and story won't come until 1.0 of the game so the way i can sort of see it then is that they're probably just going to be these random things up until that point
