### Transcript

> I saw a question here that I'm trying to dig up again, are controller questions allowed like like you're allowed to ask any questions you want guys, but no you're banned so yeah accept control of questions yeah control question is the only exception, no but the the state of controller support is that, we initially had control of support when we were developing the game but the thing with it is that whenever you make changes you have to like also you know maintain everything all the dependencies around that and, control support was some of those things where we I guess we felt a bit limited in terms of like what we wanted to change with the game without having to learn anything like yeah but how do we make it work with controller so we kind of just like took a pause and control support and I don't know like if how when it will work in the future maybe we'll do a revamp of control support once the game is finished, but right now we don't really know because we don't like think too much about it I guess I know it would be great if we had control support for a lot of different reasons, but we don't have like, we will definitely do it or we like we don't know at this point we we will you know look we have it at the back of our heads but we haven't like really, looked into it well but but I think it's promising the fact that like people can make most of the game work with like, there's like the steam thing where you can like wrap controller support, and a lot of people say they managed to play the game just fine with that which sounds promising for us, I guess it's a bit unfortunate for you guys in the meantime that you have to use that but that is always an option but, it's it's it's a future thing we don't already know at this point yes but we we have heard, people requesting it for you know a variety of reasons people want to play on their tv or something or whatever but also, accessibility reasons yeah so like there is it's not like there's no interest in it it's just that like we just haven't really looked into it just yet but we are aware of, like the impact that it could have if we do do something with it so, yeah but you know feel free to keep focusing poking us about it that's okay, just want you to know that we have heard folks
