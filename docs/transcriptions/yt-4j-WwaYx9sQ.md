> what about the uranium fuel alt so yeah if I didn't say this before but every recipe that involves beacons are probably going to get changed, to not have beacons essentially, I've seen a lot of people speculate that like oh maybe they'll add something new no right now we don't have any plans to anything new to replace beacons with we're probably just going to rebalance how those recipes are I don't remember how many recipes we have that utilize beacons but it's like radar tower it's that alt recipe it's like explorer for the most part like just removing the beacon in most of these recipes we feel is enough I think but I can't I can't speak for certain because mark just started looking into this, so like it's it's actually too early for me to even speculate about that stuff, because I don't know yet
