> how bad are the lights in performance the lights are very performant, because they're not actually lights, we're probably gonna we're probably gonna talk more about how the lights work in the future because they're actually kind of magic, the implementation of them they're not actually lights lights they're they're kind of like, they're kind of like i i can't really like talk too much about it because i i haven't fully read up on it i only know like kind of how they work but i'm hoping we can make like a video or maybe have been on the stream or something like that talk about that at some point because it's really interesting it's really interesting i think you guys will find it interesting as well the yeah the lights are a lie like the that we would not have been able to make it as like performant if we wouldn't have done it the way they're implemented, they're holes in the sky yeah exactly so so we're talking we'll talk more about that eventually
