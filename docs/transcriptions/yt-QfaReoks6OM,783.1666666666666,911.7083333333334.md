### Transcript

> Oh, hey Snutt! I found the ball!
Should I play it where it lies? Let's just go to the next hole.
>
> [Inspirational music]
>
> Alright, dude. Last hole. And yeah, now that we've added
Signs it's a lot easier to keep track of the scorecard.
>
> [Fart sound, music ends]
>
> Oh, shit. Uh, well, it's no biggie.
I'm still ahead by a lot.
>
> [Inspirational music resumes]
>
> [Clean golf ball hit]
>
> I think I'm getting the hang of this.
>
> [Quirky, upbeat music begins]
>
> [varied assortment of expletives]
>
> Snutt, what's wrong? You're usually so calm and composed. It's just the comments, man. Like, I just got this
from Dark Angel 69, right? &quot;Factorio is a way better game
than Satisfactory. Snutt sucks.&quot;
[Quirky music stops] Folks...
>
> [Inspirational music begins]
>
> I know you all want me to win
for Dedicated Servers... but... at what cost? Not like this. Send Snutt some love! You know what? I'm
feeling a bit better here. I think I got this.
>
> [Golf ball hit]
>
> What the- chat stop! Too much! Easy there, grandpa! Alright Jace, even after my big mess up, it seems like you're still two strokes
behind from a tie. Which means you need to sink this to win. Wait, what happens if we tie? Well, I guess we won't add golf
or dedicated servers. Wait, what? There's no way we're going through
this whole rigmarole of having a bet or only to end
up not adding either of them..?
>
> [Music stops]
>
> [Epic music building]
