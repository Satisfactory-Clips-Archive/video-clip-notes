> roof trees respawning being worked on I'm not sure is that that's, I haven't heard of that one we actually had a meeting about that kind of the other day, we've had and so here's the thing guys this is way deeper than than you want this answer to be, we have ideas of rewriting the entire foliage system because we need to do that regardless because of how multiplayer right now is the the most expensive part of multiplayer right now are conveyor belts and the goddamn foliage for some reason and, we it's just not sustainable so we need to rewrite that whole system and we've been saying that for two years now because that system is humongous, and it's also a pain in the ass because it kind of works but not really and that's part of like the problem with the trees responding all the time and stuff like that is because the way it works, because it's not foolproof, or yeah there's some issues with it so yeah we will rework it work it when will that happen nobody wants to touch it with a 40-foot pole I was supposed to do it and then I became a community that tells you how much we don't want to rework that he literally quits his job gets a new job I'd rather get I'd rather be community manager than fix that wow
