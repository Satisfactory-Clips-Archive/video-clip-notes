> cool and one thing that i've noticed as well and maybe you can sort of talk about this is uh they're not flying they fly through the center points of the world grid right like they're like they don't cut across diagonal or anything like that yep so yeah they do yeah so they fly through the center and the reason for that is because it's kind of hard in the corners so if you build something right on the corner it wouldn't really have any time to get to the proper height um so we instead try to stay away from the corners as much as possible to give it as much space as possible to get up to the correct height when it's flying
