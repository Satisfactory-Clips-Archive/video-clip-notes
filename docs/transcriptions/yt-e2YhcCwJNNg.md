> blueprints would be awesome for late game that's also that this is highly debated uh internally like should we have blueprints or not um i personally believe that you know at some point we're gonna have some better solution for endgame um because it is tedious to build a lot of stuff albeit you know the the the debate is like that's part of the fun as well that it is a big cumbersome thing and you know like it's understandable the feeling that people you know get burned out on the game or like feel like you know end game is a hassle and whatnot and that's that's totally understandable and and it's like we don't expect people to be wanting to play this game like maybe in for infinity like or maybe we want i mean it's obviously it would be great if if we could make a game where people would feel like they want to play the game for infinity but you know like we're also you know at some point people are gonna hit a wall uh but yeah like if if not blueprints specifically first of all bloop we've blueprints are are technically difficult for us to implement that's one of the reasons why we haven't like really dived too much into it um but but i believe there's also a lot of stuff uh not specifically tied into blueprints per se but like things that can really improve building stuff you know like one really tedious thing is setting your recipes for every single building maybe there's a like just implementing that quality of life feature can really i think add a ton um there are there have been in the in the past like a lot of cases where like just adding a tiny quality of life feature completely changes like you know how how you build stuff like i remember before we had the mass dismantle feature like just adding being able to like mass dismantle stuff really improve the game so we have a lot of ideas on how to do that and we're probably gonna pursue those paths before we you know maybe go for a full-on blueprint implementation if we do because i think it's also the case of like if we start pursuing that and we notice that like oh now it's way better for for endgame and we still have you know the minecraft feel of yours you're still putting down every single thing on your own um so it's not impossible or maybe there are other solutions to it you know who knows um let's see here what else we got reverse mass dismantle i believe that's kind of what blueprints are
