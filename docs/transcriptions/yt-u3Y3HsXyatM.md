> here's one for you snit which one what does net what does network quality selector and options affect I have no idea no it is no no I know I'm just kidding there's an I don't want to work can I just go home yeah just go I'll carry you all right see you later all right anyway, no it's it's, it changes a lot of different settings, it has to do with, both like like bandwidth settings between client and server it's also bandwidth settings between server and client because they're calculated differently, it's just it's just like changes general network quality settings depending on your the reason why they exist is because depending on your like internet connection and how you're set up like if you're sitting behind more than one router or if you're you know that kind of stuff, then you can run into an issue where if you try to send too much bandwidth over your your network that you can't, process it then that's worse than being in the opposite where like you send less data than you can because you'll run into like overflow issues and that will just make that will kind of collect up and cause a lot of issues so that's why we set it low from the get go we are gonna increase that a little bit because we found, from feedback from players that the the in-game like bandwidth that we're using right now is a little bit low compared to like all the people playing our game, so we're going to up it a little bit but yeah generally it just increases the bandwidth is the it's a simple answer, if you want like a more direct like exactly what it does then check out unreal engines, what is it, unreal engine like there's no this is this is so annoying with this answer because there's no easy answer to like respond to this because it's complicated right and even when you explain it to someone who knows what I'm talking about, even then it's still complicated to explain it because there are so many factors to it because it's complex like network in general is very very very complex like I think it's downplayed how complex it is, in a lot of cases but check out unreal engines if you want like a more in depth of like what actually happens check out unreal engines like network
