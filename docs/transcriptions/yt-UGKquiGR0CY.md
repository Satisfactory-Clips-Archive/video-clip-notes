> okay so what about uh so about signs why are we waiting so long to add them because we you you've already said before that we will have signs we've said it but why are we waiting so long i have no clue there is your answer i think this is this is exactly why we brought mark on everybody he also doesn't know answers i think i think burke touched on this last time we were here when we uh when burke was also on the stream right yeah and i think he was also the one that said that he didn't see a version of satisfactory without science and i think that's kind of a common thing across the team like we we do want science because they're awesome and they would solve so many problems for just making everything more clear for the players themselves and they give them a lot of power and effect but i think during update 3 we actually plan to have them i think there was actually a ticket for for uh for dylan that might still be on the trello he worked on a tiny bit actually yeah i think he was on it but then we dropped it because i mean we had all this other stuff to do yeah pipes or something i don't think there's a toilet paper mod there's a toilet wait really toilet paper i don't know if that's true or not but jesus literally jesus is saying that literally jesus signs already assists on train stations yeah have you seen when people like take the save editor and they shrink down the train station and they use that as science mark it's amazing uh that's the most high poly count way to get a sign yeah yeah because that's that's like one of the reasons why we didn't finish implementing science is because uh the feature kind of uh bloated like we we've thought of more and more stuff to add and like we won't do this and this and this but also like performance with a big was a big thing so we didn't want to have like any transparency and stuff like that so we're like oh we don't have that and then people like [ __ ] it we'll just take the train station who cares about poly count just get them in there if you if you ever do that and complain about performance at the game you're dead to me but if the game runs better than mary jace yeah if it runs better somehow then yeah marry me
