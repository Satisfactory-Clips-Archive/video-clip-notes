> yeah early access any regrets no I don't think so no not really I can think of we certainly don't regret doing early access, yeah I don't think that I don't think I think if we had felt, like we wanted to, like finish it 1.0 and just release it whatever I don't think the game would be as good as it is now slash will be and I don't think we would have spent as much time because we would have been like well we don't know if you know because we wouldn't have known if it was like fiscally kind of like a good idea to keep working on the game or not right but after doing early access and seeing the amount of the support and interest that people have in the game that sort of tells us that yeah we are safe to continue to work on the game right so like if we didn't do early access we wouldn't have had that feedback and we would never have known if our game would have been good or not, and yeah and I think the game is turning out to be a better game than it would have been otherwise with with all of your help for sure yeah there's a lot like pipes wouldn't have happened if it weren't for early access like that was things yeah maybe yeah yeah it's true it's true
