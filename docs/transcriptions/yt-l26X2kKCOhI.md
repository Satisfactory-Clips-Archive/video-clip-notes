> will there be some tutorials for pipes or some simplified pipes game modes I always struggle with them even after watching YouTube tutorials, I think that's good feedback you can also provide that on our QA site questions.satisfactorygame.com I don't think we plan on making tutorials maybe we can at some point I mean it's not out of the question the problem is like there were really good tutorials on YouTube already I don't I don't know what we would do to provide you tutorials apart from like other stuff in game that we can maybe do yeah so so go like definitely leave that feedback on the QA side so that the rest of the team can see oh like you know people are still struggling with pipes or something like that, otherwise you can always go to the questions and help channel in, our on our Discord all right it's a form thing now we just talked about it actually yeah, and there are oftentimes people there who are kind enough to, help others out like I mean I saw someone help someone set up their first coal plant, just the other day actually they were just talking about it, so you know you can always go there and ask for people for specific feedback on your stuff if, the information that's out on the internet is not helping you yeah specifically because I guess there's there's because like satisfactory is that type of game where I don't think we can ever be able to like be explicit enough so that like you can learn everything from the game from the like everything in the game buy the game if that makes sense like there's always going to be the need for people to like reach out to others or check tutorials I think we've done a really good job though like we've we've done a lot of the heavy lifting I think yeah, but we can't account for literally everyone yeah and I have a feeling that we might want to like look at maybe the early you know tutorial stuff again at some point and see like is there anything we can improve here, yeah but we have spent a lot of time on that as well, when we were, closer release we spent a lot of time like trying to what like figure out the best first user experience sort of like path like people can understand a lot of game design decisions like also surround that I think, so, yeah it's a it's a it's a huge topic yeah yeah like we we've put so much time and effort into onboarding like this is a thing that has it's not like we did it once we've like gone through and workshopped the beginning of the game countless times and there's no doubt in my mind we'll probably end up doing it again before 1.0 yeah revisiting it so it's important and it's hard to get right it's really hard yeah really really for sure it's like literally the most important thing yeah but I think I wanted to get to as as well like I don't think we are ever going to be like clear enough that you will need to sort of seek out information outside of the game and I think it's going to help like helpful too because that sort of invites you into these communities where you can sort of learn more and like maybe maybe the game would like open up more to you by doing so, than than we anticipated so
