### Transcript

> is the game still fully funded yeah it's I mean it's always been fully funded otherwise we wouldn't have done it like the reason why I mean, I guess yeah technically the reason why we're in early access is because we couldn't like keep working on it, until we were fully down but I think there's there's another reason as well I think I think one of the main reasons why we put the game to early access is because we had one vision of what the game could be like right and we had, budget for that right and then at some point we we reached that point where like we don't have more budget, so we have to release the game at some point and which means that either we say okay this is the game we're done this is the things we're putting into it, and release it and, that would have been a lesser experience than if we were to put it in early access and keep developing on it while the game is available to people, I think that's the main reason because we weren't, we were self-funded when it came to satisfactory we didn't have like a publish or anything like that and we still don't, even though we got that exclusivity deal and that really helped us a lot too

> maybe if we maybe if we knew about the epic exclusivity deal before we were released in early access we would have kept working on the game maybe I don't know, and like not released it until it was done, but I think I honestly I kind of dig the the way we did early access and like how you guys have been incorporated in this because like a lot of feedback that goes into what the game is is from you guys so I think we would have missed out on a lot of stuff if we just would have released the game but I guess we would have kept working on the game if we were I don't know, but, yeah really my point with all of this though was that we've always had a the intention to release the game right to be in 1.0 we're not going to be in early access forever, that is that is still on plan or like in the plans right and I don't know exactly when that will happen I know that we've publicly written everywhere that we're hoping to get it out for 1.0 in like 2022 sometime, I don't know if that's gonna happen, maybe it will maybe it won't so we'll see might get delayed I mean it all comes down to like if we feel that it's finished once we reach 1.0 but at some point we kind of have to release the game in 1.0 because we can't keep working on this forever, that's just the way we feel we kind of want to move on and do other things as well sometime but I don't know when that is, compensating models early access it's been exemplary I think the way I always feel like I'm missing out because- I feel like the way we've done early access the way that I've seen a lot of games do early access and I've like yeah that's the way I want games to do early access I guess because that is that is the benefit of early access right let's let's not beat it on the bush the benefit of early access is really like like you guys get an opportunity to to play early and get get in on the the development state of the game right so you're getting access to the alpha version of the game essentially, and we get to keep working on the game, and, seeing like the state of things are I guess one very big caveat to early access games is that if a game in is in the situation we are where they feel that like we can't we can't make the game we want to make because we had don't have enough funding but if we put out the game on early access then we can get funding while we're working on the game we want to make instead of the game that we can make right but you can end up in a situation where maybe the game doesn't sell well enough in early access so you can't make that game you wanted to do and I guess that's why you get those situations where, games kind of like make a bad rep in early access because you know they don't deliver what they want to do because they didn't sell enough in early access or something like that I don't know there's also like the the tricky ones that are like just put in early access and then we make money or whatever but I think I don't think a lot of games have that like even though that feels that way I think that's really rare actually, and I think the type of developers that do that it's kind of obvious that they do that
