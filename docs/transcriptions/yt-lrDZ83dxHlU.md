### Transcript

> coming late fee disrupted seven crash when deleting things crashing when Landing your mobs out of spawning, I haven't heard too much about that personally, if you were sending the crash reports in then at least the team will get a log of this crashes occurring but if you haven't, also done a QA site post then I recommend that you go to the QA site questions.satisfactorygame.com and you let us know there so that we can fix those crashes
