> what about actual harbor and shipping we don't really want to do, aquatic stuff no because we, we sort of we sort of I think in a way we sort of rely on the water to be a boundary for the game and if we give you the opportunity to navigate that boundary like then it can't just be a boundary anymore like there needs to be we have to do something with it and that's not really in our plans so like it's not as it's not as simple as just adding a ship and a shipping dock, to the game like we would have to do more to justify the existence of it and give it a place in the game so it's actually a lot that's a lot of work to do something like that and then if you have add like a shipping container or whatever then you know why is the wall like why is there no aquatic life like it doesn't make sense like so that just adds more work on top of that too
