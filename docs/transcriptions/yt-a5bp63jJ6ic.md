> thoughts about making nuclear energy more complex I don't know if we are going to do that I think we're pretty happy with the complexity of nuclear stuff because I think like when we added update 4 I think that was the whole point of that was that we wanted to do like yeah exactly more complex like- I think we're pretty happy with the complexity that we have, with with tier seven and eight, so I don't think I don't think like the things that keep us awake at night is like oh the game's not complex enough I think we rather want to like work on things that we've sort of felt were lackluster, for the game so you know things like the equipment system maybe in like exploration and that kind of stuff is or things that I think we would rather focus on, they're rather than like adding a bunch of new tools and parts and features and make the game more complex, because because the way that we've kind of worked on the game up until this point has been that we've kind of like focused on like the factory aspect of the game yes I think that I think that is correct, and then you know we've we've sort of like finished that as far as we can and then now we're kind of going to grab up with the other stuff in the game so like ux and and everything else that are related to that, so you know people always mention like oh you're going to add tier 9 or whatever like there's

> there's no real incentive for us to like go more tears we can always add more tears I guess but I think we should we also want to focus on like finding the sweets like the middle ground too was like you know where do people find the game too complex where are people dropping off and like improve those parts of the game, and, you know maybe a lot of people feel like like the end game is too grindy that's maybe something we would you know wrap up too but yeah no no guarantees that like we'll just like add more tears and keep going like add more complexity because, we want to give people options we don't want you to feel that you have to go through everything which I guess like nuclear isn't like mandatory to finish the game right but yes
