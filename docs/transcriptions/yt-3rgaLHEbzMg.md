> um train collision is coming does that mean that trains will collide with terrain and buildings like trucks do or will they check conclusion without the trains i guess uh well the check collision with other trains that's for sure i don't know how it's gonna work with the other other things i don't think it's gonna change too much this is me spitballing though uh but it but it feels like we're probably not gonna change that aspect because it's the same thing with like the conveyor belt stuff right if you if it bothers you that the train collides with stuff then you won't build that way um yeah that's true i think if you don't care if you don't mind your train coming out of the ground yeah exactly then we'll let you just do that um because it's the same thing with conveyor belts like you can build conveyables through the terrain in certain situations uh we only check really on the pulse collision um so uh but maybe we'll change that in the future i don't know yeah and having collision between trains on a track is is is a different thing to to collision with um the world in terms of gameplay because that that actually just changes sort of like the gameplay element of how train tracks work and how you're supposed to plan them as opposed to um limiting whether you can put a train track in this place or a place that's like just a few units over so that it doesn't clip um yeah if that makes any sense i don't think i explained it well whatever
