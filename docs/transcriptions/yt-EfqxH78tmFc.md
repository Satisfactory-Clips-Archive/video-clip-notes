> is the team thinking patch 4.0 release of 2022 a lot of people asking about one 1.0 were released today more so than usual, but the answer is, we're not saying the answer we have some ideas of whether it's going to come out this year next year the year after whatever yeah, but we're not saying anything because, you know I think four years ago we had we had we had a plan that it was going to come out three years ago like legit and we were wrong right I mean- I think whatever plan we have now is a much better plan than that and more sure but my point is that it can change so we don't we're not at a point right now where we can give those plans out to the public because then people will have their expectations set to a certain thing that honestly we're not even sure if we're definitely going to get it or not so there's no point saying it if there is not, if there's not going to be any like we're not even sure if we can follow up at all so yeah maybe it comes out tomorrow who knows exactly bet you'll be really surprised if that happens
