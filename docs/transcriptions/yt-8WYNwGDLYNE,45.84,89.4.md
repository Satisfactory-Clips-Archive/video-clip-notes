> okay did I do this no never look at the cow kiss my name is Hana Hana boofer if you pronounce it the Dutch way I work mostly in level design and I also do some writing but mostly I make trees and rocks look nice together I am I'm currently the only level designer in the company but we used to be with to Gustav who left recently I learned a lot from him and now I'm taking over so that's very exciting and also very frightening no I'm solely in charge of both the world and the story it's cool I'm good don't leave I pretty much started with level design when I started studying game design that's cool and I had no idea what it was at first and then I immediately discovered I liked making digital worlds I guess also making them pretty which was a problem at first because I didn't make them functional but I got there eventually and you know I've always been walking around with worlds in my head and now I just actually make them which is pretty cool as a level designer do you place enemy spawns no resource no nope lizard doggers mm-hmm why do we pay you my looks obviously that's what we to pay you it is the low salary out of anybody so level design can be many things but specifically what I do here is maybe better explained as world design or world building I like to sort of build more in layers so I first do okay what kind of landscape are we looking at like are we having a lot of mountainous area is it more flat lands is there a lot of water so erosion rivers etc so I'd go for the big stuff like cliffs and water and landscaping and then I figure out what kind of landscape material we need so then I do another passive painting and that usually also introduces more detail in the landscaping that I do and so I just go over an area layer by layer by layer and then eventually but last layer is added and hopefully it works how does it feel when you get feedback from the community about little bugs oh yeah yeah I was like god dammit we miss the spot again mostly that the world's huge and you know we're not we're not machine so we miss spots all the time and if it's an area that we're gonna rebuild anyway then I'm like oh do it later trying to make a world stay interesting well we have a very limited set of assets and also it's because it's so big and we're hand making everything is very easy to lose oversight and to lose sight of what's good sometimes I'm just placing the same cliffs for a week or the same trees for a week or going over an area 50 times just to purge and rebuild and purge and rebuild when you're placing your mm rock does it look good you don't know anymore you have no clue it's it's hard sometimes to keep focus the map is dividing in tiles which allows us to edit these tiles separately so that way the landscape is split so we can work one person per tile essentially and then we have some levels that are essentially invisible and they go over it like like a little other layer that usually contained the gameplay stuff we can work on tiles well at the same time gameplay can be added on top of that in level so here you can see the exploration level is loaded and there's a slug and a creature spawn point in it and they will disappear if I unload the level and when I load it back in they will reappear again there you go the employee level design and more aesthetic level design I guess that's how you could separate it is that we we we look at the purpose of an area is this meant to be early game a large building area does it mean to have a lot of open spaces we take that into account is it more an endgame area does it mean more obstacles is more difficult than we tend to make it difficult to navigate to traverse etc so we can we can start with the the big stuff like that we just start building and then occasionally I maybe of like oh this would be like a cool arena type thing for for enemies or whatever we make stuff and then the gameplay level designers have to sort of like it's right it's right or make it work I don't think any area and the game is done right now specifically right now we're really taking a look at okay what do we need for it to be done and there's quite a lot of plans still drawing that line of when is it done is so difficult and you really have to sort of just really look at like what is the experience we're planning to give what is the style we have and stick to that as much as we can we're not building the most hype realistic world simulator here so we can get away with some things we're building a certain experience and that's always something I have to keep in mind like you know don't go too far so what Socrates well years on the real engine and I use Photoshop and I use pink this thing called pigment map where we can paint this this canvas essentially which we then project over the level which can edit colors of assets so basically we can make sure that there you know we just have the one green grass asset and then if we lay over the pigment map we can actually make you know grass look more yellowish and dry in certain spots without actually having to make a new asset so it's a lot cheaper to do that why do you and Jace wear the same clothes okay do you do anything else other than level designer writing uh I did some VFX at some point but that's about it I also I know chase a lot no I don't so this is a formal apology to all players that are played in errors of the map that we've been working on because you know we add new clips sometimes and we add new trees sometimes and sometimes we forget to enable collision or disable collision and then they just pop up in their game and blocks everything so that's totally our fault it's not just me I so I'm totally blaming me our team too it's throwing him under the bus we try to minimize like damage to player bases as much as possible of course like we don't want to ruin people's games because people are making super awesome and we don't want to actually ruin that especially not with indestructible missha's adding that to level is you know kind of a douchebag moves they're trained not to do it but sometimes an area is so unfinished or so broken and people have built into it we just can't not do it this coffee stain your first job in the game industry caffeine is definitely my first job in industry it's not my first I interned at Ubisoft before but it's it's it's you know it's really way different to actually work somewhere so this is my first job and I feel like I'm getting real biased I don't want to leave anymore man no yeah I feel like everything after this just downhill goodbye and thank you for watching this week's episode of gay or nay just every person in the office myself is that more flat back there yeah yeah most things studios
