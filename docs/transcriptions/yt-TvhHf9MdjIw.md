### Transcript

> so i'm telling you about adding more music to the game uh i i actually don't know the status of adding more music the thing is i think it makes sense because i know that like you know a lot of people have been asking about a soundtrack if we can release like an ost or something one of the reasons why we haven't wanted to do it is um yet at least i mean i think it's something we want to do but one of the reasons why we haven't done it yet is because we also don't have a complete ost is one of the things that we were thinking so it's very likely that we're gonna be adding more music in the future
