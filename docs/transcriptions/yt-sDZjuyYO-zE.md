> no good what's your favorite part of level design favorite part of level design oof I think when we like when we get down to to building an area for the first time and it's really that whole trying to establish what kind of biome we're going for and like the assets we need and it's just very interesting to like I don't know create this part of a world from scratch it's very interesting because it's very creative, and it's also yeah trying to use assets that we already have in different ways so it's sort of like this breath of fresh air in a sense as well which is nice I like that a lot is it is it hard to sort of like zoom out and be like wow look at this world that I made because you must be like so I know this part yeah it's like because like I feel like when you when you've got a task it must just be so easy to ignore everything outside of it you need to yeah yeah yeah it's like I'm working on this one area like the rest of the map is just yeah you know but it's usually when I when I play the game I sort of really it's a re-experience it in a different perspective because I'm used to just flying through and seeing everything from like a a big perspective and then I suddenly get down to like I'm small and I have to survive in this world and it's this completely different experience of the world I've built and just flying around yeah and it makes me experience things in a different way and it's it's nice because I like sometimes I find like nooks and crannies is like oh I forgot how did I make this yeah it's nice that's the same even with me with programming someone's like hey jace you made this thing right I'm like oh turns out I did I get that as well
