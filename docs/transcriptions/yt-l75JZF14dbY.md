> for that one I'd like that specific use case I don't think so because I like we would have to change the hitbox quite significantly, where like it would make sense in that use case but a lot of other use cases it wouldn't make sense but there is a oh actually we might change the power poles to be soft clearance not sure if that's true or not, but something just caught my eye here it's possible we might change that actually to soft clearance instead, don't quote me on this though but because I might be wrong but a little birdie whispered in my ears
