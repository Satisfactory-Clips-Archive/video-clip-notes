> when you have 200 000 foundation also be good too yeah it would improve in that sense I mean it would improve, another issue with that it's not optic count but it's a our hierarchical, scene occlusion system or on reels the more objects you have to loop through to test occlusion with the better so they would also improve on that sense but it would also make, what's it called like when you're if you're looking at like the edge of that composition or whatever, it will need to render the whole thing so we do lose out a bit of that but I think it's always like all these things when you do optimization it's always like a [ __ ] trade-off for everything so like yeah this thing will improve this thing but it will also make this thing worse there's like never any like solid like this is what you should do and it will fix everything let's say I'd say there's a fair trade-off, it depends because like if the if the game is gpu bound then that wouldn't change anything if if the game is cpu bound that would change anything so like you can't you win some you lose some right so it depends some people are having, struggles with the game being rendering heavy some people are struggling with the game being cpu and heavy, so like I guess the the way for us is just add more tools to people so like if you knew know how to like optimize then you'll have the option to like configure it sort of so, yeah
