### Transcript

> that i want to show off today is another major change coming to the build system and that is a new feature called zooping so what is zooping so if we build foundations we usually build them one by one right but we've added zooping as an as an optional build mode now so if you hold r you can switch to zoop and what zoop does is it allows you to zoom you can mass construct foundations zoop there we are you can also do a you can also zoop with like walls for example now you can't zoom with everything all right you can only you can only zoop it like walls and foundations um you can't zoom like constructors or manufacturing buildings and things like that uh you can only go up to 10 at a time and you can only do it in one dimension so a lot of people are probably already commenting this is smart mod they're adding smart mod we're not adding smart mods smart mod is a very popular uh mod that people use for satisfactory it's like a building enhancement mod gives you all the tools in the universe yeah so this is not that mod this is just limited to 10 pieces at a time just uh foundations and walls and some other sort of decorative things only in one dimension yeah so for the longest time we've sort of pushed back on uh any sort of mass construction we felt that the game didn't really need it but we're not we're now at a point where we feel you know a lot of people want it and we sort of see uh you know that there's actually a lot of good reasons to have um even just this out level of uh mass construction you know we think it will go a long way make a lot of people happy make things a little easier help out a lot of people with accessibility issues too sometimes the clicking is a little bit too much physically for some people so we think that uh zooping should uh you know help the average player quite a bit so uh we're pretty excited to put this in the game to finally give it to y'all and i hope you're looking forward to um to using it honestly hopefully this will help you out a lot in the future if you think zooping will help you please leave a thanks jace helps a lot in the comments below so we know okay so that's pretty much all i want to show off today
