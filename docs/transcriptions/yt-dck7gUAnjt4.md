> another, are other things that currently clip in the game going to change other than trains, i don't know i don't think so i don't think there's like even with trains i'm not even sure how the clipping works there like i don't know if they're gonna start clipping with terrain or if they're only gonna be colliding with each other i'm not really sure, there will be some changes to how building works so there might be some like you know oddities kind of here and there change but i don't think i don't think we have this like massive movement when it comes to objects clipping that we feel that we need to address it because most people, if they if they don't want things to clip they'll just build it so they don't clip and they don't want things to look ugly and they just won't build it that way and some people who don't mind things clipping they can just play the way they like to play so like i don't think there's like any sort of like incentive for us right now to do any overhauls to how things clip or don't clip yeah
