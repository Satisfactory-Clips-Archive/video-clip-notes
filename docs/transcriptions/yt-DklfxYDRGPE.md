### Transcript

> all right let's jump into some state of Dev I think a lot of people are, Curious what's gonna happen here and I have to do this manual again because the stream deck doesn't work super annoying oh yeah that is actually really annoying today yeah God voice meter always doing this to me all right so state of Dev I'm pretty sure like a lot of people are curious as to what's going on with update seven I mean that's probably you know, I mean that is the thing that we're working on at the moment and that is the thing that is coming out soon ish we announced, two weeks ago I think that we are planning to release it this year and that is still sort of the plan hopefully question mark yeah hopefully we hope that it is, we are going to be announcing when it will be available on experimental, this week so yeah not today though but but soon I'll do it do it Chase give me a date wait do we have huh wait I gotta go to the wiki before you do this I'm curious yeah do we have any entries on the wiki I don't know what you do for update seven that's that's what I'm curious about because the thing that that was for update six, it'll be okay November 31st November 31 or 31st very nice that's that's that's my birthday calendar there's always someone whenever we say any date that's always like it's my birthday November 31st 2020, two, update seven get ready oh there you go that was actually the only yeah there was no like other dates on the wiki exactly it's calculated yeah oh wait another word February 31st 2069. February 31st was that on there yep nice good one there's another one that just says Natalie's birthday look forward to it yeah very nice let's hope you worry 33rd very nice, but we are working on on, like finalizing stuff, so we're not like too far away, there's been, what do you call it like it's like stuff's coming together and there's like constantly we're constantly shifting back and forth between like different decisions, like for instance the overclocking thing, like Mark actually messaged me like the other week and he was like oh I think we're gonna do it this way and that was like right after I made that video where we talked about stuff and I was like oh cool and then I'll just put that in the next video and then Mark messaged me again like ah maybe we're not gonna do it that way though so like man I don't know, it might be like a last second thing where we decide what we do with overclocking or not for update seven but we have decided that we are changing how power generators overclocking works for those, so that's the like the only thing that's for sure decided if anything one of the cool things is I think we've done a decent job of like you know like when we're not sure about stuff we just like let you guys know and I know it's like kind of disappointing in some cases where it's like you should know what you're doing but we're just people and we don't know what we're doing and it's cool that you guys for the most part know that and we can just be open that we don't really know so the reality is when it comes to that thing maybe, maybe we figured out when update seven drops maybe we figure out after update seven drops who knows yes, but you know we're just gonna do whatever we think is best, and if we can figure it out early we will if we can't then we found is what it is and, but we all just want a good game anyway so just work towards that maybe we'll get there by now yes either you support us or you give up on us one of the two I'm not sure yeah, yeah just just, what's the just, step into a time machine and go into future like 20 2069. yeah yeah yeah and then go back and let us know what to do yeah yeah yeah is it out yet no damn it God damn it yeah it's like the South Park episode where Kirkman freezes and stuff because he can't wait for the switch no it's not the switch is it the switch no it's the [ __ ] Wii God I feel old now dude when did the Wii come out oh dude that was so long ago like over 10 years we've been like 15 years God damn it have you seen the meme with like, 2006 right yeah oh God damn it you've seen the meme with like, what retro games what we think retco games from 20 years look like and then I've posted that I mean a bunch of times yeah and what it actually looks like in this like Final Fantasy 10. yeah you're talking about actually my meme oh did you make that I made that one with the final visit 10 yeah hell yeah what was it it was like, Zelda or something or like this is what we thought games look like like into the past or something but they actually quite funny that's crazy but there's more for state of Dev it sure is, if you've been active on our Discord you may have noticed that we've changed a few things, everyone's been banned it's an emote only mode that would be actually pretty funny like as an April Fool's thing you're all bad you're all bad well I was gonna say the all emotes thing but the bandits were pretty good too yeah just kick everyone yeah we just start it's just the purge we're starting from scratch yeah no okay so like, a couple changes so one change that we've made guys is, we've always had this, questions and help Channel, and people can go in there ask questions if they have any help and people help them out it's great, we're now currently trialling the Forum format for that channel so people now, if you you know if you're on a Discord you can check it out, you click on that channel and there's a like a bunch of forum posts with titles like you would see in any other form and when you open one of them up it opens up like a Discord chat for that topic only, and then you can just create your own new post if you want so you know if you have a specific issue with something you just write a title start a post you can have like tags for what it's relevant to and then you just talk about people, that issue with people, in in one little thing so it should hopefully make it a little easier to find, questions that have been asked before because I think as you start typing a new post it can also search for like posts that might be relevant so that you can just go to those instead of creating new ones and then it can also help people stay on track with, with, the topic at hand because there'd be this other issue before in the old Christians help Channel where you would ask a question and then someone else will ask a question and then people would help that other person and then your question has been buried and you can't you're not gonna get seen right so this forum format really really fights against that so we're trying on that right now so if you're on the Discord, you know if you have any questions do check that out or consider helping people in the question help forums as well for sure I realized that like it might feel jarring because like change I don't like change, but like Jay said it's it's we're trying that like if you don't try try stuff out then you don't know if it's like better or worse or whatever so yeah and and we still have like the old channels just locked you know if this is complete trash I'm gonna like it we can always go back but the the whole, visibility on your own question, has been like a massive pain Point Forever on Discord like always especially for this kind of thing, so we think that even though it looks a little different it might be like a little bit confusing at first, we think that that's probably a worthy trade-off, the fact that people can actually just have their topic just be in one post and everyone can stay on topic and focus on it so hopefully that helps yes, and then you know we had tried threads before actually as well which we also used to try and combat this issue but it really wasn't used as much yeah kind of counter-intuitive especially when you need to find your threads sometimes oh well it sometimes pops out I don't know it's kind of weird but this this should this should help yeah because threads get archived and like it's hard to find them and at least here you can search there's like somewhat of a search functionality and I realized that we do have like the same forms as well like the our steam forms also has like this sort of form like formal Forum format, same deal there but I think there's like different people, hang out on a steam form some people different people hang on our Discord so yeah I think I think the steamforms for the most part are probably the better place to go because then that stuff even appears on Google and stuff like that as well right so like actually if you if you want to ask for questions and help steamforms is probably the best place to go but if you're already on the Discord and you just want to ask your question on the Discord, The Forum is hopefully a better format for that now yeah, we also have made another change, so, previously you know like if you ever have any issues on Discord there's like whatever the issue can be if there's like people misbehaving or whatever you know you could always ping a moderator right and you could still do that but we've also added this ability to, Open tickets so there's a channel now on a Discord called like, hashtag open a ticket, it's a little bit up on the on the thing, and there you can actually just create a ticket which which creates a a separate Channel between you, us and the moderators and you can just let us know what's up there so like if you have any concerns but you don't want to talk about it publicly in a channel you can do that through the open a ticket channel one thing that I want to mention though is this is not a place to, request features or report bugs bugs can be reported on the QA site questions.satisfactorygame.com, and, but that thing is supposed to be for Discord specific moderation issues or requests for the Discord, so try and keep it related to that because you're not going to get you're gonna get help for game related stuff, yeah and to some degree as well like even on the books and Forum, a bit bugs bugs and questions, Forum like it's not the place to report issues to us it's like a it's a place to discuss bugs around the game so if you want to report bugs to us you go to the Q8 site questions.satisfactorygame.com, and that goes to the team not just us it goes yes everyone exactly yeah, but they're still nice to be able to discuss around because like there are workarounds for a lot of things and you know if everyone try to message us about like Hey how do I fix blah blah, we would be very more more swamp than we are already, so it's a good place for you guys to to help each other out because there are a lot of workarounds for a lot of these issues, a lot of times when we're when we're prioritizing different issues and bugs that we're trying to fix we have a fixed voice meter you can't it's impossible yeah, a lot of times when we prioritize like what bugs to work on and like what issues to work on we look at like okay is this a show stopper for a lot of people and is there a workaround and like if there's a workaround that's not to say that like oh then we don't have to care about it obviously we need to fix it at some point, but sometimes when the workaround is like obvious then we can like decide on on fixing like a crash that like happens for you know the majority of people that there is nothing you can do about it, so that helps our prioritization a little bit at least but it's not definitely not like the, it's not like we're giving up on issues just because like oh no you can just dismantle it and then it'll work again don't worry about it like yeah that's what we sound like so yeah is that it for state of depth I think so, let me check if there's anything else outside of my notes Here why is this still open save, lost tab Swedish yes you know bus ticket bus ticket no it says QA what are you talking about, the first question what's after QA it's nothing I don't know what you're talking about no big deal is there anything else I feel like I always feel like I'm forgetting something but maybe that's just because I always forget you can always talk about it next week deal I like the way you think all right if you've got something we could tweet about it I don't know yeah okay
