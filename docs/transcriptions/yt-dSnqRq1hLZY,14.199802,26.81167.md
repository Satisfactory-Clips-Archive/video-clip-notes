> boom hell yeah bro hey everybody my name's snoot i'm one of the community managers here at coffee studios and you're watching a video that i'm in isn't that exciting anyway so if you didn't know last week we launched our very first lineup of official merch with our buddies over at four fans by fans and if you want to check that out you can click like the little thingy annotation thingy in the corner here maybe but today's video is going to be more about merge but before we get into that i just want to address some things related to update 4 and dedicated servers because i'm getting a lot of questions about these two uh and i just want to give you a quick update on the update a lot of people have been asking when we think update 4 will be coming out and we've not been able to give like a good answer because we don't really have a good answer really we still works towards like the mantra that like it'll be done when it's done and we can only really like speculate as to how much time like it will really take so we can't give like any definite dates until we feel confident enough that we can meet them and jayce kind of talked a little bit on this topic in a previous video that you can check out here what we can say at this point though is that it's probably not going to happen until early 2021. i know that sucks but in between now and then we're planning on releasing kind of like a minor update to the game so it'd be like you know something in between update three and four um so yeah you can expect that sometime maybe early november that will contain you know a bunch of bug fixes some optimization maybe some quality of life features and and an update to fluids in the game uh how mysterious so anyway you can look forward to that so regarding dedicated servers we've decided to prioritize that a bit more going forward we've been working on dedicated service since forever and dedicated server support is still like its own thing so it isn't bundled with like update four or anything like that uh but rather it will it will be it's you know it will be available at its own thing um albeit we don't really have a good time estimate on that yet um but uh all right so let's talk about merch all right super stoked that so many were hyped for merch last week a couple of things i'll address real quick uh some questions i've been getting that i want to clear up so where's the mug so we unfortunately haven't finalized production on the mug just yet it's something that we're gonna roll out further down the line why is shipping so expensive so four fans by fans is based in the us which means that yeah shipping is favorable for people in the us which sucks for everyone else we are looking into other alternatives from non-us peeps but uh we don't really have anything ready just yet did coffee stain become sellouts hell yeah are there any more designs coming well funny you should ask that i mean it's not because i picked all the questions but for fans by fans is something has something that's called four fan job four fans by fans has something that's called fan forge so fan forge is kind of like an open gallery for anyone to submit their designs and ideas for merch for the game and those designs will be shared and rated by the community so there's a chance that those designs will become like actual merch that we can sell on for fans by fans website or through wholesale or at conventions i mean whenever conventions happen again so essentially you can submit your own designs and we'll kick this off by hosting like a competition where we'll pick our favorite designs and one winner will receive like some exclusive goodies signed by the dev team and if you want to participate in this make sure that you design something that's original that's inspired by satisfactory that you're 18 years or older or have guardian consent and that you do not submit mashups or crossovers and that you do not use any copyrighted third party or anything overly lewd or otherwise inappropriate material so the competition starts right now and the final day for submission is october 8th
