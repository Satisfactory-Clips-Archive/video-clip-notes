> how long do you think the game will be supported so the game will definitely be supported until we release it 1.0 that's that's for certain, we don't know when we'll be done with 1.0, that might take several years, it might not be until 22 it might not be until 23. we don't know, coffee stain has this like like we prioritize feeling good about the stuff we release rather than just releasing stuff that's why we always delay stuff we don't want to release stuff until we feel like it's good enough we'd rather do the delay and I know it sucks for everyone but we'd rather delay stuff than put out stuff that we don't feel comfortable putting out and that's the same case that's the case for 1.0 we don't want to like say like okay it's good enough I guess like we have a vision for 1.0 and we want to work towards that, and you know some things are kind of decided like this is like here's stuff that we feel like this should be in the game, and some stuff is still like kind of up for grabs or like maybe we won't implement it or you know like we don't know how far we'll go with feature creeping and such, but like at some point the game is gonna be done like we're gonna reach 1.0 and we don't quite know what's gonna happen after that, we have some ideas for like dlc maybe or like we don't know what we'll do or maybe we'll just make free updates, not decided at all, because we'll cross that bridge when we get to it right there's still so much work left for for 1.0, so like just thinking about like what happens past one point it's kind of scary for us right now, so yeah
