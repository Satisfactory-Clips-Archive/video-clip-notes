> rework of inventory and removal of op inventory so we won't remove any inventory I think there's a little bit of like, maybe confusion around some of the comments around that because we've always said that like the combination of Blade Runners and jetpack is op which I mean it is but it's not bad that it's op, it's it's it's like considered late late game kind of equipment, if anything what we would like to do is make it so that you can maybe unlock like the jetpack a bit earlier maybe and then you know use like package fuel sorry use like turbo fuel maybe for the the current state of the jetpack and then maybe use like the the package fuel for like a worse version of the jetpack that you can get earlier or something like that, I don't know that's that's one idea that Mark is thrown out there, so we'll see but but I don't I don't think we will remove like any equipment in the state that it is right now, we'll probably just like add a lower tier or something like that
