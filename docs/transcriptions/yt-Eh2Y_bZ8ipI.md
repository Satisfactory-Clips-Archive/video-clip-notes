> have you accidentally started drawing something from like, from, another project or in this project but it was accidentally in the style of another project that, and you just didn't realize it at first so you basically started stealing an idea without realizing it, oh let me think, I don't think so I try to I try to be smart when I steal ideas whoa no shame no I don't want to be part of this everybody knows let me explain that let me explain that, there are no new ideas, ideas are essentially all your ideas are based on on influences from whatever from movies games music your private life nature whatever so you compile influences that you have into a new idea so you reassemble stuff there's nothing new inherently new you re reassemble stuff so every time I look into stuff I reassemble stuff that I know from from other sources and try to compile it into something new so- I think I'm I'm by now I'm I'm I think I'm capable of, smartly disassembling stuff, that I remember and reassembling it into something new, so no I don't like I hate when people just steal ideas but every idea is so to speak stolen in, like I think that's the I think that's the real pro approach I think that's just the reality of it man I mean I agree with you yeah so yeah, so but but no I, a great artist yeah well they do I was going to be like, yeah the interest and expression spoken by torsten does not reflect so a really really important thing really important creative advice I would give is if you want to create something for a game design something for a game don't look into other games look into whatever other source you have for example if you want to create like a a controller for your have a pack don't look into any other controllers in game like sci-fi controllers that other games did look into like joysticks from the 1980s look into power tools look into all that kind of sword understand how that functions and then create your own version, and it can be crazy and weird but then you can create your own version which is based on something else but don't look into what other people already refined because then it's gonna suck right because then it's gonna be a copy so don't do it I think it's a pretty good advice
