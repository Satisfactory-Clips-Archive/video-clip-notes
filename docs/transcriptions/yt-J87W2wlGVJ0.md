### Transcript

> and I have to say that we first of all we are working on the ui with the great team we have at coffee stand studios like nathalie ponce's they're amazing and whenever, I come to them with the something like this like your ui is fantastic but you know our translations especially german translations are breaking it because german has this long-ass words that that break every ui in the world and we usually find a solution to somehow make it flexible or give it more space and of course we weren't able to remake all the ui in the game because that's a lot of work but at least the new stuff that's coming out is ready for localization and we are remaking some older stuff that's pretty sweet because that's example I got is for the sorry now go go shoot for the pipeline we got a recently decided to change the maximum flow rate for pipeline we just decided to chop maximum down to max so it fits again and that was kind of an okay compromise nice yeah that's one of those compromises you have to do localization a lot because sometimes we can make the ui flexible to give it more space but sometimes it will kind of break the whole thing because you know there's a different problem with hieroglyphic languages like chinese and japanese because in those languages the ui might feel empty because they are much harder sometimes more dense right most most of the times so like a huge phrase might be translated like a huge phrase of like 10 words might be translated into like 15 symbols so if you have a lot of space for this it's going to look empty so it's not that simple just making everything big so in those cases do you know if like do they try and expand upon it so that it fills up the space or or just leave it do you know no no I don't think anybody tries to just make it longer for the sake of making it feel the ui but it's our job to make it look nice in all languages really cool
