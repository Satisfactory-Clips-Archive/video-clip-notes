> i'm just going to jump to cheat creek i can't remember there was something in between there i wanted to talk about but i completely forgot about it there's a there was a bug in in in in satisfactory that a lot of people really liked and those that even had a name it was called the cheek crate where some of the ran even i think all ramped foundations actually didn't have any collision to them and, that was that was fixed by us but we didn't even realize that we did so, well i sound like total eclipse now is it the

> hi guys it's me snoot today welcome to it's the best total impression i can ever make hi everybody, no sorry i got really derailed there what we're gonna talk about yeah so we we fixed the cheat crate thing was this which is a bug where some of the slope foundations didn't have like any blocking or any collision to them and that was i mean we first of all we half knew about that issue but we didn't like set out to fix it or anything like that but we, we fixed it like for some in some way we didn't even know that we did and a lot of people got upset because the cheat creed that was used for a lot of the like stacking, the splitters and like mergers and stuff and if you're making tight builds you can use the foundations to like get ramps up and stuff like that so it was, a lot of people used it for various building needs and was now since we've up to four we fixed that bug a lot of people had issues building the way they used to because of that bug and that is unfortunate yeah they use it as scaffolding essentially and that's a bit unfortunate and that's also not something that we really are fans of ourselves the fact that we are we don't want to like move forward and limit you guys we want to move forward and make things better we don't want it to be the case where when we put it put out updates we're limiting your creativity and, but the problem also is that the the foundations need collision because otherwise it's going to be weird we think or rather we don't like that approach rather but we really want you to be able to do the things you do so for the solution we have currently is that we're going to reintroduce that bug i think that, introduction of that bug will come back in the patch that's coming soon i don't think there's a patch today but maybe tomorrow, if i remember correctly so in that i think in in one of the next coming patches we're going to reintroduce that bug so that you can keep using the cheat crate for now and then in the future we're going to look into solutions to that problem that you guys are having so we don't know exactly what that solution is because it's a it's it's kind of like a difficult problem to solve right now, so we're going to look into solutions maybe we'll add some kind of like scaffolding material or something that you can use or some like weird other yeah scaffolding foundations or we we do a whole revamp of the whole collision for for buildings in general and making just so you can build tighter i don't know exactly what the solution is going to be but we have plans on improving the building in general so it kind of like fits into that but that's not coming up before that's in one of the future updates so yeah it's yeah it's a feature until it's fixed essentially
