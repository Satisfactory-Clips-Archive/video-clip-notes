### Transcript

> had there been difficulties or challenges to having your game available on different platforms are there, ideas that you've had to scrap because it wouldn't cross all the different storefronts, yeah I mean there's been like a there's a little bit of like conscious effort that needs to go into maintaining it but I think for the most part it has been reasonably pain-free from my understanding especially since we use, egs's or epic games is, what's it called on Epic online EOS EOS epic online services, and so that sort of simplifies things a lot so, so steam goes through epics Network stuff and everything goes through their Network stuff and then everything just kind of works from there there was some headache stuff there's definitely some headaches, with the cross-platform nature but, at the end of the day it works pretty well as for ideas that we have to scrap because of it I don't think we've done that yet I think one one unfortunate thing that like this is kind of a roadblock and that maybe we wouldn't pursue because of this is like Steam Workshop I don't know if we would pursue Steam Workshop maybe we will I don't know but there's a good reason to not pursue theme Workshop if our game is going to be on other platforms too, and that's because we would prefer Solutions where all of our mods can be accessible or easily found to everyone if the game was available on Steam Workshop and people only made Monster Steam Workshop then it's like everyone else gets kind of screwed so I don't know but then at the same time I don't really know if this is a problem anymore given the way that like mods have developed by the been developed by the community and how easily available they are and how accessible they are to everyone, I don't I don't think work Steam Workshop is actually something we need moving forward what we have now is already pretty good and if we do end up doing something with mods in the future I'm sure we could just keep going in a similar direction using what the community has done but- I don't I don't I'm not there are no plans on this right I'm not trying to say we're doing anything but yeah I don't know that's the one thing is I don't think we could I don't think we could just go straight to Steam Workshop, but we can come up with other other Solutions anyway it's okay, why does my steam version of satisfaction need to connect to epic game store firewall blocks, it needs to if you want to do any network related stuff it needs to go through epic game store because we use EOS epic online services which is what I was just talking about and when you do that because that allows us to have cross-platform play without it we wouldn't be able to have a crossbar platform play and so, your network traffic goes through Epic to to and then and then is handled that way, but you don't need to connect your your Steam and epic accounts if you want don't want to, you can keep them separate but the network traffic will still go through, EOS Services regardless, yeah I don't know if it like goes up through Steam and then across I'm not sure how it all connects but that's just kind of how it works
