> yeah it's good here right it's pretty good actually yeah actually yeah it's it's pretty good but- I don't really like the Swedish Pizza no see see this is why we hired you okay like this is we this is this is the one thing all of us Community manager here stand we we stand firmly on this rock okay Swedish Pizza is garbage and I'm like extra sensitive because, is it like Kebab Pizza is a thing and I'm Turkish so it's like extra extra bad for me oh really I mean is the Kebab meat like just it just ain't right here or it's like it doesn't feel like it's but it should be it's supposed to be that bad but it's right not the best you're used to like the authentic Kebab meat back home and, yeah is it dinner or is it some some other type of kebab y okay yeah see that's the Kebab I like too when I did he's used to eat meat but, you occasionally eat Kebab meet like once a year or something, or I do not do that anymore so so Danner was like the only thing that like there were like two there's two meat types that I and like actually liked eating one was Downer and the other one was like, what's a peace card like it's a beef the some part of of cow but the fancy one all right not sirloin but like the I mean it's sirloin I can't remember it's been a while but those were like the only types of meat that I actually enjoyed eating everything else was kind of like especially okay one also really weird this is also off topic but I always thought that chicken didn't taste like anything the chicken was like that's whatever it's not no big deal, so one time I actually got, when I ordered a fake chicken burger like I was supposed to get like a fake chicken burger but I actually got a real chicken and I bite a bit into it and I was like holy this is the most disgusting I've ever had in my entire life and I don't remember not liking chick disliking chicken that much and I thought chicken was like it's just Bland it doesn't taste like anything but holy like when you haven't had it for a long time and you have it again it's, it's wild but, kind of just like you were expecting something and I didn't meet it so it was like really jarring in your brain I don't know what it was because I thought for sure like if I bite into because the the reasoning I have is like sometimes when you order veggie food you're like kind of Uncertain like is this vegetarian I'm not sure right right and I think now thinking back like if no I'll know if it's me because like when I bit into that I was like I don't know if this is chicken or not but I'll try it and I tried it and I'm like this is definitely not this is definitely chicken this is disgusting but yeah I boiled chicken to my dog and I have that in my pocket so like I guess I'm consuming that just do it with his pocket chicken very good if I ever get stuck on an island with one person I'm gonna pick snook because he's got an infinite supply of a punk of chicken yeah man it's, it's disgusting because like I'll get chicken in my in my nails and I'm like dividing the pieces to my dog and I'm feeding the treats nice so like I'll have chicken so like and then I'll eat like something with my hands and it'll taste like chicken I'm like yeah and it's so hard to get out anyway what were we talking about I don't know Germany has the best donor it is pretty good there also I really like Australian kebabs we were talking we were talking about bad Swedish pizzas I'm so glad that we all agree on that yep well I guess it's stuck together I guess it sucks for you for you you too because you have to move somewhere where you actually had good pizza so we had better pizza and then we can yeah I'm so sorry this pocket jerky I guess it's pocket chicken exactly yeah all right well we'll proceed maybe to q a section, but Elena thank you very much for hanging out with us on the stream today did you have fun yeah it was super fun yes good to, meet the community I guess definitely that's one way to put it yeah, cool all right well thank you very much oh all right hang on wait wait before you go snoot do we have to go to be right back or is everything going to break no I can just kick I can just do this but bam oh it's just me and Jay's you know that she leaves it's gonna mess up the Discord layout, it is you know you just hang around on the call but you yourself that would be great dude give me more yeah okay all right hang out hang on for a second and then and I'll kick you out on the Discord call sounds good cool all right thanks a lot for hanging out with light and say bye to the light everybody bye finally she's gone wait I'm still here yeah oh it's all good it's so good sorry I'm getting a call from HR finger I could see oh it's just flipping us off I can't believe this, all right let me let me
