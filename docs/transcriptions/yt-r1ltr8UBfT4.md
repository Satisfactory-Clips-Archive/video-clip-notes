> damn right ramp railings, i i love this this teaser by the way so much fun making this, this game is playable now so we we we're honestly surprised of like the reception of this video, i'm glad that so many also got like the meme and the joke of this video, we were kind of like are people gonna get it but but it's it's but this is honestly ha this is something that's honestly happening like this isn't a joke in a sense like this isn't something that we're adding this is this is legit coming to the game all right, ramp railings one of one of the most highly requested features on the website on the keyword site actually believe it or not let's see if i can like on the on the website it's like what is it one two three four five six it's like the sixth most voted thing on the website, and as you may have noticed it's got this green like outline now isn't that fancy which means that it's been fixed internally which means that us confirming that you know we have a solution to this, so they are coming, so ramp rings are cool right but there are a few things that some people have pointed out that maybe not everybody has noticed so i'm just gonna quickly sort of like run through these things it's not a lot of things like this is a pretty short video and it's just like unveiling a small feature albeit a highly no sorry this is the main feature update five who am i kidding, so there are a few things here with the railings right that that some people have pointed out but i just want to clarify that they're correct so these railings right they work on both ramps and regular foundations they're also half railings which means that they don't span an entire foundation block so they're not eight meters i believe it's a foundation they're four meters so they're half that right which means that you can use those in in addition to the regular railings to like create you know if you ever have if you've ever in this if you've ever been in a situation which i find myself in a lot where i'm like building, with a walkways like a walkway up and then you connect it with like one of your, your regular foundations then you have like this gap on the side, which is annoying and and the way i've solved that and i think a lot of people have is like by placing when you reach like the top you use the the ramp railings to like sort of close that off that hole, which is which is a little bit annoying because you need to like anticipate that and then the last step before you reach the foundation is a ramp, it's a ram railing thing whatever it's called i can't remember right now, but no longer in update five you're gonna be able to just place the half foundation a half railing and that's gonna be it, so that's pretty dope, and yeah one thing that is sort of like sneakily added as well in the trailer is that not only can you place these on like the edges of the foundations you can also place them in the middle as in like in the middle as in like on the edge of the foundation but it's not placed in like the corner of the foundation it's placed in like the bottom sort of middle edge middle if that makes sense, it doesn't make sense but whatever if you check if you go frame by frame in the in the video and check the clip with the lizard doggo there's one shot where you can see one of these half railings so that's nice if you want to create like i don't know parking spots or close off like no entry sort of situations, i don't know the world is your oyster you do whatever you want with that okay, what else probably gonna be another teaser this week, tease more stuff and, that's just the way it is, i think i got everything going through my list here real quick

>, i'm a little bit sad that like almost nobody noticed it but i when i built the trailer or i made the trailer there's a shot where like you can see the, the train station where it's like the cameras like moving up towards with the ramps i built like, you know those like when you're going on roller coaster rides and like the line is too long it's a [ __ ] shot to showcase that, but i built that like set up because you can do that now since they're half foundations right so like they close off so maybe we'll do more with that in like later down because it's it's oh morgan notice it nice nice nice nice, originally when i made that shot it was not a ramp and then i realized when i captured footage that like but the video is about ramp railings so, redo so that's what's going on
