### Transcript

> Mark 6 conveyors and Mark 6 pipes when, sorry Mark three pipes Mark three pipes will not happen, I can tell you that much because there's issues with the, with the way pipes are calculated they're not precise enough to allow that fast speed even 600 is too fast and we kind of knew that when we pushed it live, so we're gonna need to rebalance that at some point mark 6 conveyor belts I don't know what the state of that is at the moment there's also a couple of issues with the conveyor belts that make them less precise, even for Mark 5 belts there's like a couple of issues, so we would need to resolve that if we were to even like think about the fact of adding like a faster belt
