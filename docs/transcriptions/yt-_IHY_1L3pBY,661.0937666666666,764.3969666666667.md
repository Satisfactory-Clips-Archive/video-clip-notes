> developers in the butt the next thing is do we know how to fix it so if we don't know how to actually solve a particular bug right away it might be hard for us to prioritize it when if we have no real direction or leads on how we want to solve it so one example can be a common issue that people have run into that's been in the game for many many years is a new character appearing when loading the save this is one that was posted a year ago but this issue has been there for three years almost since the the games Inception or from when the game was launched even and this is a tough thing because we don't really know how to solve it yet we know that that there are solutions for it this is not an impossible solve we think that there's a lot of features that need to be built around just to fix this one issue and so we've actually been sort of like postponing it a bit because we're not really exactly sure how we want to tackle it just yet but actually maybe this isn't the best idea of of like, of something that we know or don't know how to fix probably a better example would be the object limit in the game so right now there's only so many objects that can be placed in the game until the game like crashes and this is not something we know how to fix it's a it's a limitation of the engine we don't know what we can do about it at all and so we're not doing anything about it so this is just a bug that stays there and that's been there since day one and yeah however this object limit for the most part we do deem this as a not super severe issue I mean it is severe the game crashes but it isn't frequent and it affects very very very few people it's not cool that it's there and we do do things to alleviate it by minimizing the amount of objects that, are placed in the world because certain like if you build like one Constructor that's made up of multiple objects so we've optimized things so that when you build one Constructor it contains less objects that kind of thing so we can do things to alleviate it but we can't get rid of this we just don't know how but luckily those kind of bugs aren't super prominent sometimes I hate to say it but
