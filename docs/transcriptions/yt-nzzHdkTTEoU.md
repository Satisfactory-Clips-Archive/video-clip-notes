> i think that's, the things that i have on my list of things too what do you call it the, house cleaning housekeeping housekeeping that's the one oh yeah sorry i i was i was on a on a tangent there with dedicated servers so, update five is is is out we're still gonna keep working on like the dedicated servers and the functionality around dedicated servers for a while more so like dedicated servers are still kind of like extra in an experimental state they're not finished per se, there's still more things to do with them and we're going to keep doing that, for a bit more even though we feel we feel good about update five we still feel like there's a few more things to do with dedicated servers and one thing i guess i guess a lot of people probably figured this out already but since we launched, update 5 on ea that also means that we have to kind of mirror that on that dedicated servers because you need to play on the same version on on multiplayer because that's how it works so, up until up until the release of of update 5 we only had the experimental version so we put both like branches for dedicated servers to be experimental but now that there's an ea branch because it didn't exist when we launched it we flipped that to be the ea version right so now there's an ea version and there's an experimental version and if you want to opt in to the experimental version of data good service you have to use the like beta, boot up command or whatever there's this there's info about this on the wiki i'll probably poke poke a little, link here, for dedicated servers like all the information about dedicated servers for our game is really like best updated on the wiki you'll get like all the latest info there, so check that out if you're having issues or if you're getting version mishmash it's probably check the link cool
