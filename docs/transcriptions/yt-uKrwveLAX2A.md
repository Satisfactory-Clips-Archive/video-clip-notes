> would you consider working with alternative bricks, for example blue bricks instead of lego so like so some people have asked us this we've seen people comment this before and like the reality is guys like we're not working with anyone yeah we didn't do anything no we we didn't make the lego thing this is someone in the community did yeah yeah like we did nothing someone in community put this together and organized it and we just think it's cool that they did that so we're just supporting them and what they're doing where are you going to take all the credit like we don't even know like we've like we've thought about like well what if this thing gets actually made like how does this figure it out we don't think it's going to happen we're surprised it's gone as far as it has yeah and then we'll just figure it out later I mean honestly we haven't really put that much thought into it this is like nettle legoist is the person who put it together and it's this is kind of all their kind of creation honestly so yes
