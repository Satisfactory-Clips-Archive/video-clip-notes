> um will hypertube cannons be patched out eventually um officially support as a feature i don't know um i actually don't know i think i think like the reason why we haven't nerfed them at this point right is because we actually do kind of like not hate it i guess uh we would have if we wanted to nerf the hypertube cannons we would have done so um i mean there are also stuff that we wait to fix until later so that might be one of those things um but i don't know like maybe in the future we'll kind of like figure something out maybe you'll be able to like overclock the hypertube entrances or something to like increase their speed possibly i don't know this is just speculation on my part we haven't really decided anything yet but we also haven't nerfed them yet so we also don't hate that so i don't know we'll see
