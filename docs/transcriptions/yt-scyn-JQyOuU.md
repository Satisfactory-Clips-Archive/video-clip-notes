> in multiplayer will each have their own levels on the servers so right now there's no servers so you it's someone just hosts right so then basically um if you want to keep playing that save that person needs to host again and then you can join them um but we may be adding dedicated servers in the future in which case you can run your own or i assume rent one that might be a thing in the future but i wouldn't have support for that just yet yes
