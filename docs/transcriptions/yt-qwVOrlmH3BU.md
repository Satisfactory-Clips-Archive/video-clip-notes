> here's a clip for marv okay everyone we're going to be adding tower defense in update five we're gonna be adding, turrets we're gonna be creating like creature spawners with, mazes, and, we're gonna get rid of most of the factory, features so we're gonna we figure we're gonna pivot a little bit remove a lot of those things add some towers add some amazing functionality so that you can fight the oncoming hordes of creatures that are gonna be coming from the spawner, we're gonna change the name of the game too we're going to call it sanctum 2. and then we're going to release it, and then you can play like that right we're going to have a bunch of different turrets slow fields all these really cool stuff there's going to be story four player multiplayer, yeah happy to announce it all to you guys, coming coming very soon in fact I think we just finished it yeah we yeah we did it now it's out now you guys oh it's out right now sanctum factory confirmed the future is now things you just released today yeah you were you must have been like I had it on your wish list yeah we just released it nice oh it just popped up in my in my steam thing oh I'm buying it right now I don't even care that I work for these guys thank them too very good take my money again yo 14.99 what a steal this is just a big ad for sanctum too like the whole stream it's just a setup satisfactory in itself is just a setup for an ad for example if you want like tower defense and stuff like that and if you like that kind of idea seriously thank them too very good game all right I don't get paid to say it technically you do get paid to say it don't I don't think I get paid to say good things about sanctum I joined after sanctum yeah, but- I also joined because of sanctum so it's 1499 by zero that's how much I pay if you if you can divide by zero you get a bit of a discount but we won't add this to satisfactory until the amount of references that say that we're gonna do it overturns the amount of reference we have where we say we are not going to add it so exactly and that's a that's a steep hill to climb right now okay I'm just saying satisfaction is a dlc to sanctum
