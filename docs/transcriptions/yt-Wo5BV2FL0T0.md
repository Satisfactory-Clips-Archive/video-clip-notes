> do we uh are you devs and or some of your colleagues looking up to some other indie games uh that admire you if yes who are they are uh who are they i don't know if you mean like four satisfactory or like just like general inspiration because like one big inspiration for satisfactory has been factorio uh and and i guess subnautica in some sense as well those were like the main influences for satisfactory uh right now i don't know what the what the hell we're doing and what we're inspired by yeah i think i think right now i think right now our game is is is in a position where it's its own identity is so clear that it helps us inform whatever decisions that we need to make right so like we don't we don't have to look outside for ideas anymore the game kind of like looking at the game looking at the feedback we get from people looking at the state of it that helps us decide what is good and what is bad and so we don't you know initially when we had nothing we needed ideas and we took inspiration from other other things but right now the game is like its own thing
