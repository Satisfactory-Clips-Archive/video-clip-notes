### Transcript

> mug okay I can talk a little bit about mug we and this is going to be an echo if you if you were here last week and you heard me talk about this there's no new information but I'll echo it, there's no new news but we are working on the the mug it's going to be an enamel mug this is something that we've been going back and forth with a bunch of times, and let me actually give you the rundown of that as well, we've gone back and forth with like the material of the mug and we were, hoping to make an enamel mug but there were some issues with like the coloring or something with it that made it hard to like color the handle or something like that, so it didn't it wouldn't match the game perfectly, but we could make a ceramic mug that would totally have the colors valid and everything would be dandy but then we felt like but that's gonna be a ceramic mug that feels kind of lame, so we were going back and forth with this and it ended up the solution we ended up going with we changed the mug in-game I think we did I don't know if we've done it yet but we're gonna do it if we haven't already so we changed how the book looks and mug looks in the game, and then we're gonna make the the enamel mug, anyways so so that's what we're doing but we don't I don't know when this is going to happen I think there's still like covet has messed up a bunch with like the production lines and stuff like that so like a 9000 iq I know right, so so, like it's not a huge change chat it's a very tiny change- I pretty sure I don't remember if we already done it but if we did I'm pretty sure nobody noticed if we did I don't think no nobody will notice why we do it either, because it's a very tiny change that we need to do but, yeah that covert has been messing up a bunch, so it just made everything slower and I don't know exactly what the status of things are right now because I've I've sort of never been in that loop but we also shifted around so that now different people are like handling that at conference team and I haven't talked to them yet, that was more jace's day like I do a bunch of stuff that are called communicate community manager really and stuff and then jace does a bunch of stuff that's community manager related stuff, and we just don't talk me and jace we just ignore each other so I don't know what the state of that is right now, granted I didn't know about the people asked about it last week so I could have looked it up between them and now but who who got time with that I sure don't, so that's to say to that, the cup is still same well I just leaked update five maybe I don't know, that's that's a big change coming so, yeah that's the state of that and the designs for the the mug is going to be pretty much like exactly like the game a t that's a pun all right thanks everyone for coming to, our stream it's over we don't make puns here okay anyway, jason's work who would have thought not me
