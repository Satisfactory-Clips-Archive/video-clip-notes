> who came with the planet system name I think the system name is based on like the actual one that nasa nasa uses because it is a bit odd they have like a weird odd naming convention, I don't know I didn't come up with it yeah I don't know why it's called massage like two abb or whatever like that denotes that it's a bi what's the term is there there's two suns which there are and there's like two planet or something like that like if the name denotes or something like that binary yeah binary star system also fun fact a lot of people misconception okay a lot of people think that well the only one thing I know for sure that there's not a sun and a moon right it's two suns the moon the other sun is dimmer so that's the that's the sun you see during night and the other sun is the one the sun first sun is the one you see during day right so the moon isn't actually the planets you see those are planets there that are going around massage those aren't moons but that's the thing I'm not sure about I'm not sure if those are two moons or if that's like yeah that's no moon but the the key thing here is that people, think that the moon like the second sun is a isn't as a moon but it isn't it's a second sun and I guess like if if you want to get really technical too like if you were orbiting a binary star system you would see both suns at the same time which we don't really do in our game the main reason for that is because we wanted a day and night cycle so we just had to make that exception and make it a bit unrealistic but there's you know there's a couple of other things that aren't listed in our game by the fact that like for instance you can just construct buildings out of thin air that's that's that's one thing so you know being upset that the twin sun you know doesn't revolve correctly or whatever somebody did like, like, this is how somebody showed me like a diagram of like this is how the suns would would, rotate around massage to abb, but yeah game design game design is the most important thing realist realism is always second to games because that's that's why they call games yeah find this number well I don't know how fun it is that we have a day night cycle you know but it's it's an aspect of the game that we really wanted
