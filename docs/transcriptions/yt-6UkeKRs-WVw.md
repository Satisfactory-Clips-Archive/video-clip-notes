> one train update we don't know um something i feel like when i read on the steam forum sometimes about this uh there's a little bit of mis information maybe about about the trains in satisfactory um the trains are in early access sort of if that makes sense like when we released the train update we weren't happy with the trains fully and we even announced at that point that we were gonna like work more on trains at some point in the future this is also haven't had that pass yet yeah exactly uh this is also why this like a lot of the multiplayer bugs that you may have faced uh have been tied to trains and it's because like when we run into an issue sometimes it's worth doing like a sort of workaround solution and sometimes it's like ah it's better to save this when we actually rework the entire system and that's been the case for a lot of train issues where we know that we're gonna rework trains at some point we just don't know when so it's like not been totally worth it to like in invest a lot of time in fixing issues if we if we notice that like the issue we're trying to solve actually doesn't just like you know it's actually a lot of work to fix it um but we are going to improve trains at some point in the future that's that's we've we've decided that and what we really want to shoot for is like having some kind of signaling system or some kind of collisioning system or both uh i don't know exactly what's been decided yeah i think we've said in the past that we won both i'm pretty sure i'm also pretty sure that that's still the plan but yeah yeah so so trains are gonna get an update at some point in the future yeah um just so you guys know i've seen some people say that we're not going to do updates to the trains but we are going to do some changes to the trains and that also means that just a fyi for people that have built train tracks um when we do implement that uh similar to how we've done with other things we've changed in the game like if you set up certain train systems where adding a signaling system or a collision system on top of that wouldn't make sense then your break your your train lines are probably going to break so the recommendation i have currently without actually knowing what we're gonna do is to not have all your train lines on one single track and going back and forth i guess that's that's the only thing i think like following the the same path that like factorio does with like their multi where you kind of need like two directions with your train lines and tracks i think you're safe in those situations but i don't know that's just uh my gut feeling um
