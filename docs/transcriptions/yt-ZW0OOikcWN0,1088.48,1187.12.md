> just been playing it I just unlocked
> factory Organization and the reason I
> got this is because I could build
> foundations enough and the foundations
> are really useful when trying to
> organize your factory so this big open
> area here I might consider going to
> organization choosing Foundation and
> just building a lot of foundations
> foundations require cement so you need
> to make sure you mind a lot of those
> which I didn't do so I'm going to do
> that now
> all right so now that I have a lot of
> cement I can build a lot of foundations
> I think they kind of snap to each other
> if you're careful so that's nice alright
> so why would we do this well because
> factories get really out of hand after
> some time after you start researching
> more things and right now we're just
> dealing with iron but in the future we
> may want to we may want to automate
> production of steel things we may want
> to use oil or you know make computer
> chips or make motors and things like
> that and when that's the when that
> happens then your factory stuffs get
> really really really crazy and the
> Foundation's really help because they
> they organize things when you build
> things you can uh it sort of snaps so
> that everything is nice and neat
> you can light things up really easily
> and whatnot as opposed to just the
> ground where if I would have built here
> is it doesn't really snap in the same
> direction you can see it can be any
