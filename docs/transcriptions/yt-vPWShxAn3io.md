### Transcript

> here here as well and, boy oh boy do we have a big update on today, talking to the reporter on the scene, first of all I mean are you kidding or do you actually have an update well I mean I was going to talk about the story stuff but yeah go ahead okay well yeah yeah yeah so so there was, hannah who is not only our level slash world designer but, also our writer for the story and so today she did a big old, presentation yeah of the story to us to the rest of the studio and it was very interesting, we can't say what the story is guys of course but, yeah it was super cool and all I can say is like it feels like it's not basic which is nice you know I think it's pretty good like there are many there are many aspects to it yeah so that's pretty cool, it it won't be it won't be nothing it doesn't for you it doesn't force you to do the story to play the game or anything like that it's it's it's more supplementary because the game is about the factory but but if you want to chase the story you kind of can as well, but also did live live tweet yeah I did if you check out satisfac twitter.com satisfactoryaf, I think it's like the latest posts that you've done yeah- I yeah there's one tweet that I up to keep it in the in the thread but it's kind of funny that it's its own tweet so I just left it cool cool yeah but yeah you can check that out there's a thread about, that that's actually from hannah's presentation we just redacted a few things, yeah just a couple things but a few things that products yeah it's just a couple things it wasn't too bad though yeah where's the toilet dlc I'm pushing for it we're all waiting for that sweet flush bro it's getting stinking here, but yeah so hannah did a she's been working on like the whole story so we've always had like us since we released the game we've always been like we're gonna have a story in the game at some point and hannah is the lead writer on that and she's had like a you know the overarching like this is the start in the end kind of but now she's like fully sat down and like fleshed out like okay what does that mean, and you know all the everything that involves that story I feel like if I talk too much about it I'm probably gonna spoil so I'm gonna try and keep it as big as I can, but because the thing is as well like we're talking about the story right now and this is the first time that like the rest of the studio got to hear this story but like that's for 1.0 so that's still like way off in the future until you guys will actually get to experience that stuff, because we are we are intending to kind of like release the whole story as one big segment or like in one big patch or whatever so you don't get like the subnautica thing where you get like pieces of the story as we go in early access we kind of like want to release the whole story in one big chunk so that you don't get like the blocky like the the experience that like you'll get stopped at some point or some something like that yeah, or it's like or it's like you get past a certain point but your stuff gets added before that and it's like yeah but yeah so like as we've said many times a lot of the work in progress items are part of the story it's like mercy spheres and summer sloops

> it's funny because they've not drilled like anything today and like one minute before you glued up they just like started going at it they're watching the stream probably want to be on it literally one minute before didn't hear anything before that, yeah so so like the, samoan stuff as well so we we now know pretty much what they're going to be used for or their purpose essentially and basically we're just flexing right now and just being lost we know so much and you don't hell yeah yeah so we reflect but okay exactly so you make 28k the one thing we can reveal though that was a pretty big thing in the in the, in the presentation was that the story the primary thing about the story is that it's a cake that's the one thing that I got out of it like there's a cake and there's icing I wasn't fully listening so I only caught this part but I think this is a pretty big part of the the whole presentation so just just putting that out there very nice jay borden got there young dog shirt very nice young dog represent except not really I didn't go outside with this, my young dog was, in the is in the dryer right now but I am wearing the this the fix-it one so I'm trying to make up for it yeah so you got the you got the good one I didn't get one of those didn't you nope but you got the fix it, hoodie didn't you get another one as well wasn't there oh maybe that was yum dog gotta get yum dog yo yum dog is the best one it really isn't I mean it really is though I mean I all right well we've come to an impulse this is what happens when an immovable object meets an unstoppable force exactly, will the story be released as a book slash merch that could be interesting maybe it's like a or like a comic book spin-off like, portal did that would be really cool actually yeah yum dog millionaire was a good move I'm convinced buying another yum dog shirt don't do it don't do it hannah's writing a book with the game plot it's actually if you've seen the site the size of the, like the all the information about the story is like a book yeah like yeah because it was essentially a full one-hour presentation of yeah like both a brief presentation a brief yeah it's a brief presentation of like, of the the whole story essentially and also how the story is delivered which I probably don't think we'll talk about either but, so yeah but there's still a lot of work left there's there's, there's a whole whole time ahead of us to work on that and flesh that out so it's going to be dope I think I'm excited
