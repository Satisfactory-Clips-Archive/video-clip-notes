### Transcript

> gosh you have to ever answer everything like eight times well it's it's um that that's part of the job you know i actually don't mind it to be honest um because we have i i like our streams are fairly short like we only stream for like two hours uh but something that i've noticed looking at the stats for our streams is that there's a lot of people that like jump in and out of the streams uh and they just show up like answer questions and drop out again um and there's like a significant amount more people doing that than like watching the whole stream throughout so it makes sense that a lot of people like don't hear all the answers you know like or or the same questions stuff like that um so it'd be like you do and i don't mind uh answering the same question i'm also trying to like balance it out so that you know people that watch the whole thing don't you know have to listen to the same thing over and over again uh so yeah
