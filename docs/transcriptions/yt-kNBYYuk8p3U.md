> so when is dedicated service coming don't know don't know fam but there is a lot of progress being made on you know we get like almost daily updates on on what's happening with them yes like the functionality technically exists now i think the software technically exists now um and i believe that work from ui and stuff is also sort of happening but um so that's sort of where where it is so like there's real progress happening folks but as for when it's going to be ready we don't know because there's still so much uh sort of up in the air in terms of like say it could be ui etc and then also just does it actually even end up working uh what multiplayer bugs do we have to like start focusing on to fix to make sure that they're feasible we'll have to see but uh we're we're working pretty hard on them and uh we're gonna get it out to you guys as soon as we can like i don't think we're gonna necessarily wait like i think that the goal here is once we technically have them working even if they're buggy we'll put them out as like an alpha thing and then just have you guys just just just test them and see what we need to do and then we'll just work from from there so we're not going to hold off on them any longer than we have to yeah we're also not going to do any like exclusive deals with companies or anything like that we're going to pretty much just put them out there for everyone yeah yeah anyone who wants the dedicated server software can just grab it and just host their own or and i guess there will be companies that will rent out service too but i don't know if we're really going to be working with anyone
