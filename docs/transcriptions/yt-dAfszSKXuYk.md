### Transcript

> but yeah so i guess, the biggest news or like the biggest update on state of dev is that we finally have a release date for experimental, and i guess i should, maybe update the agenda so we reflect what we're talking about here but yeah so the biggest the biggest like thing that's going on right now is the fact that we have a release date we've had a release date for a long time sort of or like we've had an internal one and we've bumped that and that's this is the one so this is the one we're doing and, so if you do we tell them how the sausage was made about, you know no you'll just have to imagine the fire and, so if you don't know how this whole circus is gonna go down maybe this is your first time with us at an update or like maybe you haven't gotten the game yet or you're thinking about getting it for update five or something so the way this whole charade works okay is that on the 26th of october i should have had just like a screen just like just just show off the the the date but whatever, so on the 26th of october is when we are releasing update 5 to the experimental version of the game right and that's sort of the the early access out of the early access version if you will because the experimental version isn't like the quote-unquote stable version, off the of the game so but that's the earliest like possible way to get it is is that you you check out the experimental version on the 26th and make sure to back up your saves if you do and, yeah so so that version is probably going to be a little bit buggy and then we'll be working on like fixing stuff as people are reporting issues to us and, like a month or so ish it's been a month ish something like in the past then we'll sort of move over the, the update to the early access version because then we've had some time to like you know spend some time fixing up issues and making sure that everything runs fine and the people have reported all the weird crashes that that may or may not happen or multiplayer being broken or whatever and, then we'll move it over to early access and then everybody who don't want to be playing on a like the experimental version can check it out so that's that's the sitch on that
