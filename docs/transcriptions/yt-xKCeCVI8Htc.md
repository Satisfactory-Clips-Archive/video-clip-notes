### Transcript

> equipment workshop mk2 for only new equipment and new equipment tablet give a minimap what's your animals in fact that we've built i mean if you want like a mini map that shows animals and factories etc i don't think you necessarily need new equipment for that and you probably don't need an entire new building in order to create that equipment i think the you know if we decided that that's something that we wanted to add into the game we could probably you know we could probably add it right but i i don't think i think i just don't think we want to yet or at all i'm not sure i i guess it also depends on how a mini map would work with all your buildings it might get really cluttered but maybe the map already gets clouded i don't know but if we did add a mini map i don't i i assume we wouldn't hide it behind a an object you need to build
