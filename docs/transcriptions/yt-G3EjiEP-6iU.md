> can you add mark three pipes so no for two reasons next question yeah there's actually only one reason that's that's actually technical, mostly technical like technically we can release mark 3 pipes but we can't go above 600, cubic meters per minute or whatever the float rate is due to precision issues with the system the way that it calculates like the numbers they they the faster thing goes the less precision the the calculations can be up for the numbers that we're using the floating point numbers, and it's a problem that we have with conveyor belts as well and that's why you're not seeing like the mark 6 belt yet in the game we still haven't decided how we're going to solve that but there's also like much more to it with the pipes than just the belts there where the calculations also get a little bit skewed and stuff like that so it's I dylan explained it to me and I just like dozed off immediately but it's it's apparently a lot of dylan, he worked hard on that snook poor dylan no he did, too bad explaining it to me when I was five or something anyway, so so there's a technical reason why we can't just like add you know more, size of the pipes even 600 was like kind of pushing it apparently and, we're not sure if if we need to like nerf them or something but what we can do though is we can just like make pull everything down so like we balance the whole game essentially to be like yeah but now maybe mark one pipes are less than 300 maybe they're like 200 and then maybe the next one is like 400 and the last one is 600 or something like that because everything can be scaled down a little exactly and that wouldn't have been the effect is the same exactly, and that wouldn't necessarily mean that like oh does that mean that we have to rebuild our factories if you did that we would just rescale the whole game essentially but that's a lot of work and I don't know don't know if we're going to do that and it's most likely not going to happen
