> like how big is the update going to be we've been getting like like to up to update from what you've got before, looks like the download is gonna be six gig yeah so if you have experimental, installed right now the patch itself to like update your game will be around six gigs i think and i think the final like disc space will be around 10 gigs so if you're downloading for the first time you're gonna have to download like around 10 gigs give or take some compression that happens and one thing that we've recently kind of implemented in this patch is that we're no longer using like usually when we use the old engine version every time you did the patch you had to download the whole thing like the whole package and now we're using unreals like packaging system i believe, which is why the patch is a lot smaller than the actual game it's a pretty big bit yeah but there's a lot coming so yeah it's going to be pretty good
