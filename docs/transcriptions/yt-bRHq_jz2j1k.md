### Transcript

> what kind of youtube video are you setting up for some sort of trailer no no so, we're gonna do this thing called the hot potato save file where we take this save file and we play this for a few hours right we've made what we've made and then we pass it from one person to the next in the studio or of the people who want to take part and they each just spend a couple hours on it themselves and then pass it on to the next person but no one knows what anyone else is doing so each time another person gets, the save file, they they they're gonna inherit the world that everyone else, did you know had built before and then at the end and I will take the save file we're not gonna check it as as they go we're gonna take the save file and then, explore it and react to what they've done and see if that works out well that's the plan for the video who knows like there's a million things that could go wrong and nothing ends up working out but yeah yeah I made it up oh mummy thank you very much you were you were at the talk yesterday you're here to hang out with us very thank you thank you so much much appreciate it well it was a lot faster to go down oh  and I don't know maybe maybe on that video we could take bits from the stream as well who knows make sense to do that
