### Transcript

> I heard a bunch of vaccine opponents opened up in stockholm today is getting vaccinated well we're not in stockholm no, but I do know that stockholm compared to the region that we're in they're vaccinating people I think from 1986 or whatever and older I think it's whereas our region is 81. I think it's I think they're down to 18 now like 18. like our our, read like our municipalities the slowest oh yeah they're 1991 so yeah they they did just open that up that's correct, our municipality in sweden are apparently the slowest in sweden because we distribute them evenly to all the municipalities, and then it's up to them so like in certain areas where they live less people they get vaccinated faster, so it's a bit weird but we are we are getting there, we're going to be able to book I think believe tomorrow we're going to be able to book our first vaccination, wait at least really yeah for me at least I don't know how old you are chase but no I'm with the same age I think we're I'm older than you right I think you're like one or two years older than me so I think tomorrow is when they're gonna open up so we can book, for really because- I checked in today that said 1981 they're not gonna add like yeah yeah today but tomorrow tomorrow is a new day but that would be 1986. no the next step is everyone, oh really yeah yeah oh cool oh man okay thanks thanks for letting me know I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna camp the website tomorrow morning yeah yeah for sure yeah but sweden are doing very well when it comes to vaccination where apparently the fastest in europe or something I believe I read an article about that a while back but that might be dated information now but, vaccination wise we're pretty good
