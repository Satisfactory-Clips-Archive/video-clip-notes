### Transcript

> um so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to place one of the conveyor belts here and this is going to run like through all the the generators here i'm going to set up something that's called a manifold uh system or setup or whatever where things will trickle down so as i'm like placing as cold as like coming in it's gonna like um it's gonna fill up the closest one and then once that's full it's gonna fill up the next one and keep going until they're all full um i'm not personally a huge fan of this it's just like a easier way to build this just because you you get that uneven startup um yeah it is it can be a little frustrating because you have to wait for everything to fill down fill up before you can know for sure how your factory is behaving but uh it's it's easy to set up and it works yeah and we're kind of mitigating that a little bit before i do this actually all right let me come back to that so i'm kind of mitigating this by doing the four by four where they're standing next to each other so like it will split as evenly as it can as it progresses through the manifold uh but it'd be like it do uh next thing i'm gonna do is i'm gonna place the water extractors and one thing i forgot to mention is i need a little bit of space in between here actually maybe i'll do this
