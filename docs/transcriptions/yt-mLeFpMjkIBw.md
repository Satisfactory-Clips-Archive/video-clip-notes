> so I did treat my beard thanks for noticing I did trim it I've, I had, what's the term here I did a a, this is a swedish expression so I don't think this will translate but I did a hockey tournament beard which is like, a thing for for swedish, hockey players or something I don't know where this originated from I guess it's something related to hockey but during like the playoff you don't shave ever and then playoff beard so there so it is, it is, international I guess but yes I did a playoff beard for update 4 so I shaved, like before we started working on the trailer for update 4 which was like half a month to a month before experimental release and I didn't shave it, or maybe I shave it before I remember whatever this isn't interesting okay but long story short I shaved my beard a bit a bit I trimmed it down so now I look presentable again, and we're all here and enjoying it
