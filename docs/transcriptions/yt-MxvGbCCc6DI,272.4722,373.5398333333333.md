> So there's actually another area that's
getting a bit of a rework in Update 5 and that's actually gonna be the
Dune Desert, again the Dune Desert's got, you know, a few
changes over the years but it's gonna be a little bit more of a rework again in Update 5 now this wasn't featured in the teaser 
trailer at all so this is new stuff you guys The changes to the Dune Desert is kind 
of weird like they're more minor the Dune Desert looks and feels basically
the same as it did before however the changes that we did make are
landscape based so people who are you know kind of
concerned about their factories There's the potential that these landscape
changes may encroach on your factory So I'm going to show off some before and
afters of the Dune Desert changes just of a couple of the places so you can 
kind of see what we're talking about here so there's there's the big wall separating
the Dune Desert and the Spire Coast you can see that there used to be kind of
steps and now it looks a little bit more natural now you're probably not building factories 
there so it's probably not a huge issue but that's one thing that's being changed in the north eastern portion of the Dune Desert there's, , , there used to just be you know,
just dunes there and now there's gonna be this
massive crater there again this shouldn't be too much of an issue
for people with existing factories in that place as the
crater will be going into the ground so you might have a floating factory but
you know that's there now the eastern segment of the Dune Desert
is also getting a little bit of work done to it you probably don't have a
factory there so there's probably not too much to worry about
but there are some minor changes things have been moved around a little
bit there as well there's also this massive big rock
that's being introduced in the middle of the Dune Desert so if your factories in
the middle of the Dune Desert this rock may actually engulf
some buildings of yours that are there now the plus side is this rock isn't
super huge and you should be able to work around this rock when* it's introduced
but just a heads up that's coming as well but you can see
there's some some new looks there for some of the other changes that are
coming in Update 5 now with that the Northern Forest and
the Dune Desert are actually at a state
