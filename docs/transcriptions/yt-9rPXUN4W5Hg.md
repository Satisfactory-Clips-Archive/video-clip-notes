### Transcript

> us, will we use the blender for dilated fuel I've been thinking of that, that was actually a big reason why I wanted the blender because as I was doing things for update, free I was kind of I wanted to do certain things there that I couldn't do because I didn't have the option to to have two fluids mix in one building I had to kind of do this weird process to get that going of using like one refinery and then another refinery, so that's a thing that I want to add yeah but I won't be removing the the package diluted fuel that will stay as it is but we will probably see an other a new alternate recipe that also makes a little feel good in the in the blender all right interesting
