> um is there a fix coming for pipes losing fluids probably at some point that fix may either be a fix or it may be be a readjustment to uh fluids in general uh like from my understanding is that it may be an issue with how like the calculation with so so like the solution may be that we just rescale fluids down to a smaller number so it will all eventually effectively be the same functionally but the numbers will just be smaller and then so then we'll be able to calculate things more correctly if i don't really know exactly how it works but from my understanding that's kind of what needs to maybe be done unless we can find some other solution i also don't want to know how it works yeah i mean too much effort but it's something to do with the numbers and the scale yeah of uh fluids
