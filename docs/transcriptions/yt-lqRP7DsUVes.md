### Transcript

> yeah so, you have several job openings right now, this is true, what do we have we've got, like what don't we have right now programming something else, it's like sysadmin we're looking for assist admin who, specifically knows a lot of microsoft stuff, yeah what else is it there's like four or five different openings right now we're really hungry y'all and is it part of a general studio expansion or has sort of just happened, you know we have folks we have programmers as well we have, some folks leave, and in some cases, it's for expansion it's like a bit of both it's a bit of because like coffee stain has this thing where like we don't want to expand too fast right we don't want to hire like one billion people, at the same time because that won't work for us, and like with any company like people come and go and like things change and and you know so like as the game has been developed people have gone and come you know so like that's just the way it is, but right now we have a lot of openings we have openings for programmers we have openings for level designers or eleven artists and we have openings for game designers

> and part of that is because we need more people we don't have enough for various tasks and part of it is because people are coming out because like with game designer I think that's the same thing that's like what mark does right and there's one person it's mark yeah exactly like designing and balancing literally everything then the level designer there's just hannah she has gotten help from marie one of the 3d artists as well but, essentially it's just her so it's like we should maybe we could maybe spend those a little bit yes also like also to highlight those two specifically because in in the beginning or like during the whole production almost of satisfactory there's been like two level designers and two game, designers right and then for a long time now or like a few months or so it's just been hannah and it's just been marked like mark did all of their rebalancing for update 3 which I think was really impressive that I managed to like take over both that and then like completely revamp the whole game or like the whole balance of the game which is really impressive, and and now we're like maybe we should get more people on that boat you know, so so yeah that's what we're looking for right now yep
