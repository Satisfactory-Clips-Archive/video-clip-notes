> no we wouldn't do that have like safe containers for radioactivity because it's it's part of the game right that there's a trade-off of like rather there's if you want to go nuclear the trade of that is that you have to handle your nuclear waste right, that being said there are like it's not impossible that we add in the future something you can do with your nuclear waste, we probably won't like make it so that you can just like sink it or you know make something new out of it or something you know but we probably will make something, that you can make out of it or do something with the waste, we're making you recycle it in a like a different power situation or something I don't know there is some idea for doing something with the waste, but there there is a big trade-off with you know if you're, if you're making waste then you know that's the big trade-off of nuclear like yeah like nuclear waste is basically still usable fuel that's for generation four reactors of four exactly like we might make something like that or something you know
