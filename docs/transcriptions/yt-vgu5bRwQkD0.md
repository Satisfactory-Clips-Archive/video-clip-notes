> there's still like a bunch of stuff we're like sort of we're i guess this is kind of interesting to say maybe we're we're doing this week we're doing the the infamous content freeze for the game which means that like internally when we're working on update five and we're working like features for update five today has been like a deadline for for uh the studio to like be like okay from now on no more working on features we're not adding anything new to update five we're just gonna work on like fixing what's gonna be in update five and we're gonna start play testing more internally uh we also have a bunch of qa going on right now they're play tests in the game and uh like this is the like final stretch before the update actually reaches you guys when we just like focus on nailing down issues and and fixing things uh up until that point so today has been like i think the cutoff is like in in like a few hours even or maybe it was during lunch or something but the the cutoffs of today for the feature freeze code freeze confirmed yes yeah this is a pretty pretty stressful time for the team i think to to you know because this is kind of essentially their kind of like main deadline so people want to get their things in you know but you also don't want to break there's probably also like a bunch of stuff that people like been wanting to add but maybe they felt like oh i got to fix the like there's probably a bunch of like easter eggs maybe or like a few like extra features that people really wanted to do but like weren't scheduled for so they're like trying to get it in that's like most of our easter eggs in the game are actually like that where people like don't tell anyone they just like add a funny easter egg and then we find out during like the testing phase like oh wait this thing is here that's pretty funny um because there's a lot of people working on this game yeah i never a lot of easter eggs i find out from community honestly
