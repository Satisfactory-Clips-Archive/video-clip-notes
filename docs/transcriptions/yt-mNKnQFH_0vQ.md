### Transcript

> i've seen a couple of ques similar questions but essentially the question is like so though we've seen a lot of concept art for like buildings and equipment here but do you do any concept art for or any concepting for the world yeah the environment, most of the most of the environment, was kind of established when i started, early last year because most of the world was established in this getting polished and is getting a lot more love obviously along the way now but i do environmental asset concepts every once in a while, but it's not big picture stuff like for example what kind of biome do we want do we want like a dune desert biome and how should the landscape look like, i think, satisfactory is almost past that because we have so much established already so i was not really that much involved with that and also i'm not much of an environment artist i gotta say because environment art is a very very big thing in its own and it's not my strength so, i'm kind of happy that it's already so far in life advanced i gotta admit it so, but it's no it's it's really far advanced so okay
