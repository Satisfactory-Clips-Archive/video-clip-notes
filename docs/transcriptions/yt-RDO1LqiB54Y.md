> will the game continue to receive updates either minor or major after 1.0 that is the plan as it is right now you know we'll always we'll always see how it goes but like right now we sort of do assume that we would be doing more stuff after 1.0 like we it's something that we've had to sort of do right when we started defining what 1.0 is we need to figure out like okay so where can we actually cut it off because this is a game and and this is a problem with all games right you can work on your game forever basically um so at some point you need to be like okay this is actually kind of what we envisioned and so i do know that like what we plan for 1.0 is what we think is a complete version of satisfactory but that doesn't mean there can't be more things added it's just that we think that as a as it is in that state it is a complete experience that we're happy to put out um so uh that yeah like like it doesn't mean it it can't be expanded upon you know we i do know that we have plans that uh of features that we think would be really good and satisfactory but aren't necessary for 1.0 so then in those cases it makes sense that we would continue working on satisfactory afterwards but whether or not that actually happens i have no idea foreign
