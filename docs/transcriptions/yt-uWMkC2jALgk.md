> opinions on steam decks so, it's not really something that interests me and so i don't really have too much more opinions around that like i i don't really i don't really want to play pc games on a handheld thing i don't really want to play four hundred dollars for a handheld thing except maybe the switch but so maybe there's like maybe that doesn't make much sense maybe it makes more sense because i don't know i kind of just want to, in my experience with like valve products i i prefer to just like sit back and just let other people try it and then like see if people actually like it and if the implementation is actually good and then maybe i'll get it maybe not it's it's interesting i'm glad it's a thing i'm glad they made it you know it's not one of those things that i'm like oh this is so dumb why would they ever do it no i mean it's it's pretty cool hopefully it works out well people seem hyped for it that's great
