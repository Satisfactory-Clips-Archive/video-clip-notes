> what do you dislike most in satisfactory hmm that's a good question, just a side side note I remember that question is like a pretty common, question when you apply for a job at like certain companies and they want to like see like oh do you actually play our game so they asked that because if you don't if you haven't actually played like a game that's a hard question to answer not a super huge fan of that when companies do ask that question because like it shouldn't matter whether or not you play the game that they're developing like we don't give a if if people that apply for coffee like are fans of satisfaction like obviously it's great if they are but like the important thing is that they are good at what they do not necessarily like they're huge fans of the company and whatnot like or huge fans of the games I hadn't played a single coffee stain game before I was hired just putting that out there, so the thing that I don't what was the question again the thing I dislike most in satisfactory I think the thing I dislike the most is probably like the quirks with the build system that we still have in the game- I still don't think that building in our game is fluent enough, and I think that's that's like, exposed I think that's a kind of late tier thing more so because I've played the game a lot, and for me you know the the for me playing satisfactory doesn't exist like I don't play satisfactory for the fun of it, whenever I play satisfactory it's usually for making builds for our trailer stuff and when I do I want to do it fast I want to make buildings fast and there there are like tiny things here and there that kind of like block me from just like getting in flow, of the building so like tiny things tiny things like that for instance the indicators on like the split splitters and stuff like if you look at it from different angles they turn from green to red so that confuses me a lot the stuff like that there's also like the the guidelines sometimes they they do snap perfectly sometimes they don't so you don't know like when you can fully trust them, yeah like the snapping system snapping yourself some works in like 90 of the time but that like 10 percent makes it so you don't trust it so that makes it you don't want to use it sometimes for me, so I think that stuff like that mostly, that kind of irks me and I think these are these are things that we're gonna like you know look into more in the future so like- I don't really like doubt that we will resolve those kind of things

> but yeah I think I think because to me at least you know satisfactory is is a very different game for very different people like people play it very differently, some people are huge into the the like cosmetic building aspect of the game some are more into like the efficiency you know building setting up factory layouts and and that kind of stuff, and some people are more into like the believe it or not the exploration aspect of it and like the the multiplayer aspect of you playing together with friends and like going out and exploring and stuff like that, so people people play it very differently people have very different like opinions that's like what they like and dislike with the game some people are more about like the the ratios and like they don't like how how factory lines work I don't think I don't think I've ever a single like issue with how the game is balanced, albeit I haven't done too much of like the later like I haven't done I've only done like like, surface level plutonium stuff right for trailers I haven't really like played with that fully, but, but yeah people have very different opinions as like what they dislike and like with the game and and it's very tricky for us to like you know if it was just if they only listen to me then we would be focusing one thing right but we have to listen to our entire player base and it's really difficult to to strike a balance where everyone is pleased with what we do so you know we can never please everyone that's that's just an unfortunate thing with our game or with game development in general honestly, so, so yeah that's that's a huge tangent, we haven't talked about final fantasy today guys I feel like we've missed a huge aspect of the stream I just realized, let's see here yes we do we always work on optimization optimizing the game, it is a like you say it's a pretty taxing game but we're always working on optimizing it I also think the clipping is an issue if it's ever patched my world would be, clipping as like it shouldn't clip because that that's that's probably what we've accepted at this point it will always clip let's see yeah like that is that is a quality of life thing like that that's the other thing like I guess that's a good sign the fact that like the thing that irks me the most with the game is a quality of life thing like there's no there's nothing wrong with the game in the sense that like ah it's unplayable right like it's always like a quality of life thing for me at least which I think is a good sign you know even if we never fix those kind of things like it's still like pretty solid for most people because there's always going to be those people that have like thousands of hours and you know people that have thousands of hours in our game those are you guys are a really small, subgroup of our entire like player base and you know it's it's but you're also the guys that are like the most endearing, to us and like the the people that like really spend so much time with our game so you know these are the people that we we kind of do make exceptions for when it comes to like stuff like this, because if you really if you really think about it right the like the the top percent of people playing satisfactory that have like thousands of hours in the game they only make up like a small portion of our game right but they also have I think like one of the most valid like, arguments as to like what the game should like what change do we should make for the game, because they they're the people that have like the most knowledge about like what's like playing the game, but there's also an aspect of if if something isn't an issue for someone until they've reached like 800 hours or whatever the line is like 400 hours like and only one percent of their player base reaches that like mark in that issue, then it's hard for us to like really like distinguish like okay but is it worth fixing this for that subgroup or do we need to fix this for everyone, and the the honest answer is like we try to have both in mind really like when we do these kind of things when we make decisions we always try and think about everyone else about everyone but we do have those people that are like our die hard fans and they've played thousands of hours in the game and we don't want to brush them off just because that's a small portion of the player base, but you know that's always an aspect of it the fact that like the the really diehard people that have played for so long, you know maybe they are encountering things that 90 of the time other players don't so like you know is it worth spending, you know that many resources fixing something that only affects that small subgroup and sometimes it does, sometimes we we find that it do, but we also have to like really rationalize when we do pick these things right so so yes and and that's another point like a lot of I see a lot of people with high numbers you guys are also the people that hang out on stream with us, so you guys also tend to be vocal which is pretty nice too I guess in a sense, because we do want to listen to like the people that that are like vocal in our game and like our game because if we just listen on like what everyone else is saying maybe we'll just make decisions based on you know feedback that doesn't affect like the people that really care about the game I think it was, what's his name, sean murphy no wait no man's sky, what's his name sean murray close enough, murphy, I think he said during a gdc talk that like when they launched no man's sky you know they we all remember the backlash they got but the thing that they really like noticed was that, the people that did enjoy the game and the people that play the game like the people that own the game and play the game and like were part of like the actual core player group they actually gave them a lot of like good feedback on the game so when they when they took a step back and realized like okay but 90 of the bad feedback we're getting are coming from people that don't even play the game, we should rather focus on the people that are playing the game, because their feedback is probably more valuable and I think in the end that kind of paid off, so, and it doesn't really apply to what I just talked about I'm just like this is kind of like a parable to this but, yeah yeah I'm just giving myself an out to ignore your feedback exactly,

> so we're all in this together oh do we have command for the lego thing cool what are we sitting at 8700 for the lego thing, check the link you guys if you're curious about the lego constructor thing that's going on right now, yes this is why the pipe flow bug is never acknowledged right yeah we've never acknowledged that it's only an issue for the nerds I mean it it is an issue for the nerds, to a certain extent, I mean we have acknowledged the pipe bug and we want to fix it, but that kind of ties into what we're talking about here right because because we don't we don't see enough complaints about it because it only affects or only but it affect mostly affects the the die-hard people that are playing the game and really are going for that 100 efficiency right and the the the setups that they've made are kind of like above average so to speak, so I mean if you have run into that bug I guess like you can pat yourself in the back in a sense, so yeah there's very little tools to the bug yes it's also kind of true that it's kind of hard to debug the pipes overall I'd say like there's not they're not too I've talked about this on stream many times before too but the pipes also aren't like necessarily the most intuitive even when it does even when they're not bugging out right I think a lot of people are having struggle struggling like just learning how to use the pipes, and that's also something that we would love to look into so put that on the pile and and you know from our point of view too like if you take these two things into consideration right like out of those two things like the pipeline when you have like you don't get the full 100 efficiency and the pipes not being intuitive since the pipes not being intubated may affect more players and like they affect everyone almost then you know we kind of need to prioritize that because it affects everyone

> and sometimes we cannot see like okay but there are good tutorials and people kind of find the tutorials too and stuff like that but it's really difficult for us to to to make those decisions sometimes and it can be frustrating from the outside in looking in, because you guys might just see that like why don't you do fixing this specific thing, why don't you work on this this very specific thing that I'm running into, but there are a lot of a lot of people that have different issues, and want very different things out of the game as well, so it is very hard to like to to,

> plan for that essentially and decide like what we we do when we don't and that's kind of why we have these streams really because that's this is an option for us to explain why it is that way right, and hopefully we can resolve everything but I don't think we can resolve everything at one point I definitely feel like there are a couple of things that are more higher priority that I've seen from people in community that we should fix but we also don't want to work on satisfactory for the rest of our lives so it's it's a hard balance to make css confessional yes it's been a week since my last confessional so yes
