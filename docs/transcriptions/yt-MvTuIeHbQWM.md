### Transcript

> fixmas is my favorite time of the year there's been discussions about more events like this and so would be more likely post launch we have talked about other events, we said last year that we were going to look into more events look how well that went, we will always have fixmes at least I don't think like I think the problem mainly is that we we're quite ambitious, the people that work at coffee stain are really ambitious we always want to do a lot of things but it always ends up that I think a lot of that ambition goes into the major updates that we've made so far and I don't know like we've always wanted to do more events we have support for more events in the like the the seasonal system that we use to like trigger this kind of stuff that is support for many more events, stuff like that so there's always the possibility for more events and I think it's going to be like if we get around to doing something then we'll do it but right now there's no talk of anything else but I guess that's because we're so still kind of wrapping up fixmas because we haven't finished fixmas even so it's not impossible but you never know
