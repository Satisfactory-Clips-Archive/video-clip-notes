### Transcript

> and the last thing that i say a lot is is sinking fluids which you technically can you guys like i keep saying what the package them i always talk about yeah i always get this question like why you can't sink fluids uh i we talked a little about this before the stream today but one reason why i i thought of not being able to sink fluids was because byproducts become very like easy to to manage if you're able to sync fluids direct directly whereas if you if you want to be able to like just get rid of a byproduct then you at least have to add a packager to get rid of it um i don't know how you feel mark i think generally it's in a good state i kind of agree with the the sinking the byproduct issue although it's kind of on the same level as just underclocking a building instead of trying to go for 100 efficiency or or just feeding whatever into a building instead of trying to maximize efficiency you're still wasting resources so if that's how you want to play i don't think we should limit that too much and we should allow for it as well by allowing those kind of tools like a flute sync potentially although i think currently with the amount of byproducts that we do with fluids i think it's fine the way that we do it now where you just have to package it it's not that much effort it's definitely way less effort than actually having to manage the byproduct properly yeah so i feel it's in a decent state like i don't i don't see it as a major issue that we need to address cool but maybe in the future if we never have time so stop asking about it you guys no i'm just kidding is it such a common thing that it's no it's not there's always there's at least one every week but it's not like okay it's just the same person then yeah maybe it is actually i don't know i don't keep track
