> you had a question that I interrupted you maybe you don't have it anymore it's gone now that's gone, here's a question and someone said please pin the posts okay we'll do that here here's one will there be a major Improvement FPS wise to be expected, I don't know I don't know if it depends what you consider major and it also depends on so many factors like like what your setup is, and things like that and it also depends like how your factory is built because that can affect, performance in certain ways and then we may have certain optimizations that affect certain issues like certain bottlenecks but not others so it's it's really really hard to answer the question, yeah I don't know I don't know if there's going to be major FPS, things, I feel like between One update to another probably not from like from like multiple updates probably and I don't mean updates I mean like patches like probably you're probably going to see if for like you if you play the game the way it ran in like 2020 or whatever it ran so much better now at least on my machine but, it's it's like a constant we're making micro adjustments all the time, finding like all these, bottlenecks Etc takes a long time making we we are making like big fixes that have like incremental improvements, we're at that point really there's like no real low hanging fruit, but we are working on performance all the time so it's like it's never it's always on our plates to make things better and that there are things that, that we're working on that will hopefully you know fix or help maybe improve some people's things but like we won't really know until we test that with you guys and see how it goes yeah yeah but like it's it's hard to give a really clear answer to that question because it's like what what is Major yeah it also as we're improving performance you guys are also building more which also is more demanding so like it's a constant battle between those two things which makes it hard for like some people to actually ever notice performance Improvement yeah exactly because if you're if your game, becomes like under more load quicker than we can optimize yeah, it's not as if we're not optimizing it but also your performance will decrease yeah, good question
