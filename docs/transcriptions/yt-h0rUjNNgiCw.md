> thank you so much in terms of pure performance the fewer items being moved by a conveyor the better i mean i guess so yes or but there's but there's a lot of there's a lot of, optimizations that go around that kind of stuff that make it like so you shouldn't really have to think about that to make your game run better is that fair like is is there like it's probably not something that's more efficient to move your items, it's it's so hard to like give tips like that general tips because it's depends so much on how you built your base and how you're playing the game and like and the games probably won't matter that much yeah and if they if they do then it's like well then now we have a place to optimize and we should be looking at that one thing yeah exactly like should people really have to affect like theirs their play perform how they play the game based on like the game it should be other like we should optimize the game for how you play the game rather yeah
