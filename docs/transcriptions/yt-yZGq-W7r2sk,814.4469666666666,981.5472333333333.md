### Transcript

> this sort of fluid buffer situation here there's a few interesting things going on here first of all this this looks like frame foundation but it's actually not it's actually just wall frames built in a square kind of thing so that's a new piece that's coming but even if it's a wall or a foundation whatever you shouldn't be able to have these pipes intersecting the wall they're coming through the wall here so what's what's actually happening here so some of you might know of this thing called cheat crete it was especially it was a specific foundation piece that had like a bug with it that um basically allowed people to uh snap other foundations to it to clip foundations into other foundations so that they can come up with more interesting builds and so people sort of relied on that piece in order to you know sort of let their creativity flow and build what they wanted to build in update four we fixed that we fixed that piece we fixed that bug uh and people couldn't do that anymore and people didn't like that because we basically just stifled their their creativity essentially right um so we we reintroduced the bugs so that people can keep building the way that they used to build but we we don't really want to rely on a bug we would prefer to just have a system in place that allows people to build the way they want to build uh build the kind of things that they want to build rather uh and so that's what we've done we are now introducing this thing called soft clearance i think it's only manufacturing buildings we'll have hard clearance everything else will have soft clearance two things with hard clearance cannot overlap each other that's when you get the encroaching others clearance issue and you cannot build them on top of each other anything with soft clearance can be built overlapping uh anything else whether it's hard clearance or soft clearance so that's how this sort of works here these pipes these walls here have soft clearance i think the pipes have soft clearance as well and so they can be built through each other now and it's not just because there's a hole this could be a solid wall and you could still build the pipe through it um and that's up to you if you want to have things clipping or not right so uh let me just do a little demonstration okay so let's say for example if i put down this constructor i can put that down there but i cannot put another constructor down right because you know unless it's outside of the the clearance box right otherwise i get the encroaching others clearance error message so i can't build a constructor here right but if i take a uh conveyor pole for example or conveyor belts rather i can actually pass that through this building now and there's still an error message the the the clearance still lights up red and there's the error message saying overlapping soft clearance but you can now build there if you want okay because we don't we don't care anymore we'd prefer that you guys get to build things that look the way that you want them to look okay so we are now allowing this kind of clipping you can use it if you want if you don't like clipping you can just not do it if you don't want you get the error message as well if you want to play that way that's up to you you know walls as well are now soft clearance so you can build those into um you know overlapping if if you wish up to you um yeah so that's how that works i have another demonstration though let's let's take you to another
