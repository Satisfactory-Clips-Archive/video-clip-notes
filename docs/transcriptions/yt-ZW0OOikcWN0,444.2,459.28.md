> hi my name is Jace I'm a developer at coffee stain studios and I'm working on this game which is currently called satisfactory who knows if that'll change in the future many question marks around everything in life okay so first thing I want to do is introduce you to our game and I'm gonna show you how to play it and also just what it's about because maybe you've got a key and you can play with us or maybe you just want to see what's happening first things first the menu currently defaults to Swedish and maybe you're a sweet speaker if that's the case click on vowel game play and then change the language from English to native and then hit apply changes and now we're in English okay yes so this game is very much under development a lot of weird things sort of happened that makes no sense to you guys probably but we're sort of used to it because we're focused on more important things than little tiny things like default languages in the menu right now since we're not releasing any time soon okay but let's get into it hit play okay now welcome to our lovely little world here there are big weird plants okay so uh and there's that thing over there there's two of those things over there you guys okay so first things first just movement basic movement commands middle mouse click changes the camera from a third person to first person so middle mouse button clicking WASD to move just general if you've played any other videos before you'll know spaces to jump holding shift is sprints and you can see there's a stamina bar on the bottom right hand over the corner yeah so that's movement one other thing I just want to show you real quickly is because this is a multiplayer game where you can play online with your friends let's move away from the water cuz that's a little out you can also ping like these things right and to do that you hold alt and then you just left click where you want and it thinks this can be useful when playing online with your friends because if you want to draw their attention like hey check this thing out over here you can ping the thing and they can hear what's coming from and then also on the compass at the very top you can see that there are little diamonds that get drawn so you can sort of see where the pings were and your friends have different colors so you can see who pinged what and where so pinging is useful communication with your friends other communication dear friends is pressing enter and then typing down the bottom left you can see me right hello everyone and then enter and then it says it to everybody so we can also just do text chat as well if need be okay so the first thing you're gonna want to do for a factorize is we need raw materials so how do we find raw materials well if you hold down half this window pops up and you can see what you're looking for like maybe iron could be useful so if I let go of F now a ping will go out and we can see if it finds any iron or wait okay we get some sounds over here on the top of the screen you can see on the compass at the very top it says iron and as it rotates I guess it's in this direction so if we run in that direction we'll find some iron you can always see if there's anything else nearby like is there any copper nearby oh okay let's go upper right there nice what about this time it's done there live it there and in this direction apparently ok so there's some copper here there's some stone there and what was the iron ok this iron here this sounds like a really good place we've got a lot of resources here and a big flood area this isn't an accident this was by design this is basically the base where you should be starting your game in the future I assume there's not always gonna be the exact same base that you start in but for now this is what we have but it's pretty and it has a big stone bridge and now that you found or what can you do with it well you can you can extract some more you can pick it up on the screen there you can see it says press you pick up iron ore so you press a little minigame pops up and to pick it up you need to press this pick need to click on the pick button when the line is in the blue section so ma'am I'm doing it and it gets quicker and the window closes a little bit and if you turn right you can pick up more and more okay so that's pretty slow and tedious but it's all we've got right now but we can check to see let's see how much or we got I press I to open the inventory and there's my or and I can drag various items around the inventory if I right-click on the or it splits that stack up into a half of what it was so I can do it again and again like that then I can follow each other again so that's how the adventure works so I have iron ore but like what do I want to do with it well first thing I would say you do is you could build a trading post now you do not need iron order build a training base this is free you can just build this with no resources at all so the way I did that was I pressed B to open the build menu I'll click the Trading Post tab click on Trading Post there's a hologram and if I can't build somewhere goes red if I can't build some ways it's blue and then I just left click again to build it now I right-click and right-click again to just get back those menus and I have a trading post so let's see what can we do here well we can research schematics so here we can choose what would I like to research what looks useful in a factory well I think conveyor belts would be useful for hover ever automated construction and click it you can see here that it's you know if I if I research this schematic I'll have access to constructors conveyor belts and conveyor poles it costs 25 plates and what this means is if I click back on the inventory so this is now active if I click on the inventory there's a ship section here and there's a time here so in 9 minutes and 18 seconds this ship here is gonna ship off and pay for a schematic and so the schematic cost is 25 iron plates so if I send 25 iron plates on the ship I'll get the schematics required for constructors conveyor belts and convey pulls back so I can improve my factory so how do I get iron plates what did I need I need a 25 iron plates yeah right here okay well there's a workbench here attached to the Trading Post so here there are M plates here that's what we need and to do that I need to iron ingots for 1 iron plate and ok so let's click on iron ingots and I need iron ore for that so I can click that it's selected with a little blue thing there and then I just spam quick produce and you can see I'm making iron ingots now I have 10 now I can make iron plate some of those ok so that was only 5 I need 5 20 more yeah ok so then I'll just rinse and repeat the process until I have the plates required to ship one other thing I'd like to say real quickly is we can make another one actual workbench so if you're playing online only one person can use one workbench at a time but if you you can create extra work benches so you and a friends can work at the same time ok so after running back and forth to the iron or picking up iron ore coming back making ingots making place I now have 20 five iron plates so what I could do is I can go back to the Trading Post here and grab these put them in the ship and in seven minutes our ship will ship off and deliver the plates and we'll get the schematics back okay so what we do now for for seven minutes well we can pick up more iron ore I guess or we could it would be better if we could automate that because it's really tedious right it's it's slow and it's annoying to play that minigame all the time so if we hit beter from the build mint build menu again and go to production we have the schematics for a miner already now what I can do is I can shift left click on miner and what that has done is that has added a list on the top left so I can see what I need to build one and if I shift left right click on it it goes away so if I do that now I see what I need to make a miner I can spend my time doing that for now so I can play some minor on this iron ore here and maybe another miner here then I'll be getting a lot more I know that I can do by myself all right so I've made all the iron rods and iron plates that I need as we can see up here in the top left corner but I still need wire so zero to 12 wire what do we need for wire so we there's wire here in the work bench that requires copper ingots copper ingots require copper ore and if we remember copper ore was over here so this is this is reasonably tedious right now which is why we want to build this Factory things will become automated and very very efficient later okay so pick up some copper ore all right let's do this okay so picked up a bunch of copper ore and I ran back and I turned it into wire okay great we can see that we now have all the requirements all the resources we need in order to build a miner so I'll Cove it through the iron ore deposit here I'll press B make form in the production menu click on miner as you can see miners no longer red or anything and when I sort of mouse over that it goes goes blue obviously I can't build a miner here it's red yeah and then if I use the mouse wheel I can rotate the miner so that it faces the direction that I like and I like this direction so click and now we have a miner yay okay now that we've made it what I might now that we've made it what I might do is I might consider getting rid of this short the the text on the top left salt shift right click on a miner and the text up here goes away okay so now we should have all the ore we ever need right there's nothing here it's open this I just press to eat but it says it needs power okay sir now we need power how do we get power well if we press the build menu there's a palette that conveniently enough and there's a biomass burner here but that requires 59 place 15 iron rods and 20 wires so I'm gonna shift left click that again so I see what I need and before we can automate things I'm gonna go and pick all this stuff up manually all over again see in a second okay I have everything I need okay so let's build a biomass burner so I'll just build it I guess I'll just build it here that sounds good again I can press e on it to configure it and what I can see is as a fuel section here and there's nothing there and basically nothing's happening we need some by a mess this looks like by a mess press e to pick up by a mess all right so I'm gonna run out pick up a lot of plants come to me plants all right that's semi plants let's go put the plants in the machine alright so I'll take a stack of 100 and I'll drop it into the fuel a listen to that sound a biomass is it's doing its thing okay but uh it's not actually powering that though so what we can do is we can uh we need cables alright I'm gonna go dig up some more copper make some wires make some cables alright I have a bunch of cables oh I can get rid of the biomass burner text on the top left now by shift right-clicking and I can do a power line from the biomass burner to the miner and now you can see the the light of the top here went green we can hear it starting out oh yeah that's doing this thing now cool press e on it still nothing it doesn't say needs power though oh here we go hey look at that and we can just grab that manually if we want to just take it you know just leave it alone let's do it let it do its thing yeah okay well since iron ore can only become iron ingots in it's not really useful for anything else would be really nice if we can automate that stuff as well so let's see what we have available to us in the production tab we have a basic smelter what does that do well smelts or into ingots and goods can be further persistent to do things that sounds really good so let's build a basic smelter so shift left-click we have the little choked up for it now on top left we want one of those eight iron plates paint iron rods and four cements alright well this guy's taking a lot oh we can see that this is full now it can't actually mind any more so let's take that out so we can keep mining what a beta construction has been in luck that means our ship has been sent so we can go back to our trading post now let's pick a new thing let's uh let's research can very splitters mergers and containers that sounds really good okay so that requires 25 iron rods 225 iron plates I'll take care of that in a bit let's let's carry on with the smelter alrighty we have the iron plates and rods that we need but we need cement what does cement require it requires stone okay I know that there's stone right there so I'm gonna go dig some of that up make some cement as well okay now that we have the cements I'm going to build a smelter in front of a miner and you can see on the hologram that there's like an input and output the green box on the left with an arrow pointing in is input orange with the arrow pointing out is output I'm gonna face the input towards the miner like so right click to get out of the menu and then I'm going to build a conveyor belt which we just researched but they require our in plate so I'm gonna make some iron plates first so we have iron plates now so I'm going to build a conveyor belt I'm gonna you can see it snaps to the output of the miner so click on that and we can build it wherever we want but let's build it directly to the input here maybe yeah Hey look we got iron ore it's doing it go go go go go it goes up or does it what's going on all right we need power of course so let's uh let's let's let's create another power line I guess right well I I can't I can't seem to do that it's red okay well why oh I wonder why it's because this actually has one power output the biomass burner so it can't go from biomass boner to that and to the smelter so that means we have to make another biomass burner or we can use power poles power poles as you can see here they can handle up to four connections so let's use a power pole instead what I'm gonna do is I'm going to destroy this power line to do that I open the build menu and then go to this little thing up here and click on that and then if I look at it you can see this is red outline and then I left click gets destroyed and I get my cable back okay so let's make a power pole all right so pal pole is gonna go I'll just put it here for now if I guess there that's good and then I'll take power lines now build a power line from the biomass burner to the power pole power pole to the minor and then power pole to the smelter perfect and now that that has three cables going in there's only one more outlet so what I might do just just to be safe as I might build another pal fall here hook that power pole up to that power pole and now we still have three more outputs here just an efficiency thing that I've picked up along the way anyway okay we can see that the iron ore is going in let's check the configuration of the smelter to see what's going on we can see iron ore coming in we've got iron ingots coming out I can take these ingots even and put them in my menu in my inventory rather cool there's also recipes tab here so we can make iron ingots or we can make copper ingots so it's important that if you're going to make a smelter over by the copper deposit to automate copper production you can put a miner on the copper as well of course and the stone if you put a minor on the copper and then connect that to a smelter you want to configure the smelter to receive copper or to create copper ingots otherwise it won't make it yeah cool so now we have the smelter and now we've learned power so let's talk about conveyor belts just for a moment conveyor belts is super cool you can put them pretty much anywhere you don't even have to connect them to anything you can just put convey about from here to here if you wish but you know you can put them make them get really far if you want and on the top left end you can see the cost that you need for the length so it says 48 iron plates right there so it's just like the one here and then you can see that's these ingots are coming out now never fear they weren't fall off the end you don't need to worry about that yeah so then you can connect another convertible from here and build it in whatever direction you want and then from there to wherever you want you can sort of do whatever you want with it they're really cool you can also ride them conveyor poles can be useful too again you can rotate with the mouse wheel just like you could with a minor and you could build it and then choose how high you want it and then from there you can snap conveyer belts to convey pose they make a rollercoaster okay so I've just been playing it I just unlocked factory Organization and the reason I got this is because I could build foundations enough and the foundations are really useful when trying to organize your factory so this big open area here I might consider going to organization choosing Foundation and just building a lot of foundations foundations require cement so you need to make sure you mind a lot of those which I didn't do so I'm going to do that now all right so now that I have a lot of cement I can build a lot of foundations I think they kind of snap to each other if you're careful so that's nice alright so why would we do this well because factories get really out of hand after some time after you start researching more things and right now we're just dealing with iron but in the future we may want to we may want to automate production of steel things we may want to use oil or you know make computer chips or make motors and things like that and when that's the when that happens then your factory stuffs get really really really crazy and the Foundation's really help because they they organize things when you build things you can uh it sort of snaps so that everything is nice and neat you can light things up really easily and whatnot as opposed to just the ground where if I would have built here is it doesn't really snap in the same direction you can see it can be any direction okay so just wanted to show you guys what a big factory could look like there's some like copper things being produced over there it's like a multi-story factory going on here there's more here I have no idea what's happening here pretty sure I helped build it though and this is the starting area where I showed you guys before yeah so it's quite quite big and you can see that the the world is also quite big okay so one other aspect of the game is exploration this is a big beautiful world why not see it why would you want to see it well let's find out first things first if I press I to open up my invent treaty let's check out some useful supplies and nail gun that's always good we'll put that in our hands and a gas mask well if we see any gas and we can put the mask on okay and a useful thing for exploring our vehicles so here's a tractor there are different kinds of vehicles in the game but we'll give a tractor but one thing is at the back here this thingy here is the workbench and in the workbench there's storage for the tractors so you can have the tractor to hold things there's also fuel so you can't drive it without fuel so I'm gonna use some biomass I just put it in there and then I'm gonna get in the tractor okay so on the right hand side of the screen you can see our fuel for the tracker - the biomass that we put in we're in the tractor let's go on an adventure okay so we gonna go drive it's a big world who knows what's out there could be dangerous though that's why the guns useful the nail gun okay so take a left here see what's around Hey look there's some feet little hook thingies let's get out and pet them hey little hug Oh God oh boy okay all right they're not friendly okay nothing's friendly he oh dear okay so I'm just gonna get back in the car this is way too dangerous go away stay away get out of the way they're attacking McKee run run okay okay we made it I think we're safe now oh dear oblate seen us okay shooting fire it should be fine okay Oh hugs behind me - this is the worst day of my life okay so exploring oh okay I didn't know it could do that but that's helpful thank you very much friend let's fight it leave me alone shoot reload shoot reload Oh God please stop attacking me I mean their home I mean their home oh okay well that was exciting you can see my health at the bottom right is not looking too great but uh yes so adventuring is all about the journey and scary moments like that but also look at what we found here what's this it's coal so adventuring also leads to finding different resources uh here's some coal we could use coal to power our plant instead of biomass which would probably be more effective okay so uh I think I'll wrap it up here I've covered pretty much all areas of the game if you're playing the game hopefully this is enough to get you started and I really hope you enjoy it and if you're not playing the game you're just checking it out maybe a friend or family just wants to show you what they're doing this is what they're doing it's a really cool game and you should be super stoked for them yeah well thank you very much for watching I hope this was fun and entertaining and also educational and if I ever see you again that'd be great if I don't see you again have a great life alright bye everybody let's jump right there it is broken
