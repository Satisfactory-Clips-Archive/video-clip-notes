### Transcript

> if there's anything else- I know that I posted it on the youtube video but if there's anything else that you guys want to see in update 5 specifically don't forget that we have a qa site okay, I'm going to drop it in chat actually I'm going to drop it in both chats because I know that I forgot to do that last week when we streamed on steam, that's not the right address what the hell one second there we go all right so I'm gonna drop it in the in steam as well so we have a qa site this is the best place to report issues but also report feedback to us about, things that you would like to see in the game and things you don't want to see in the game maybe but you know improvements that you think we could do with the game, and if there are things on the qa side already that you think that's a good idea make sure to upload that and make sure to share your your tickets so that people can upload them and find them, if you're making a ticket on the q kiwi side make sure to search for before to make sure that it takes one but regardless whatever you do we see everything that's posted there we are not able to like respond to everything I know that this can be really frustrating for people running into issues with the game, if if you don't get a response for us but believe us we see everything on the gateway side and, I guess- I have a little bit of talk about that as well about the the whole thing about early access as well but let me just finish my turnabout here first, so yeah searching what's that so that's that's the thing where you use the search bar the search bar isn't amazing so sometimes even if you search for something it doesn't show up I'm not quite sure if we're gonna put more work into that but regardless if you if you see anything on the qa site or maybe you just browse like the top most voted ones and see what you believe in and make sure to upload the things that you think are important to after the game and, yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna repeat that during the duration of the stream because the qi site is such a good tool for us it is it's so amazing for us to like, look but fall back on not only for like looking it up issues like I said but also for feedback I know that like when mark looks into game balancing and changes to like anything in the game he first does like a round of searching around on the kiwi side to see what people have been writing about certain topics, there's even been a case okay you guys where I've seen you guys request something in chat and then I tell mark and he's like this could be a good thing to do and he's like all right I'll take a look at that and then he searches the qa side and there's not a single post about it that tells us that like maybe this isn't something that people actually care about so if you do care about in the game you have to go to the qa site and make sure that your voices are heard, because I can only like you know go to mark and be like this might be this is what I see in the community but then mark can get a completely different picture of like yeah but I'm not seeing any interest in that so make sure to go to the qra site that's what I'm trying to say
