### Transcript

> I was gonna say yeah so so the idea was originally was just like we showcased a lot of stuff from in the building that was going on because our office is currently being renovated, turned out that like we didn't really have that much to show yet because it was just bland and boring to show like there's nothing like our office is huge we were only on like two floors in that entire like out of five or whatever yeah yeah like it was like basement the lobby and then that top floor that was like literally all we were in yeah the office is massive yeah and the top floor wasn't even the top floor
>
> [Laughter]
>
> actually it was the the top of the stairs where we climbed up that was the top yeah that's true that's the secret door is actually in the lobby you could probably see it in the drone shot maybe yeah you can you can also see the television that's not placed in front of the couch
>
> [Laughter]
>
> that's also funny because that television is from from the top floor that we brought down to shoot with and then we forgot to bring it back up so when I watched the drone footage which was shot like a week later I was like oh there's the tv we forgot about that
