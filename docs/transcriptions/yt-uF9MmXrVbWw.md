### Transcript

> also Implement more realistic physics so foundations require supports this is something that we played with many years ago and we had a working prototype of that and then we were like no no how about no yeah so, yeah I don't think that's gonna happen actually I don't that's that's a pretty hard no I think we really didn't like it yeah no yeah also if if you thought your computers were running hot while playing the game just wait until we had more physics oh yeah exactly
