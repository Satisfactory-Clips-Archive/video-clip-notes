> all right anyway let's actually talk about this stuff yeah so we're supposed to so welcome to, yet another week of like kind of not having any real news here, we're, if you weren't here last week or if you weren't here the week before that we'll just like kind of rehash the same information again but essentially what's going on is and it was what has been going on for like the last couple of months actually is that we're trying to figure out what we're gonna do next essentially not like necessarily like well that too actually what we're gonna like be updating the game with next but also like what what are we gonna do like with with how we update the game as well, yeah we've been sort of and we can yes yeah yeah so so so we we've kind of been we are kind of landing on an approach that is different to what we were doing before I think last time we may have also said we might be doing a different approach and then we ended up doing update five kind of the same way we did update three and four, but this one, like we are getting to a point now where the kind of things that we work on result in kinds of updates like as we get closer to 1.0 the kinds of things that we work on yeah will result in sorts of updates that aren't the same as what they used to be and so we should it would be silly to apply the same strategy and yeah the more we we think that and you know the more we talk about that we're more the more we're kind of landing on a different approach to how we, package the update how we communicate it to you guys how we yeah and how we tell you you know what's going on so, yeah so it's it's looking like the next few months you know leading into whatever update we have coming is going to be a little different, but you know we're just going to be doing what we need to do for the game and, that will you know get it in the best place possible as quickly as possible even if things are a little different because I think, we've always said this last couple of updates too that you know like we anticipate or like we intend to release the game at some point we're not going to be stuck in a in early access for forever and just like keep hashing out updates over and over again, even though that's very exciting for you guys and I mean it is exciting for us too but I think, you know we we can't do it forever I think we're gonna get really drained working on the game if we keep doing it that way, so so we've always had like 1.0 at the horizon and I think one thing we've also kind of like realized is whenever we've been pushing the last couple of updates where we always said like oh yeah we'll push this update and then this the next thing we're going to work on this and then we'll get to 1.0 but we keep like kind of moving the goal post a little bit when we make the updates because they become more grand and like when we even when we delay updates we realize like oh we can fit in more stuff now in the update because we delayed it and then that in turn also leads to us pushing the goal post more, so you know at some point we just have to sort of figure out like or that's what we're trying to figure out now is can we keep doing it the same way but still retain 1.0 or do we need to change it up, so we actually get to 1.0 at some point and I think that's the sort of thing that we've been like going back and forth a lot about, and, still haven't really landed on anything yeah but we seem pretty confident in our approach now which means hopefully in the next few weeks or so we can actually give you guys like much more concrete information on what we plan on doing, interesting comment by rusty here so more effort going into refactoring for long-term success rather than content in your term, in the near term I assume so it's actually somewhat correct, it's a mix there's still we still have a lot of new things that we need to do but there is actually a lot of effort going into things that will like ultimately not change the game but like need to be done for for future content or for further stability or you know like there's a lot of things that we can say oh the game's early access and we'll fix this later well we have to fix that later right like that has to happen at some point and so it's a lot of and some of that work is being done too and you know that's not necessarily stuff that you can package and market that well in particular particularly, even though of course all the people who are already playing the game will appreciate those changes, because they will impact you guys as well, but yeah it's just like that's why like these updates are yeah they're just feeling a little different now they're gonna be changing and so we just have to have a different approach so yes we, yeah like I said before we don't have any news today to share with you guys on like what actually is going to be the future for the game, because we need to sort of settle ourselves first we're just like trying things out in our mind right now and in the planning and like what makes sense and and what not, it feels like the dust is settling a little bit now yeah we have been saying that for for weeks now and we have been working it out for weeks like you know it sucks that we can't really come to you guys and give you anything concrete but like it's just it's just how it is yeah there's there's a whole lot of puzzling going on at the back end as like like if we either whatever approach we take like okay but what fits in whatever approach we take and what makes sense for us what makes sense for you guys what makes for an exciting you know release or whatever, I'm trying to balance it all trying to balance it all and it is, it's it's quite difficult it's, that's why sort of it's been like you know the intention for us was to sort of figure this out in january and we're in the middle of at the end of march now so, yeah that's this way we just put another thing here that's right do you want to wrap that up no yeah I was about to wrap it up you can go with this okay comment though, so billy the door says are smaller updates easier to manage releasing a bunch of stuff that one seems like, tough to troubleshoot yeah it is tough to troubleshoot when you do big, major updates but obviously there's one the marketing value of having a big update you can make a big bang but the thing is like smaller updates is something that we've like we've talked about as well like maybe we should just do smaller updates for this that makes a lot of sense for us to wrap the game up instead of like packaging things but the problem is whenever we make changes those changes affect other parts of the game and sometimes adding a small feature or even a small fix requires many many other parts of the game to be either touched or updated as well for it to a work at all or be justified so, so then so it's like sometimes it's just literally not possible to do a smaller update because if we make one change to how things work in the world we have to update the entire world with that change for any effect of that to be, seen, so yeah it's like we can't really like we can't really even do tiny updates, that doesn't actually even make sense logistically, even though it would be it would be kind of nice to do that but yeah yeah it is a pretty huge, process just to like push a patch by itself, there's there's a lot of moving parts even though our game is like tiny compared to you know like the bigger aaa like whatever cyberpunk you know ssd whatever like our game is tiny compared in comparison to that but it's still a huge undertaking just to like get anything out and and make it functional and stuff like that, so yeah like I said we don't really have any new news we just want to kind of like keep you guys informed as to what like what's going on sort of even though we don't have anything to share we just still want to like vent a little bit I guess and say that like keep keep you guys up to speed with yeah with most of what we know at least yeah, and, when we know more we will, hit the old drum bang on the drum bang bang bang but, someone else asked are we still gonna be releasing videos yes we still have videos in the pipeline, so like we had the wiki video that came out last week which we'll talk about in just a second, but then we've also got I think we have two more kind of big videos, coming out as well, and yeah I'm really curious to see what you guys sort of think about those videos, and- I think they're gonna be kind of like, there's gonna be like a two week gap so we put a video out last week there probably won't be a video this week, and then maybe we'll have the other another video out next week and then yeah we'll see how it goes yes
