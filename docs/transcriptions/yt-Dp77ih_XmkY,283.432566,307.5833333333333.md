### Transcript

> Right, Snutt?
> No
> Oh...
> Just kidding
> We've actually changed it so that power generators
> are no longer self-regulating
> Previously generators would only produce as much
> power as the factory was consuming
> But generators now always produce the
> full amount of power
> With the exception of Biomass Burners
> And this will mean you will likely produce excess power
> Which can be saved up in Power Storages
