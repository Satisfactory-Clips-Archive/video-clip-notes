> need hardcore mode you die save gets deleted I like the idea of a hardcore mode you know we've got even like a lot we can do with like the like recipes and stuff as well if we wanted a hardcore mode but also like hardcore in that like you know dying and stuff so like when we have game modes in the future I think hardcore is a great idea but obviously people want passive as well people want creative mode as well so like those things too but I think a hardcore mode makes perfect sense
