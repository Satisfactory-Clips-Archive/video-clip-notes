> just how badly will update five mess up my spyrokos factory, probably not really that much at all, we sort of anticipate update five not really messing up factories at all not not really that much, but you're saying spyro coast you're probably talking about the major changes that are coming to spyro coast those changes are not coming in update five so if you have stuff inspirocus you're still going to be fine when update 5 rolls around but we do recommend that you, maybe build really high up if you really need stuff via the spire coast or move your stuff out of the spire coast, keep in mind that the nodes all resource nodes will should remain in the same locations we don't plan on moving them, yeah and, if you want to know more about this stuff I'm gonna post a video here that jace made, a while about about changes to the world and like the world updates that are coming up day five but also goals for like 1.0, so there's a lot of in-depth information at that video
