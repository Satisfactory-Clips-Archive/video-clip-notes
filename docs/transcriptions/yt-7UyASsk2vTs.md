### Transcript

> um the only bit of i guess news that we have today really is that uh fixmas ends today the uh fixmas event that we've had in the game um either has already ended today or it ends today including today i don't remember if the the timer or whatever includes january 18th but uh i think um am i too late to say muted that's true we missed that segment um we replaced it but um yeah it's uh it's ending today and um in case you didn't know um everything you've built in fixmas will still uh stick around your factories won't produce anything well technically they can if you still have presents lingering around but like giving i think they call fixmas gift trees uh they won't produce presents anymore which means that you you know the first start of that cycle won't be possible but the machines will still be there if you still have presence left they can still be producing i think you can't place any new production buildings to use those recipes because those recipes are like hidden um so i think that's the state of fixmas right now so yes hope you stacked up on the balls the snowballs any balls really hope you stacked up on that just collect your balls yeah i hope they lasted all year round
