> have you ever considered, this is more of a general question but if we've ever considered in, contributing this instant spline mesh back to unreal engine oh that was funny we were talking about that in upgrade because yeah every time it's such a pain, did you guys already know because I know that if you do contribute to unreal engine you have to support it, most of the time I don't think we want to do that there is a yeah, for one it's so closely tied to the the rendering pipeline that any changes they make which we want to be privy to yeah would be problematic and then we'd be beholden to fix and update a little bit, and we also just that we do some things where we're like for example you can see it here it's just commented out like vertex fetch instant transform buffer and lightnet buffer we're just like we don't use these we don't want them because it's extra data so we're optimizing them away but if it was a just for the engine version they would definitely not be cool with that so in our specific instance we can optimize away the unused stuff that we know will never use because we only use for example dynamic lights lighting so I'm getting good messages let's see- I've got a message from our, technical artist technical artist ben he's awesome, he's like but I but I want them so we'll we'll discuss that later well we'll have a little chitchat so that's funny though
