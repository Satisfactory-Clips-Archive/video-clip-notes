> you guys ever thought about updating the values and machines when overclocking without needing both the items and power i need to wait i need to look at that that would that that would be nice because like that's sort of been annoying for me sometimes like when i yeah when that when it's not being updated because like it doesn't have power or something like that you can change the slider but all the other numbers don't change i believe that's what they're talking about and then you have to you have to wait for it to like either finish processing the previous item which maybe makes sense but oh you mean i'm pretty sure oh yeah yeah i understand exactly what you mean now it's like the the input and output doesn't update until the machine starts running yeah yeah yeah dude yeah that would be awesome i thought about that when we were doing the epic stream like man it would be nice if it's it's so clear if when you drag the slider to see like what the input and output becomes because you can you need to sort of calculate that right now, qa side hell yeah let's let's drop that in there upload that stuff on the qa side because that's definitely something that, i think would benefit the game i mean what i know i'm just a stupid community stupid community stupid community manager
