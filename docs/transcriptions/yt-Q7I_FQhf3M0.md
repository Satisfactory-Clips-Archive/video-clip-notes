> sorry are we going to see any dual screen enhancements independent of a large content release that's not what ds means it's dark souls enhancements what what what is ds in this console I can't figure it out we'll get back to that nintendo ds release yeah right, I'm trying to chase the hell, dedicated server oh my god of course the hell boy do I feel stupid all right let me go back and see what that question was about, if I can find it  oh are we going to see a dedication of enhancements independent of large contour release yes that has that has been the plan since the get-go, the the the main crux we've been faced with is that, the people that are working on dedicated server stuff they tend to like jump around a bit so, we've we've had a we've not been able to work on dedicate like the specific specific dedicated server things, for a bit but we're jumping back on that boat and hopefully we'll get a couple of updates, for dedicated service out soon-ish same goes with the docker image that's something that we were wanting to do since we launched dedicated servers that's something that we've, sort of resumed working on a little bit but we keep getting it you know when we're not a lot of people working on on satisfactory so we we it's hard to like dedicate one person to solely do one thing a coffee stain because we do so many things at the same time, so sometimes we need to jump around a little bit and that's sort of the that's been the case here we've always had docker images
