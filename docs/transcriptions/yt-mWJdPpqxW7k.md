> uh ue dev said that it would be easy to upgrade yeah that that doesn't that that would be the case since that's right customer engine yeah even if the engine wasn't customized i don't think it would like i don't i don't believe that for a second personally i i don't like i there's there's too many ifs or buts or exceptions or uh weird things that that can happen when you update the engine i mean we updated from four like four point something i remember what it was and then skipped like three versions into still into unreal engine 4 right we didn't even change the engine uh and that was a lot of work and takes it takes a lot of justification for for us to be like yeah this is definitely worth the effort and it was in in that case but it was a lot of work
