### Transcript

> cohesive look to them So a lot of people also asked
&quot;Why was there no 'before' shot of that cave?&quot; it is a cave that
already exists that cave has changed too much for there
to have been a before and after shot i'll do a before and after
kind of fly through right now for you so you can see what's happened So the the insides of that cave has
changed a little bit and actually its location
within the world has moved a little bit the entrance to that cave-
the entrance has stayed the same but the inner workings
of that cave has moved around quite a bit so i couldn't actually get a camera to
do a before and after and i guess- i guess if there's anyone out there who
builds factories in that cave get your factory out of that cave because if you're going to be in trouble
in Update 5 don't- why are you building factory
in a cave anyway? that's- that's fine play the game
how you want to play all right but maybe take your factory
out of that cave yeah okay so that's a bunch of like
world changes that are coming
