> like to see a soundtrack that i can buy from steam because i often turn down the sounds that have game music for the most parts okay um as for the soundtrack i think the plan right now is to release one eventually but we kind of want it to be done first so like there might be more sounds i think there are some other things that we have to work out as well but but i it is like i think everyone is interested in that i don't think you could find anyone at coffee's then that's like that's a bad idea
