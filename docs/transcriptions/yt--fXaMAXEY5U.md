> is there going to be more equipment coming like rifle mark ii uh i don't know i think there's gonna be more equipment i don't know if rifle mark ii will come because that was a kind of weird i don't know why that made it into the game it yeah that was so funny you want to give the lore about that yeah sure so it was that was our initial release or was that after our initial release i think it was update one it might have been an alpha honestly it was yeah update one i think it was update one i can't remember but it was one update where we released like the next coming tiers and in one of those tiers we unlocked like the rifle which is unlocked in here six or seven or something like that and uh we had prototyped like i don't even know if we prototyped that that was just something we added internally it was never supposed to make it to the build so there was a rifle of mark ii in the game that was worse than rifle mark one i think i think the reasoning might or i think the the the how this transpired was that we we had mark one and mark two and then mark one was worse than than it was now like it was worse than mark one white rifle and the mark ii rifle was set to that and then we prototyped it a bunch and like i don't like it i don't like the fact that you have two rifles and i don't like how weak like the rifles are so we bumped up the rifle mark one to become better like what we attended for mark two and then we we intended to remove mark ii rifle because we felt like we just need one rifle but then we accidentally included it in the build um so that's the story of how that
