### Transcript

> jordan's gonna show how much throughput they have can you please make it that trains and cars have that too, I don't know how possible that is because I mean maybe questions about satisfactorygame.com I don't really know how possible that is if, since there might be more variables when it comes to like cars and stuff in terms of like terrain it might be harder to calculate whereas like drones for example you know the draw the drawing will for the most part be unobstructed unobstructed and flying to its location so we can calculate its distance using a steady speed much easier but the other is not so much but feel free to make that suggestion it's still kind of cool that's kind of how I think it would work anyway I'm not sure if I'm right
