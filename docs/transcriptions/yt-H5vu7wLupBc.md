### Transcript

> do either you do programming outside of coffee stain I haven't really done any for a long time I kind of wanted to stay away from it for a while but I'm getting the urge to not necessarily do programming but like make games again, like like small games on my own like whatever I want to do, which would involve doing some programming, I hadn't done programming since I became full-time cm and until yesterday when I decided to do it on stream were you super rusty or oh yeah yeah oh yeah yeah better come back real quick though I was also using a programming language I haven't used in even longer because we do we do most of our programming c plus and I programmed in c sharp yesterday c sharp is kind of similar to c nice, it's really it's really easy to use but there's a lot of like I was like the first thing that happened was- I was I want to call it a super function I was like wait what is that called c sharp, super parent, someone in chat was like bass bass bass, as a bass okay yeah yeah there was a there's a lot of moments like that where I was like I don't remember I had to do this too eating troubles but I guess that's good to do on on stream then because like people who know can just give you like the answer right away yeah actually- I didn't mind like the backseat programming that sort of happens naturally when you do programming stream it was kind of fine and in that instance because I didn't remember most of the things so yeah yeah that was actually really good
