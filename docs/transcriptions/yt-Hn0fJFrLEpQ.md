### Transcript

> highlights like we mentioned before me and jace are super swamped i guess one nice i guess one like uh thing that might be fun to reveal is that we've uh we've shot the patch notes video i've seen some people ask if we're gonna do like another passionate video same like type that we did with update four and we are we're gonna make one of those and we have shot it uh we have filmed most of it there's like one or two shots left or something or maybe a couple more depending on how how much creative freedom i i get with it we are going to do one of those patches videos again and it is almost wrapped all right yeah like the yo you're pretty much you've only got the hard stuff the or the time-consuming stuff which is like the b-roll right getting all the shots in game but uh all the live-action stuff or pretty much all the live-action stuff is filmed uh we need to do some voice-over stuff but that's like pretty quick yeah voice-over stuff uh and then comes the hard part of editing it yeah which is like 90 of the the process god i wish the other i wish it was the other round because it's kind of fun to film it's like it'd be nice if like when you're when you're after like a full day of filming and you're like super [ __ ] tired you're like all right we got the hard part out of the way but that's like that's not true at all i guess so yeah

> now we're just wait and see these it's the hard part for me but you know like there are some shoots that we do that are you know they're kind of fun and then there are some shoots that are just restful as all hell like update four shoot was uh it was pretty fun i think that was pretty fun it was a long day but it was it was pretty fun update three yeah was hell update five was somewhere in between those two i agree like once we got out of the like stressful part of the filming then it was like nice because then we could focus more on like getting really good shots and stuff
