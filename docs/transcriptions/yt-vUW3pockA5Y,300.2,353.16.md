> ..so I lurk for some shit and I find out what people say. Feedback, ideas, like the trello board was amazing. Not everything works in the game as it is now, some other things are good and especially when we see things, people are saying: &quot;you should do this&quot; I'm like: &quot;we got that planned&quot;, it feels good. It's sort of a sign that we are on the right track. It is exciting that people have been this responsive. I truly didn't expect this much hype, I mean I thought the game was good, I was hoping that other people would do as well, but I think the response has been massive, I didn't expect that and obviously thats really fun. It gives us a lot of energy, cause now we know that people love it, and its more people than we thought. You know, we gotta make the best game
