> what people say feedback ideas like the Trello board I thought was amazing not everything works and the game as it is now some of the things are good and especially when we see things people are are others saying oh you should you should do this like we got that blend it feels good it's sort of a sign that were on the right track it's it is exciting but people have been this responsive I didn't really expect this much hype I mean I-I thought the game is good I was hoping that other people would do as well but I think the response has been just massive and- I didn't expect that that's and obviously that's really fun it gives us a lot of energy because now we know that people love it and it's more people than really thought you know we've got to make the best game Thanks
