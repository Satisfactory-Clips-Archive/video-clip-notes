> whatever, that reminds me by the way, last friday dylan did a dev stream, our one of our programmers, where he worked on some of the engine up upgrade stuff, so if you're into that [ __ ] you can check out the vaude it's still up, maybe i should make it available actually i tried to do that but it kept freezing actually no remember, and we're gonna hope and see if we can get those rolling a bit more often actually because a lot of people really like them or i really like that stream yeah i'm trying to i'm trying to organize constant like stuff with content with the the devs so we did a video with anna like two weeks ago or something like that and then we did the stream with dylan last week, i'm gonna be filming another video with ben our technical artist talking about optimization and basically also just like what is it, so some people can also get an idea of some of the optimization things we're doing and maybe you will also learn more about like what optimization is and how that actually works within how how you do it within games in general so he just wants to talk about it, because i think there's like a lot of misconceptions on how like how do you optimize in a game you know yeah just making people more course yeah a lot of people just be like just go and optimize it now like it's not really how it works so like hopefully that will clear some of that up as well i think it'll be interesting but that video won't be out for quite some time because we are busy so i will probably release it after the update so not for a few weeks but it'll make for a good video for sure live rigging please, is there anything i guess maybe when bring your bring your hard alcohol it is actually [ __ ], doing rigging it's horrendous it's i don't think it's as bad as doing uv mapping though to be honest like i prefer rigging over uv mapping, rigging is just horrible because it like the more you do the more you do it the worse it looks like you have like ikey bones and [ __ ] all over the place and it just looks like a mess but it's not a super frustrating process i think but uv mapping is frustrating as [ __ ] all right glad i got that out of my way you feel better i i had like a i was doing a lot of blender stuff this weekend and i just lost my [ __ ] how much i hate blender which is the software we use here at coffee stain for our 3d stuff anyway, i don't know which idiot who made that decision, anyway as long as they they're happy i'm happy, that sounds like i hate it but i'll take it that's the most passive swedish thing as long as they're happy i mean what could i say like what the
