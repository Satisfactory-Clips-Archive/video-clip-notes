> news, was that talking about yeah so we talked about the engine upgrade for a long time so the engine upgrade for those who don't know is a an update that's it's like our next coming patch where, the game has been running on oil engine version 422 for a very long time and we've been upgrading the engine behind the scenes and it's it's been a pretty big process both because it's a lot of engine versions like it's for we have to do from 23 to 25. it's just a big leap and to add insult to injury unreal engine has are on like 426 now so we're already behind even though we haven't even pushed this update, but, what was the point of this, yeah so the engine update is essentially when we are upgrading the engine we get like a bunch of tools that we can use when we're working on the game, some things have improved that epic has been working on so like when they're doing, stuff for fortnight they find like oh this this feature is nice for networking let's add that to the engine, so we get like some imp performance improvements we get some some bug fixes, there are some bug fixes that existed in the engine version before we before 425 that we had to fix and then now epic has fixed that in the engine so now we have to you know add the actual bug fix so it's it's it's a messy process okay there's a lot of work doing the upgrades and doing the upgrade we also run into like a bunch of issues so but anyway so we're doing an upgrade patch, and that's coming out fingers crossed today hopefully, if everything goes right, there's been one bug today or one crash rather that we discovered that we wanted to fix before we push this patch it's very likely it's going to come out today but you never know and it will probably be kind of late it seems because this was discovered like today or yesterday or something like that and it was brought up to attention today so the the way we do patches and the way that we like rolling out a patch for our game is there's a lot of work involved there's a big process involved with it, and that's not including like you know smoke testing and like making sure that it works just getting the patch built and getting it out on steam and epic it's it's a lot of work okay the build pipeline is not easy, so hopefully today it will come out to experimental, first and foremost and i wanna really really say disclaimer here this is a very experimental patch because we haven't been able to test everything with that upgrade because we're working on like so many different versions on the game, so the engine upgrade has been like been its own little thing for a long time and then we've been working on that and then i was switched over so most people are using it and now we like caught up and fought fought physically fought all the bugs that we run into, and, really today guys there's a cm joke again pretty sure it's gonna be today it's not we had we don't have the build ready yet which is why i'm saying maybe not, but we are working on it and, as soon as, the patch goes live we're gonna tweet about it and you'll probably notice, and, yeah so so but yeah so the update is gonna come out on experimental first because this is gonna actually be a very experimental build, and, i i really really recommend if you if you check the twitter before the stream you you probably saw that i really recommend that you back up your saves for this one okay because, don't trust cloudsync i've gotten a lot of messages from people where sync, either didn't work, or it's it's a very easy like user error to like just click the wrong button and then it overwrites your save files, and this happens on both steam and epic so like it happens regardless of platform so just back up your saves if you if you really care i hate like if i feel super sad whenever i talk to people that reach out to us i'm like hey is there any way to get back my save my safe file got overridden by cloud save or like something happened in the game that broke my save file and and i got super sad because there really isn't we can do about that, if the safe hall gets corrupt or, if if epic or steam overwrites your safe files so re really asking you guys to to back up your saves if you if you really don't want to lose like if you have a lot of work like i know people that have like thousands of hours on their safe office hurts my heart to, to hear people having running into like that, is there a command for backing up saves no so what you'll you're gonna have to do is you're gonna have to go to the folder where you have your save files which is in your local app data, factory game saved save games, this is where you find your save files i can actually copy paste maybe the the command or not the command but like the the that was called, the directory, unless someone's already done it while i was doing this, usually when i have jace on he can like distract you guys while i look this up or other way around here we go, copy

> paste five people already did it all right fantastic now i did it as well so now you know i'm i'm working okay, so yeah you can find your save files in that directory just copy it somewhere on your on your folder, on your desk, back up your system32, game save manager to run periodic backups that sounds like a good idea i also heard people that do like git, like version controlling on their save files which is pretty cool that i do that sometimes as well you can't trust epic and steam honestly on the cloud side stuff like or even if they put everything right you just muck it up yourself with the the cloud sync thing thinking thingamajig, so yeah, so that's hopefully coming today i don't know for sure i've been told that they will let me know during the stream when when status progresses or if patch notes are available for me to at least read out because there's going to be a few, fixes with this patch that are not new features but like some some new stuff, that will hopefully improve things so yeah
