### Transcript

> I saw a question about, are trains hard or soft claims I actually don't know that I think they're harming their parents and actually yeah I and I don't know if signals are hard or soft clearance because someone is asking a question about like they've got like a double track and they might want to have signals on both sides of each track for example therefore their signals are going to collide I think that's so- I don't know I actually don't know what will happen yeah I'm trying to think because I think yeah I think I think that's fine because I don't think the signals will, I think the signals are hard clearance but I don't think they work the same way as some of the other hard cleaners because there are like exceptions to some of the hard clear stuff that we've done and that's been the case in the past as well like when you're clipping, when you're snapping to certain things and the signals are snapping to the edge of rails so I think that will work but I'm not 100 sure
