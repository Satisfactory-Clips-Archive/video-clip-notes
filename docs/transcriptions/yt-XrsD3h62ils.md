> it was a question controller support we always had control support in mind and I mean there is control support but but we every time we update the game and balance the game and add more features the controller support and changes the ui the control sport just goes out the window so I think we kind of just like keep it on the back burner and then we'll look at it again and fix it and then it'll probably break or something but I think it's pretty decent you can you can remap to control those right or or not yet do you guys, what what's the question you know if you can because like if you remap your buttons your keys yeah you can remember controller I'm not sure because we've we've been focusing so much on like getting ui working and like implementing new features so we've kind of like not tested with gamepad because it just it's an extra, like an extra thing to care about cater to when we make new so we've just focused on keyboard but there should be like a ton of control support yeah I'm pretty sure we're gonna get it like we just need to do some other stuff first
