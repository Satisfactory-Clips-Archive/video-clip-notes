> mark two pipes are fixed not yet um the fix for pipes is probably gonna happen with along with update five maybe uh or maybe sooner but i don't think so uh just because those issues has been in the game for since pipes were introduced in the game um and maybe some of those issues get like worse because of other reasons um but there are a few bugs with pipes that's been in the game since launch and this these are things that we're aware of same thing with ghosts like how pipes are kind of unintuitive in certain cases and that's also something that i think we're going to like we'd rather do like a step back and look at pipes overall and see like what are the main issues with pipes what do we need to fix those and that's probably what we'll do that overhaul and that's probably one we'll probably remove them yes exactly so update five we're gonna remove the pipes simple easy fix what's wrong with the pipes there's some they could be improved yeah there's some bugs there's there's some bugs or like some ux uh yeah issues with them uh there are certain cases where like so there's a few bugs where like when you boot up the game and uh the pipes aren't like full or like they don't have the proper flow or something when they start up so sometimes you can run into issues where generators won't boot on startup for instance you need to like roll the switch once or flip the switch once when you start um and yeah that's that's an issue we've known apparently since we launched them we there's no easy fix for that apparently so that's why we haven't fixed it up until this point um and there's like yeah various like precision issues uh with how the flow works in the pipes but also it's the same issue on the conveyor belts actually uh where if you don't have like a good frame rate in certain cases you might run into precision precision issues especially on like when you're maxing out the pipe flow and like have 600 cubic meters of water in them uh and you use them for generators and stuff like that uh you might run into some issues but yeah sure might there's a few things with pipes yeah but we are into it but but i have a feeling we're going to have like an overhaul of pipes at some point and you know actually not just like fix the the bugs but actually like look at like okay is this how pipes should function in the game and like yeah before 1.0 so to speak
