> General plans for Post-Launch? So people have asked questions about like DLCs, Loot Boxes, Micro Transactions .... post launch updates and how long are we going to support the game for? Multiple maps for example. We will most likely support the game after launch. I think we kind of had planned that If you look at our past games we have supported those after launch like Goat Simulator go to a lot of DLCs, even a free DLC. Sanctum, Sanctum 2 even has been out forever and we have been supporting that. There's been like updates for that game over the past couple of years So it is really likely that we're gonna support Satisfactory post launch. As for DLCs that is something we've like heavily considered but whether or not we'll have it. I can't confirm or deny Micro Transactions will not be in the game, nor will loot boxes. As for multiple Maps I mean right now we need to focus on the map we have now.  Again, it's a handcrafted map So we don't really know right now.
