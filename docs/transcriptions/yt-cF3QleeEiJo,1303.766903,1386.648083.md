> people have been wondering if i play it on experimental and i have a save there will i still be loaded if i switch back to early access and yes you will you will the saves will will generally the saves will always load if you're playing on a newer or the same version of the game and you can see that if you check in like the left corner in the game there's like a version number there or a change list number rather cl if you will
