### Transcript

> can you ask the dev team release some info about the new recipes yeah yeah like we will talk about that stuff, hopefully before hopefully before beforehand I know that, that's that's one of the things that we we think it's really important to get that info out you know the same thing with the spire coast like everything that affects your current build, we want to get that info out as soon as possible the reason why we haven't divulged you guys with this info yet is because, we haven't finished all the recipes yet so we don't know exactly which recipes will be affected in what way I mean obviously all the beacon recipes you can already kind of like imagine will be affected but we don't know if the if the if those recipes are just gonna be like no more beacons and that's it and just to keep the same recipe or maybe we need to have another part, you know there's so many like even if you just add one part one recipe you can affect a lot of chains so we really want to spend the time to like look into the recipes and make sure that, they make sense so but once we have that information we will share it with you guys, hopefully sooner rather than later
