> and people are saying f in the chat yeah because power just went down oh no oh that's a bummer it's almost as if we kind of plan for that you know it's weird anyway so we need to break the fourth wall what just happened was the power went out i kind of wanted to like maybe explain a little bit about what we're gonna do today so we're gonna automate, modular frames which is a part, in the game looks like this and it requires these parts to be able to like craft it so i can manually craft some of these items so if you want to like manually craft a modular frame it requires reinforced iron plates and it requires rods but manually crafting this in this game is boring because you just sit and watch a screen like this and i guess you could play the entire game like this no because you can play the game that way if you want to everyone has you know if that's your jam handcraft percent speed run yeah but we kind of want to automate this stuff, and currently it's a bit of a bummer because we don't have any power and we kind of need power for the factory to run, and one thing that's also a bummer is that currently in the current phase that we're in the only power generator that we have available are these biomass generators which essentially you drown out in the world and you collect biomass which is like leaves and leaves and bark wood and stuff like that and, you still have to like manually feed this into the machine i've also set up a little bit of chain where you can actually automate some pieces of it where like if you put in wood it will make biomass and stuff like that but it's it's very tedious to keep like running back and forth like this keep like hand fitting this so you want to automate the, the power production exactly
