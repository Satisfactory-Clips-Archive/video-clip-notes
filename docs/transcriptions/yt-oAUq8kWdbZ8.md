> question about revamping spider coast there's a nice big plateau above the big waterfall towards doon desert is that plateau in the danger zone, I think I know which one you're thinking about that platoon, plateau is definitely in danger zone, generally if there's an area in the game that looks like underdeveloped which that plateau really does that plateau is just like a flat texture there's like nothing on it that's because we haven't started working on that yet so yes that that plateau will change I don't know if it will change like terrain wise, but that that definitely is working progress so do not move it there if you if you care about that stuff
