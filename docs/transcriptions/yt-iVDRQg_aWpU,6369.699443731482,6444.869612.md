### Transcript

> any teasers for what's coming next, no no not any teasers like we're just gonna be working more on update five to fix it up there I don't know if there are gonna be any more new things coming to update five I'm not sure I think the majority team is working on like yeah future stuff yeah, but we won't be doing any teasers anytime soon and the tricky thing with teasers is like it's hard to tease something in a good way when like that stuff isn't done yet you know like yeah we need to wait till like a lot of that work is finished so that we can actually show stuff to you you know eve even at the point where we do tea stuff it's like too early sometimes yeah yeah it's really close with update five so I will say though that we are planning to keep working on the dedicated servers so those will still you will still see like improvements to those more than like you would see to the regular game because I know there's still a few features that we want to implement from dedicated servers that we haven't done yet and that's going to keep happening, yeah and the dedicated servers are like, still in their infancy so to speak and so like it's, it's there's gonna be a lot more meaningful changes coming to that quicker than like the the main game itself yeah true story rock galactic enabled unreal
