> and i'm the Game Director at coffee stain studios.
> The initial idea of satisfactory was actually a base defense game.
> I remember it as it was yesterday,
> we were talking about game ideas, what can we do, what's a fun game.
> That was in the stage when we were starting to brainstorm
> for what's to come after Goat Sim[ulator].
> And this idea about a base defense game came up.
> It's like you need to go and you have to build everything from scratch.
> But its not crafting like survival crafting is,
> it's more Factorio inspired.
> So it actually started as a base defense game primarily,
> then the factory part got bigger and bigger,
> and the fighting part got smaller and smaller.
> So we actually just decided to not have that base defense aspect in at all.
> I mean obviously we had a lot of discussions about it,
> cause it's a very compelling type of gameplay.
> We felt that it went very contrary to the main part of the game.
> We felt that, if a part of the game loop is about
> counter acting what you are doing primarily,
> it doesn't really fit.
> The electricity goes out and suddenly you are..
> sure you have turrets but they can't do anything.
> So it's sort of the same problem, it's arguably even worse
> cause you did everything you could
> and then it's fucked anyway.
> That's why we got rid of it.
