### Transcript

> we've also we've added new kinds of pillars and also we've added a new build feature okay so this is a change to the build system that I'm going to demonstrate to you guys right now so if I go to build this metal pillar on the like hot bar thing down there you can see that there's an option called quick switch I can press e and what it does is I can press e to switch between different kinds of the same thing so there's a metal pillar press e there are now concrete pillars and there are also frame pillars and then I could switch back to metal pillar again so there are three different materials and, the the new base without the metal sticking up means that the base now works with whatever material you put down whether you put down the frame one the concrete one or the metal one the base works with it well so yeah there are three different kinds and, of course the these small pillars are the same I can use e to quick switch those as well so you've got different kinds of small pillars and also different kinds of big pillars that are now introduced and this quick switch feature now I'm telling you about quick switch right away because that feature is not just limited to pillars it's limited to a bunch of things it could be like foundations walls, railings a lot of things have quick switch functionality on them as well so as I go through this demonstration I'll demonstrate the, quick switch versions of things as well so you can see, how handy it really is so yeah okay so first thing that we're showing off is new pillars big ones as well as small ones and in three different, like materials or or, types I suppose all right so moving on
