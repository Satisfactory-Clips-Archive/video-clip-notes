> now I'm recording you guys hi my name is you will and I'm the sound designer at Causton studios good sound design is it sells you of the world it sells here the object that you're looking at but it doesn't annoy you and it doesn't bring you out of the day immersion I try to make stuff as we go like when we get a new equipment I try to make the sound for it we get a new building try to make the song for that I think that it's important that everything has a sound that's not always the case but they need to be like a minimal minimal feedback sound for stuff to be appropriately I can list or tested I guess a lot of the the feeling of something comes from the sunshine we have a fairly huge map and that has to be filled with a lot of different ambient sounds for a lot of different like varied ecological areas we've had help from some designer called Dennis Philip oh he's been doing great work and we couldn't really implement sounds the way that we've done in the past I looked at a talk from developers of Witcher 3 and they had some smart solutions to doing big world design we have some requirements early on for the ambient sound that it should sound alien that it was important that you feel that you weren't on earth it's harder than you think to do to make stuff sound alien like you want to give someone the feeling of being in the forest but you don't want them to hear the birds that they wake up to every day for factory buildings I usually try to find out what we linked us what is being processed what's being made trying to find something in real life but it's close to what I'm trying to replicate so for a minor for instance I would try to listen to our minor would sound in real life and usually the case is that yeah this sounds like in real life and no one would ever want to listen to it animation is very important for some time making sounds blind is very hard so it's it's good to have a close relationship to do stuff with us the animations though Yannick has been doing all the music I'm not the one that's in charge for for saying if it works a lot but I guess I'm the one that gives in the most such a pain in the book I'm also their sunshine but I do sometimes do a little programming objects with I sometimes help up with shitty video I use my supercilious I sound design tools to clean up all the noise reverbs Peaks

> for hardware I use sure you can do some design with a lot of hardware and it's really expensive I feel that I I got what I need when I have a sound card and when I have software my favorite thing that I've designed probably the scanning sound effects I did that for our internal alpha test two years ago and I did it in like 20 minutes and it survived up until now yeah hopefully we won't get too many the song sucks do it all again what if they say that then this don't show me let they say that releasing now face both scary and exciting at the same time for media some titles more scary of course we've been working on this for quite some while now and for a lot of people they are consonants they're like the first releasing of the game Malcolm calm face and release but this is going to be the first time that people get to see what we've been doing firsthand
