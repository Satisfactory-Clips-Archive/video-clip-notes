### Transcript

> yeah okay so that's a bunch of like
world changes that are coming some people have asked can we
please get like a kind of like map so we can see
what's kind of being worked on and what's being changed and i've prepared a
couple maps for you actually so the first map that we're gonna look
at is this first map here and this map here is actually just a map of just
the changes that are coming in Update 5 So you can see that the Northern
Forest and the Dune Desert has some work being done to it
you can also see that we have a couple categories down there Category B and C you might be wondering &quot;where's A and D?&quot; we'll talk about that in a second
so Category B with mild to significant foliage changes, landscape changes
may impact your factory Category C
mild to significant foliage changes In this case like in the Northern Forest
foliage changes are significant but you can take care of those with chainsaws
for example with a minor landscape polish
unlikely to impact your factory So those are the changes that are
coming in Update 5 now i have another map for you which is actually
sort of our roadmap for map changes
