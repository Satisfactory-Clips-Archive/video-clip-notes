> some people asking about Legend five, we could say what we've said before which is that we've been investigating under Legend five and I could say that it's like I think when we first started investigating we're like ah we'll just investigate for funsies but then like nowadays we're like actually this could be you know not bad no things are going probably better than we initially thought so we don't know we'll see we'll see how it goes we still need to figure things out can't really promise anything at this stage and even if we did the other thing is like even if we did go to Unreal Engine 5 I think a lot of people have a lot of expectations of what that will mean for the game so like if we ever do that we're gonna have to make like a video to make it really clear what you should expect with that change because you don't just get everything with the engine that you've seen in Tech demos yeah, when everything was built on the engine before, all that kind of stuff yeah so we'll see we have to measure the expectations yeah the temporary expectations exactly because even I've tried, using some of the new features in my own personal projects in some cases the performance is actually worse using like Lumen and, and nanites yep so it depends is the classic so yeah
