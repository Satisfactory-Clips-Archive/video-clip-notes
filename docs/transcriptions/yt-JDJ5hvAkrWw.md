> does obscuring belts actually help with performance, it kind of depends, we have tested it and you do get a little bit of gain I think, the thing you sacrifice when you obscure the items is like clarence, sorry not clearance, clarence clarence like, what's the word like the it becomes less clear what's going on like, it's harder to play the game so while you gain a little bit of performance it makes the game a little bit harder to play so we've thought of like adding something for people that need it or want it or something like that where you can like optionally do it I don't know if that's when that's gonna happen or if it's gonna happen or if it's just like a prototyping thing we did and just feel like nah it wasn't good but we have tried that at least
