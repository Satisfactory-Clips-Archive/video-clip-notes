### Transcript

> I will answer this question last so will there be support for steam workshop since release date no steamworks, we don't have official mod support in the game yet when we do that's when we'll ask ourselves the question, if if the best rat is to go steamworks or you know if we should do our own solution or something or like what we're gonna do we don't know yet because we don't have proper mod support yet and, but I think maybe like I think it makes sense, and, same thing on on epics and like- I think, around the time when we have proper mod support I think at that time epic will probably have implemented their version of of mod support I think it's in the roadmap that it's going to be fairly soon as well not that I don't think that's going to impact us in any way like in our decision to have proper mod support because we got to get dedicated servers out first and dedicated servers is taking us a bit more time than we thought so, but but when when we do get proper mod support maybe we'll use steamworks probably maybe I don't know so sounds like it's it's a good way to do it so see we'll see
