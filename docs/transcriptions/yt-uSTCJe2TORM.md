> will it be possible to set ratios of items for programmable splitters so a lot of people, request that and like so it's like that's one of those things where you know it could be good it seems like a natural choice and maybe it's a thing that we'll end up doing but there's a pretty strong argument against it as well and that is that that removes that gameplay element completely basically it's really really overpowered if we if we let you just set ratios, it's the same kind of thing with like how we were hesitant to add mass, product, mass building and like you know there's zooping now but that's still constrained to a certain, limit because it takes away large parts of the gameplay and I would say ratio is even more so because it takes away some of the challenge and the problem solving and the way you need to think about how you use space it gets rid of all of that, I like I know that's that's hard to do but that's the point like that's the challenge right so like that's the argument to not do it, or one of the arguments to not do it yeah it's, obviously it's one of those like contenders for like it it could optimize away the fun of the game yeah it's always like a for a game designer there's there's always the thing like if you if you as a player can optimize away the fun out of the game you will always do it, you would always take the shorter path, lippora gates here I zoom twice on sundays whether I need it or not wow happy for you yeah I'm happy for you, but, yeah like it's it's certainly a thing that we what not me and jay specifically but like we have that internal discussion so we will see what comes out of it we'll see and we'll keep you guys updated twice on sundays this can make a good pizza true yeah like my galleon points out here as well like why do pipes have valves but like the the belts don't have a similar, feature and and the pipe the fluid mechanics are more complex in the game, so they they have more urgency than being able to set ratios have, there's there's yeah there's this less like what's it called like abstraction layer of like understanding of of the the piping and what it actually happens when you split it and sometimes like the back the one thing actually that's brought up in this video by total and the medallions, guide as well is like something that not a lot of people realize is that there's there's a concept of like back, slashing backflow, and the the the thing was that the only way people found like really consistently to get around that was to put pumps like on horizontal lines to stop that because pumps stop, backflow and then since that already exists in the game it also made more sense for us to like all right but well if people are kind of like working around that already and we can't remove pumps and we can't really remove that feature then it makes more sense as well to have valves, yeah so there's like a few more like they're not really comparable is what I'm trying to get here, because there's more to it than than just ratio splitting when it comes to valves they serve multiple purposes
