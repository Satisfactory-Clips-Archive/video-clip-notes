### Transcript

> if you have plans to alter the current map what about bases we're already set up will those wind up total or um so what's going to happen is the uh that's kind of already happened a couple of times what's gonna happen is there's just the environment just gonna plop up and if your factory is built there it's just gonna pop out through your factory um so bummer there are some areas that i don't recommend people building in um like the the water like on top of the waterfall in dune desert where if you see an area where like it just looks empty and you feel like there should be something there it's probably because there's gonna be something there um yeah the big flat big no exactly there are uh there was like a mountain that appeared in an update three for for a couple of people so there's a video of someone just like inside the mountain with the hub being like well guess i'm stuck here yeah i just wake up in the middle of a forest of fart rocks exactly that can't happen um but this is also why we haven't been pushing world updates as regularly as we used to because it's annoying when this keeps happening over and over again so we'd rather save it for like special occasions um and i don't know exactly when the next world update is going to happen but we are debating whether or not it's going to be the next update or the update after that um
