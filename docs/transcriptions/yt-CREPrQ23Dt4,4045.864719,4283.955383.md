### Transcript

> so yeah if you guys have any questions about blueprints feel free to shoot them our way like while we're doing this, because this is not like this is we don't have like we didn't play it anything no no we didn't have a plan anything so we're just going to talk generally about Blueprints and like the designs we were working so hard yeah so we can start off a little bit like we can start off a little bit like sort of the I talked a little bit in the video on the major Decisions by blueprints because we've talked about this a long time about how like if we ever do blueprints it's not going to be just like copy this part and paste it there there's been a lot of like work on like what makes it like figuring out what makes blueprints work in satisfactory because like like I said in the video like it ruins a big part of the game if you're just able to just like copy paste everything willy-nilly, so, I think it was Qantas who pitched the like idea of having like a building yeah, I don't know when he he recently told me again when he made when he thought he made the pitch but it's a pretty old one yeah I think it's from backend update five he made the concept for it yeah and we've stayed very stayed very true to the the concept as well remarkably Drew actually yeah like the Prototype like the markup State mock-ups he'd done was like it's basically Less Pretty version of what we have which I think is kind of amazing it's it's identical to the Prototype, building we had I think because it was the the Prototype mock-up was just like beams and then the ramp and like are you talking about oh yeah when we were looking into how the the model yeah yeah work yeah yeah we built like a thing with beans oh yeah oh right yeah yeah to try it out and when when I when we were going when we're making the trailer or the teaser video I saw that mock-up and I thought that was the model first and I was like I don't we have it like celine's like we don't have like we don't have the model yet but I'm like but I'm looking at it it's in game it's done yeah, but yeah it's kind of it's kind of, interesting because I think one thing for for my perspective is like it's kind of hard to gauge sort of how Community would sort of you know take blue like if you say if we were just to say you know hey we're making Blueprints and that was it I think a lot of people in our community would have a lot of different ideas as how they want blueprint to work and I think in in a lot of cases you don't really need know until you try it sort of what makes sense or not because it sounds good on paper that you're just able to just click copy paste everything and just no builds huge manifold of whatever but I think, from our point of view like satisfactory has always been sort of the Minecraft idea that like you are painstakingly putting everything together so yeah and I still think there's like different opinions and that's probably why there were discussions in the past I mean it's the same thing for zooping right where there was this idea that you had to kind of build everything by hand and there's certainly satisfaction that comes from that but we also realized that there's a lot of tedium there and one thing that I was really happy with when we did the zooping is that realization that now you suddenly have way more time to do other decorative stuff in your factory and you burn out less quickly from the game actually just allowing you to do more fun stuff yeah and I think it's going to be the same with the with the blueprints yeah we have to find that balance because we don't just want people like you explained already in the video I like to just plop down entire Factory lines we kind of want them to puzzle around with it make modular pieces maybe share ideas with each other yeah and really keep the gameplay alive and they're rather than just it becoming a copy paste yeah I don't I mean I don't know if you guys remember how tedious it used to be to place I think of 4096 signs at once no it was really tedious right right but now oh you mean again no no you can just do it over and over yeah we all need four thousand oh you know who you are but, yeah like I completely forgot what am I trying to thought there
