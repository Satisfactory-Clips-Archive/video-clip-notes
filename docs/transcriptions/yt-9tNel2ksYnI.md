> given steam achievements already I think we're gonna wait until 1.0 until we give steam achievements, no not november update you ha no you gotta have the nut the cup it's the cup update, speaking of cups I wonder what the state of that is on the merch side I think we're we are working towards the cup but I don't know how far away we are from that anyway cup date oh so good I guess update 3 was the cupcake because I think we had it anyway, so [ __ ] I completely lost track of my channel yeah so steam achievements, we're probably not gonna add achievements to the game until we're closer to finalizing it, just because you know you can't change achievements once they've gone live you can add achievement you can't change the current ones so if we rebalance the game or something like that we're kind of screwed, so we're gonna wait as for as long as we can before we add achievements, for all you achievement hunters out there, epic also added their achievement system now so both epic and steam versions can have the achievement system now but we're probably gonna wait
