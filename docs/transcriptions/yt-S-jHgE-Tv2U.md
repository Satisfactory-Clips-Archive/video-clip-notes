> especially not at this at this stage we don't feel like it's really worth implementing controlled support now if anything we'll try and get it for 1.0 but we don't know we don't know if if, if there's still a couple of changes coming to the game and we still aren't super hundred percent sure that they will work with controllers I know there are like controller mappings right now that work fully but, we there's still things that we want to change with the game so we we'd rather wait until all the ui elements and all that stuff is in place before we introduce control support because otherwise that introduces so much extra work for us and that delays the entire game so that's why we rather do it at the end if we do it at all

> but we we don't know at this stage essentially because we we it's it's like it's it's a risk for us introducing control support now for the whole production because we need to maintain that if we do and we don't feel confident that we can do that while we're also developing the game at the pace we're doing so yes
