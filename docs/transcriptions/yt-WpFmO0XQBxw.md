> why would epic outage impact local dedicated servers this is maybe we'll talk about this next week because I need to prepare a little bit but because I think I don't think people understand how complicated multiplayer games are, multiplayer games there's a lot of services that kind of like service you to be able to play online, I know that it's like this is kind of like also the the downfall of doing it but like a lot of times when we talk about multiplayer we always dumb it down and be like yeah when you're playing online like our game is peer-to-peer right or it can be if you're not playing a dedicated server but essentially it's just like yeah but I just on my machine I talk to that computer and then we play together like it that's a very dumb down like verse like version of what actually is happening when you're playing through like through network there's a lot of going on the back end and we're using epic online services which is not the same thing as epic games launcher these are two completely different things, epic online services is is a great like framework and set of tools that anyone can utilize for games or for anything else to to do various different things there's a bunch of different services the one major thing that we're using is for is kind of like configuring play if you will it's not really matchmaking but that's kind of what it is because matchmaking also entails like mmr and like that kind of stuff but really it's it's really like if you have two computers being able to communicate with each other through routers and through network configurations is very complicated and epic online services what we're using it for is is like a layer to make sure that these two computers get hooked up together and talk to each other and if that service is down then if you're utilizing those services to to play together and they're not working then you're you're you're kind of yeah you're you're in the bone so I've seen some people just, dump words in chat so like they're stunned which is a way to like I won't go too much into this actually, maybe we'll do it next week I can you know pull up the diagram and stuff like that and actually like here's how epic online services work and maybe we can use that for for our camera or something like that, if you guys are into it that but just know that like you don't just connect to another computer it never it doesn't work like that there's a lot of stuff going on, and there's a lot of things that can go wrong as well like it's like networking is very complicated it's amazing that you know internet works the way that it does

> so so yeah we're using an epic online services for that and if that service goes down then it we you can't connect essentially and we could have used any service we could have made our own service which I've done in the past and that's a lot of work, you have to host service and stuff like that and it's it's it's a lot of work steam does, offer some of these services, but if we would have gone with steam's services then we wouldn't have cross-play we wouldn't had like some of the features that we have in the game that we now utilizing for dedicated servers, so that's why we're not using steems services and there are many other services to do the same thing like for instance right now like they launched final fantasy right they made their own complete system for this and that's that's like making a separate game essentially in terms of like resources needed to make that stuff so all right rant over, networking as hell I just- I love seeing people that just chime in with like yeah it it's so hard like people just don't get it like people in general I think take internet for granted like there's so much intricacy going on, so yeah anyway
