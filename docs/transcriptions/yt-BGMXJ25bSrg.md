> i kind of like my weird coal stack now's the hard part where i need to actually make it work that's when i stopped playing the game i mean that that is true for a lot of people actually as soon as you get pipes involved pipes are really like unintuitive i feel still whenever i like join in on on someone's streaming and they're playing cole for the first time and even though people are explaining like how pipes work for them it's still like it's not super obvious like what they're doing wrong when they're not getting headlifts sometimes sometimes they can really look like the the menu is showing you like there's the pipe is full and then they have like a little slant and then it divides and then like wait but it's only fall up to that slant and then it's but that's not what the menu tells you so i hope we get a chance to work more on the ux part of that um and obviously fix the the bugs that do exist but the bugs that do exist usually only affect people that uh have bigger uh pipe setups like i think it's a much more bigger problem that our pipes are just not intuitive uh than the save load thing which is annoying as well but you know that one at least we kind of know what we need to do to fix they're bloody pipes it's not rocking science well it is it is kind of rocking science actually like we've actually had a couple of people that uh work with uh fluid dynamics that have reached out to us and be like i'm so glad that you guys didn't do proper fluid dynamics because that is confusing and i don't think anyone actually would enjoy working with like actual proper fluid dynamics it is a little bit dumbed down
