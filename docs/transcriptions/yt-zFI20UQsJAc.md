### Transcript

> so yeah then simon, what was the word first he he blocked it out in blender as like the 3d animation and then he tracked the actual footage and then he added the the blenders on top of it and then the last step is oh easy shader like actually using a shader easy shader this is notes here thanks for the reset brother and, and then he brings it over to resolve and color tries to like color match it because it's kind of tricky to get like if you have one color grade in in blender and then you're comping it on top of actual footage, it's it's tricky as hell to get it to look you know realistic the problem with this shot is that it's not shot in log color, profile which is a logarithmic color it's supposed to be though right, no he couldn't film it with this drone okay, because he had the the dude who made these drone shots he had like different type of drones and, he needed to use a smaller drone to be able to like fly close to the building yeah so he was telling me about this actually there's like some regulations that it's like, i might be getting the wrong metric here but i think it was weight of the drone or something and if it's, like i'm pulling a number on my ass here but if it's like you know 500 grams or something or or a specific size then you're not allowed to be within a hundred meters of a building yeah so they actually sell drones that are like one unit shorter than that yeah, just so you can get around the and yeah yeah and the drone was small it was like this big it was like really small yeah it was a dji mini pro 2 or something i think sure if if anyone's savvy or care about that stuff and they're really small yeah so so and that and the trade-off there is that it can't shoot in a logarithmic color profile, which makes it a little harder to color match it, but simon [ __ ] pulled it off, and, actually you had, maybe we can do this after this but it would be cool to show what just the default log looks like yeah we can do that yeah yeah so we'll finish this and then we'll show log yep yeah i can show you like what it looks like before and after color readings yeah yeah yeah that would be cool and yeah we ended up with this next strong shot yeah great job simon big shout out chilly stream chat right that's simon chilly's sorry i'm outing you man most people know already but this is simon
