### Transcript

> could you give some info about the revamp of the creature remain system I appreciate the concept of finding more uses for the remains but turning into protein to turning into capsules seems a little redundant to me outside of mam unlocks and the protein scenes so like the main reason why we added that extra step was that you need that to create the to be able to sync it in the power sync, the creature changes that we did was that we wanted we wanted exploration to be a bit more rewarding so that's why we added so that you can use the creature remains to get points in the awesome sink and we also added that like special track in the awesome sync so that points would still be valuable even if you've already sunk a lot of points into like with your parts and, so you get get easy tickets, so that's the main reason why we revamped it with that in mind there's also a couple of like yeah like you mentioned the ma'am unlocks is a bit different but the main thing really why we changed the protein thing was because we wanted it to be used for, awesome sync and then it made sense to add that extra step in the in the chain so it's not just like you just like don't throw it away you actually have to manufacture it do something with it yeah
