> time in this video this actually took
> like four days four days to film so
> we'll have to we'll have to push back
> the update one week sorry my bad we'll
> be putting the patch up on an
> experimental branch on the 30th of April
> so you can still test it then the
> experimental branch will be in your epic
> game store library as a separate game so
> you can use that to test it I recommend
> just backing up your save files just in
> case the patch notes will also be
> released then on the 30th of April once
> we feel that the patch on the
> experimental branch is stable we'll move
> it over to the main branch this could
> take a couple days hopefully not more
> than a week but we want to make sure
> that it is stable before we do that
> we'll get it out there as soon as
> possible I know that something you
> probably don't want another satisfactory
> game like the experimental branch in
> your library I personally wouldn't that
> it is the only solution we have right
> now but we'll figure out something more
