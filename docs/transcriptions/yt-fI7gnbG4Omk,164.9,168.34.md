> hi I'm Christopher and I'm the animator Costain studios when I started I worked on a little bit on sanctum one like their last the DLC and then I was almost part of the home sanctum two series and then also the goat simulator six seven years six years eight seven years six six to seven years around six six and I actually checked how many missions we have in a dungeon it was 1,100 like animation files animation sequences and then there's like none spaces and not everything is used and some more just like posters so just like one frame how many animators are me and the or tractor used to be animator as well but now he's moved on to alter action when we do trailers and it's like animation having a working dog character does some of it we basically try to do it so I do monster animations and he does like every other editing and like planning and stuff like that my favorite thing is first personal mission because the second animation that's like directly controlled by the player so you need to be very clear on what you're showing and not like make it feel responsive and like not like sluggish and stuff like that I find that you can found that like kind of a challenge you you also try have like some sort of personality or something to the animation so you can like show what kind of character it is but with machines it's like yeah it's a machine so it doesn't really have a personality per se but you can you can try and do like small things the nuclear reactor example the old one and the portable miner it's more about character than a machine it's like a little rope or kinda it's kind of like it does its thing when he has like squinty eyes when he's pushing down on the ground like so it's also they're like the design of the machine or like the football miner he looks like a character and it looks like it has personally the space elevator really like noticed players pushing the bottom and then nothing happens so okay we have to add something I didn't really know what to do with it so you have to like make something up that's not like you should we don't know what it does it's like short your sock and then like shoots it away and it's like yeah sure maybe like it's something had to be there and yeah how to do it in pretty short amount of time so just did something the creatures like some of the creatures might not like like have similarities to like rebirth creatures then it's kind of a hard together like a feel of what kind of movement to Fisk out there should they have when it's like super weird and like the legs are backward or whatever that can be kind of hard I would say I work very closely with all of the disciplines everything from like concept you want to be there from Vienna so you can like ask about like you know is this your house this thing and then it's like design obviously because they what they decide it's kind of like drive the animation or it like you have mr. restrain certain restrictions depending what they want for like authoring and implementing missions in the game we talk to programmers and and I said everyone and then I just got sound you're like can I cut that in yesterday and sound of course no sure so I think I've done most of the particle effects electrician effects in the game not all of them I think you're Hannah's from a couple of the responsibilities as you know me when a new ones gonna come in I'm from animation and effects also trying to help and a camera if I shoot reference it's really useful to have like to act it out and like you see so much like many shoot reference that you miss if you just like trying to do it from your head when I get border I kind of like to do some stupid things and then I usually try to put some Easter eggs in there it could be like you someone says something may be fun if it will be from and then you just trying to it I guess like the most people have found this like the the naruto run yeah i can't really remember how it came to be I think it's just like a meme right so like yeah sure would be fun if it was like a stupid ninja room there's not a lot of thought goes into this if I watch like a video people playing the game they don't say anything like bad about it okay it's very cool to nurse to serum like stop and watch a little portal minor and then be like oh cool so I guess that's like yeah that's really nice who's your favorite person in the office the view was neither I didn't wanna miss 50 you did what what's not one of us we bunk bye everyone bye
