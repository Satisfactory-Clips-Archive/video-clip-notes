> today are two different kinds of patches that we plan on doing the first kind is larger content updates they're you know they're bigger new things are released like trains for example then there are also smaller bug fix patches and those are for the smaller bugs that are kind of critical between the big content patches so that we can fix things so people can keep playing or whatever the bigger content update patches aren't always just reliant on the big feature that they will also include many many different like quality of life updates and stuff as well now those things may be ready earlier you know we may finish a quality-of-life update this week but we're not going to release it until the end of the month and the reason for that is we want to group as many things into one update as possible so even if we have part of the content for the big content update patch ready like for example a lot of smaller quality of life fixes we're still going to hold it off until the end of the month we don't want to keep updating every single week unless it's they're critical bugs that need fixing and the reason for that is because even putting in a small update a small quality of life update can introduce a large issue so what we want to do is we want to make sure that we spend enough time testing any fix that we do and if we group them all up into one big content update patch then we only have to test that one
