> welcome everybody welcome to the stream yeah people are using the new emote so we can see that hell yeah status muted that's it that's an emote that will probably come yes yes yes yes yes we did have, we started working on that but then, it wasn't good enough it didn't hold up to the quality standards of our stream exactly it's a little bit hard to get like a like you know like the no sound symbol kind of thing but in a way that is related to satisfactory and a way that is also very easily readable so, you know we'll probably figure something out because we know people want it and, yeah so so shout outs to torsten okay who is our art director right we've had him on stream before and he's on our youtube channel before as well, yeah we were like yo we want to get some emotes and he's like I love doing small little pictures and I haven't done that in a while so I would love to do it and then in like 24 hours he just sends us like 10 emotes and we're like whoa you know we didn't have to revise anything we were like that's that's pretty much perfect you did it great and, yeah so it was it was pretty gnarly yeah how easily he could do it it's yeah it's super super satisfying just like [ __ ] ever almost every design he made like every moment was just like spot on perfect yeah like no feedback from us whatsoever just like yep well take it [ __ ] nailing the assignment 10 out of 10. a plus plus so if you can't see the emotes by the way all right you need to go you need the better ttv plug-in I think that's only available on browsers you can't get that on on mobile or anything like that as far as I know, so you just need to, get the just get that plug and put it in and then you can see other people put using the emotes and you can use the emotes yourself as well yes and here's the selection here's the, the current, selection of emotes that we have they've been hand-picked by yours and I love the I love the set status pogo oh the status it's such a good name on that email yeah listen yeah I [ __ ] lost my mind when I saw that name yeah [ __ ] five yeah these are the emotes so bettertv.com is the website you need to go to get the plugin if you want to use it I believe you said it but what was what was the command for, the emotes it should be in the the stream title which is just exclamation point oh okay, it's- I put it in and it's not working the command but people have used it before I have seen the command work before so maybe it's just like this timed out or something yeah yeah I don't know it's probably fine there we go it just popped up
