> pipes are not seen to be bound by Logic there's a lot of stuff in the game that isn't Bound by Logic I always find it very interesting when people talk about like what's realistic and not in the game because sometimes people will get very upset about one thing not being realistic in the game and they're like oh can't play this game unplayable it's like you've accepted the fact though that there's like flying out of your build gun out of thin air but having waterfalls from faucets that's right out foreign but- I honestly no but- I know I sound facetious when I say this but I'm actually really curious about it because it is it is a part of like the game design sort of Mantra I guess it's more yeah I know it's more ux I'm not sure where within what field it lies but I think it's interesting where people are susceptible to what is okay and realistic and what isn't within the game, environments I think that's really interesting I think some reasoning is very dumb around it but I think it's a very interesting like concept by itself like why some people think like this is a realistic game or why some people think that you know some Physics are considered realistic in some games even though physics in all games are very flawed yeah that suspension of discipline yeah exactly like what where where that line is drawn and how it like is different for people I think that's very interesting because it varies so much from people to from person to person and every person thinks that they're like, their line is like where it should be drawn for everyone what is the deal with airplane food Foundation float miners don't yeah like why is that okay like why is it okay that foundations can float but having water coming out of a faucet that's right out crazy yeah it's true it's it's like depending on also what genre you're you're playing like that's that like sense of disbelief is also different because we accept even but even if it's like fantasy we still accept some rules to be you know find and then it ties into story like it's the whole it's a field that needs to be researched I think it's very interesting
