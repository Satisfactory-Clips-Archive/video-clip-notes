> one more thing I'd like to touch upon is that there is there's still a few issues with update four that we're trying to solve mostly these are mostly related to like you know people not being able to get into the the game and like not being able to join each other on multiplayer we're still trying to figure out exactly what are causing these issues they've been really tricky to solve for some reason both because it's really hard to like reproduce all the issues but even now when we can reproduce some of the issues they've still been like we're not quite sure exactly what's going on and I think part of that is because we've done such a huge like engine upgrade to to the game and that introduces like so many new like changes to how the engine function and it it can introduce like bugs that we didn't really anticipate or maybe didn't even notice until it actually is live stuff like that, and yeah this it's it's a it's a mess sometimes handling all that architectural like changes with unreal engines, but we're still trying to solve that we're hoping to get that fix out for both ea and experimental, we're currently running experimental I believe with a few patches for some of the issues also, so there is there's currently an ea and experimental running right now but there's not a huge difference between the two so like if you're having issues on experimental you can switch back to ea and if you're having issues in ea then it might get resolved in experimental, so bear with us a little bit longer on that regard we're still trying to solve that and, cool good I said it that was a really good spiel dude a spiel yeah 10 out of 10. I'm out of my system cool
