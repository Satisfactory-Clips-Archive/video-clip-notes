> can we get a snowball can we get back to snowball pile maybe salt recipe, well the snowball pile is is all like fixes sniff so you don't want to remove that actually we can talk about one thing that was was in fixmas but we're probably gonna bring it back to the game because I think it was, confirmed right chase I don't know what you're talking about the the the the thing the, wait my dad's just sent me a text yeah yeah, I actually don't know if that was or not but I think it's probably fine to talk about okay we might bring back the packager game to the game to be like an actual like easter egg and not just fix miss tide we'll see that makes sense yeah because it wasn't really fixmas themed per se no it was like fixmas themed and sends like your rapping presence but I think a lot of people really like that minigame and, and you know you can I think it's like thematic anyway when you're like wrapping up packages and sending them up in the space they drop shipping you know so it's kind of like it makes sense outside of fixmaster I think or maybe you like maybe we'll make it so that you unlock it or in some ways it's not by default I don't know but I feel like we talked about it internally and felt that I might bring it back
