### Transcript

> can we still skip the nuclear part for energy production or is nuclear needed for some other production lines uh as of now no you could play the whole game i guess without ever getting nuclear we are ramping up the power usage though with tier 8 now coming in for example the blender even though we don't know you exactly how much power it's going to be using because we first want to finish the part balancing and know how many the average player will kind of need uh we know that it's going to be quite expensive on the power and there will be more things coming in with tier 8 that are also really expensive on power so we're kind of trying to push home the need for the nuclear generators gotcha but you could theoretically of course just completely forego them and just go for turbo fuel if you want to do that gotcha
