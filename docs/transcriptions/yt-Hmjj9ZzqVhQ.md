### Transcript

> can you get started on the next thing while I, you mean the state of dev oh I sure can let me tell you all about it, we're still working on the game, we're working towards the, we're trying to figure out what we're calling this like minor update that we're releasing, at the start of november like it's it's the november update it's we've we've like half called it like oh I just died in the stream we've half called it like 3.5 because it's like half like it's a half between three and four right but then 3.5 version is already out so we can't use that, so so yeah we're working on that we're working on, figuring out what what's actually gonna make it in because some things are set in stone like this is definitely what's making it in in that version, 3.56 I think is the version that is gonna be released, lord stewie but it's I think it's three five five now wait let me check stream wait can you oh never mind, 3.75, so yeah naming is difficult but, it is a minor update that's coming and we're right now figuring out exactly probably what's going to make it in there's only a few weeks left it's not long until like it's out or it'll be done yeah we can also talk about what, what we're gonna tease, did you say when we're playing when we're planning on releasing it or planning on teasing it, no we're releasing it okay yeah so it looks like last of october yeah well not the last of the like the last week or so we're still calling it the november update yeah we're still gonna call it the november update we think it's gonna be out end of october yeah but it's it's definitely the november december update our our producer gave us a very like yeah it's like 80 certain or 20 not certain and we're like yes yeah I asked him I was like so by end of october when in november do you mean yeah, but we'll see maybe we'll delay it until december just for kicks and shits or no you never know with us, but we're gonna probably tease fairly soon what's gonna actually be in that because we actually kind of know now or like me yeah we actually know actually got informed what's actually in the next coming days we like there's a chance that there'll be something this week there's a there's a chance, but we probably won't have it ready in time but next week there will be, some teasing slash information, the current plan is to to do with teas on youtube and then explain on the stream after that's the current theory we'll see if we stick to that or not and yeah you know it's us so it's probably not going to happen we're probably going to change everything last they can be like no yeah let's make an art installation and and we'll cosplay the update on the street, but I think you guys are gonna be hype for it, even though it's a minor website it's got a few really cool stuff in it there's a few things in this update that a lot of people have been bugging us about so it's gonna be nice it's it's honestly going to be somewhat of a quality of life update but there are absolutely new things in it as well yeah I like how you said instead of like it's not oh there's been stuff that a lot of people in the community requested it's now it's a lot of stuff that you guys are just annoying us about like [ __ ] won't shut up about it yep we told them we told them to make it so that we could have an easier time exactly I mean that's pretty much our job right it's just like we're trying to get community out of our ass we go to our producer and be like can you please do this so
>

>
> they won't they won't stop heckling us about this oh I wish that that was how it worked, in some ways it does you know because because like your your feedback and requests and stuff yeah our like are listened to yeah and we run to them and be like they want this but again chad like this is a minor update this is an update for big so like, but it's cool it's cool yeah but you don't like it too much you'll be disappointed if you think too much yeah it won't be lights I can tell you that much it isn't lights now and it isn't signs sorry guys yeah,
