> two body slots maybe uh i don't think two bodice plots is gonna happen uh i think we'd rather do fix the entire like equipment system rather than um just add another body slot because you feel too overpowered when you have two body spots um there's also like the other reason why we don't like so so like just to clarify something here we don't like the one body slot thing either right because there are situations where like you can't use the hover pack and the hazmat suit at the same time for instance right and that's kind of problematic which means that there are items in the game that you can't utilize to their full extent right so we don't like that system either but we don't like the two body slot system either because that is like a bit too overpowered and it kind of like makes some equipment redundant um and we don't we don't feel like that's good design either so what we're gonna do probably is like we implement how the equipment works in the game rather than just add on the body slot um so so we'll see what happens there no decisions has been made as far as i know um but yeah
