> cool what else it's in the update, let's check the patch notes the patch not should be on Reddit and on our Discord and stuff like that I'm actually gonna double check that real quick it worked to his job, 240 water for nuclear power plant yeah 244 for nuclear power plant that's pretty sweet so we made a decision there to go 240. that we said it was like we were probably gonna do 240 but we actually decided to do 240. yeah I mean that's the maximum number yeah but it's also the one that I think lines up best for the one that the ratios line up in the pipe amounts yeah yeah that made sense, so if you already have any power setups at the moment like the only downside right now is that you'll be feeding too much water like your power production will still work right yeah, and like the easy solution right now is just down clock your, your under clock your your fuel extract water extractors there you go God damn it I need to get there I believe in you yeah yeah yeah, and that way you'll get 100 efficiency again if you if you care about that stuff, which I know a lot of people do yes, I think that's most like like we said this is this is a small update like I know people are like oh blueprints they lied it's not a small update it is a small update like I think it's like blueprints and then yeah and that's it a couple of other things but, I know that blueprints are is like a huge game changer for a lot of people and and, it is it is in a lot of other people's eyes it is a big change and I guess it is so it's like, it's you know let's meet halfway it's like a big small medium it's medium sized, you know standard update like in terms of like patch notes like content lists it's not a lot going on but like the features themselves are pretty beefy, and, I think I think a lot of people are getting a lot of out of this update as well, so depending on what kind of play style you had because I think you gotta we're kind of like going for each place that player like archetype right now because update ticks were all about exploration and like the people that really care about exploration got something out of that and now we're going to watch like the forward you know the hardcore like Factory building people that like really care about like setting up complex stuff and now they're getting something, so, we're getting there zip line yeah zip
