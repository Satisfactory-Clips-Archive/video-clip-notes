### Transcript

> It's been some time now, yes,
but we're finally releasing an experimental version
 of dedicated server support. And when we say experimental,
we mean experimental. We're pretty sure
there's still a bunch of bugs when playing on the dedicated servers,
but at least they're out there now, so y'all can help us by trying them out
and sending us your feedback. Wow, what a day! That's a lot of stuff coming 
to Update 5, Snutt.
