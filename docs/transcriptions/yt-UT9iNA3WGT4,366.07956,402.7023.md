> it was hard to find a place where i felt like i could belong and in every quest it felt like i found my family there and at some point i actually was talking more with people in the game than i was talking with people in real life around me and i actually had my first boyfriend in everquest as well i always loved drawing and writing and making my own characters and stories but my teachers were always like you should find a real job like find something you can make money with and i didn't realize that you could you could make a living with working in games i grew up with my father and brother and my father and i shared a computer until i was 12 and on that computer we played the same games so it was an interest that we shared and that we could talk about together after school i worked as a chef in several restaurants and i did this for around five years and although i enjoyed it it was also lonely because i didn't really fit in with the men or the women there that was when i found the games education in breda in the netherlands when i saw those teachers and i saw that they were still making games but also teaching about games that was when i realized i can do this for a living i can do this as my career this was the first point in my life where i felt like i i wasn't the awkward person because everybody around me was kind of awkward and that's why we all enjoyed being together 2013 that's when i started my games education in breda i was surrounded by a lot of guys because it's still like a lot of guys in games but that's when i met hannah i was practically born telling stories when i couldn't write yet i would tell them to my parents and when i when i learned to write i would just never stop writing most of my childhood i was an outcast of some sort and most of my time was also spent in fictional universes both my own and other peoples i became a writer because i love stories and most of the stories that i read never really had people like me as the hero or the sidekick even so it was up to me to create those my dad was a programmer we were i think the first in our neighborhood to have a pc and we would play games together on it and it just was love at first sight when i graduated high school i just didn't really know what to do what i did was i just went to work animal shelter i was a dishwasher at a restaurant and i spent most of my other time writing then my mom sent me a link to this university where they made games and i never really thought that was something people could do so yeah i went there we went to the open day and it just felt right these were my people this was my place at first it seemed like i was the only woman there so when i saw another woman i immediately went up to her and was like hey cool tattoo and it turned out to be natalie in environments like this finding another woman is like finding a safe haven in the first week we immediately started with game projects and i ended up being the team leader while i had no idea what i was doing and that's when i met adam i was born in a russian-speaking family in estonia being a russian descent i didn't really feel like i fully belonged to estonian community but when i visited russia i didn't really feel like i fit in there either so the thoughts about leaving to work and study abroad were always present in my mind i never really played with dolls i only had dragons and monsters i was rather geeky and i liked to play on my own i always loved drawing and painting but i knew i should strive for something more than traditional arts my father introduced me to games at early age we used to spend a lot of time at his office playing starcraft and quake that gave me an idea that maybe one day i can make art for games at the university i felt like i need to work super hard so i can prove myself and break into the industry so after one week i met hannah and she was a project lead for our game i thought she she's so cool and she knew everything in my last year of university it was time to find an internship i played sanctum back when it came out so i wrote a letter to the studio that made that game which is coffee stain and they are inhibda and i thought how do you even say skip the cliff i had no idea it turned out that they were actually looking for a ui designer at that time so it was a perfect match one year later after i finished my internship i was hired by coffee stain and i decided to drive here with my two cats and since then i've been here and it's really good i ended up going to france for an internship but it ended up not being that great right at that time natalie contacted me and she told me about her internship and that they were looking for a level designer i applied immediately and i really hoped that sweden would turn my luck around and it did i felt like i belonged there like i mattered so i stayed right after the university i was hired by a studio in sweden though it wasn't in hilfte but in stockholm it was good in many ways but after a few years i felt like it's time to move on and that's when i got in contact with coffee stain through hannah i had a really good interview with the management but what really convinced me to join was when i came to visit the studio and spent some time with natalie and hannah it felt like a place where i could belong to from the get-go i have a lot of artistic freedom and creative responsibility how can we make a heart with free yes like this
