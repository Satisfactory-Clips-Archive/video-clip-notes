### Transcript

> when's the next ea update the next yeah update it's probably gonna be today maybe potentially we wanted to do it earlier because, but we had some issues with our build system or something, but we're gonna merge over the experimental branch to ea sometime this week at the latest, this week is a little bit awkward for us because in sweden we have, a bunch of like, I wouldn't say labor days but like we have, you know there's a bunch of days every all year where like we are not supposed to go to work what's the call like it's a late like a labor day vacation days bank holidays yeah whatever you want to call it it's it has like a different name in sweden and we also celebrate like it's like based on you know some type of like I would say religious but like some days are just like we celebrate this day everyone's off and in the rest of the world it's like what doesn't make any goddamn sense but I think, ikea day exactly I but I think this week is like a is a public public holiday is probably the word I'm looking for, and, and yeah this thursday is a it's a public holiday and coffee scene also feels like it's a weird thing to have like thursday off so everyone's off on friday as well so, so this is a short week for us so but so if we don't manage to solve the issue with our build stuff and manage to to push the build to ea today then maybe we won't do it wait actually I'm thinking maybe that actually didn't affect that at all I think that's a separate problem anyway we'll see, ea maybe this week but like there's nothing new on experimental that I think people are like looking forward to it so mainly bug fixes, the the major bug fix that we're trying to solve right now is the connectivity issue that some people are having where they can't connect to each other, we managed to solve a lot of cases when we updated the, some of the services in the game but now people are having a different problem and we still don't quite know exactly why that happens but that's that's one of the reasons why we've had experimental, and we're gonna switch over to to aa to seeing and if that solves a lot of issues for some other people or if that causes more issues we'll see, but an update to a is coming with some slight, issues to those problems and there's probably going to be a few performance fixes as well
