> there, someone asked about, where was this creative mode without having to mod yeah that's gonna come creative mode will come yes I don't know when but it will come I think we'll also talk do you I think impossible but it's coming you you guys will get it you guys will get it it's not that high right now prior to this a lot of people request it like totally get it but again like we have to balance what you guys want with the development of the game right so like we we have that responsibility to finish the game and to make the entire game as good as it can be and so while, creative mode will definitely add value in terms of people want a different mode it doesn't actually give us it or it may it might but it probably won't give us it's not going to push us forward in development, the game won't be closer to being finished, but but it might still be a good thing but but we will add it but it's also it's like it's also a big aspect for us where, we're kind of like seeing how people play the game and like tracking how people play like how balancing works right now and we we'd kind of like get like fiddle data if if we start adding creative mode where like you can build whatever and then we don't know like is the pacing good in the game or not like everybody keeps switching what if people just keep switching to creative mode because the field is too much of a churn and we're just like but we don't want it to be a churn we want the balance to be good your feedback yeah we need your feedback on that so if everybody keeps switching over to creative mode or like halfway more blah blah then it's going to be harder for us to do that balancing so I think like in terms of creative mode it's probably going to be something that we add when we we feel like okay now we think that the the balance is good enough so we can let people do whatever they want and we we can still get the feedback we need but we feel like we're in a good enough state so it doesn't really matter if we get dirty data or like messy data or whatever from people dirty data boy, someone's asking creative what question mark I'm assuming you don't know what, creative mode is and essentially it's just, free cheats you have everything, it's all free I get yeah that's pretty much
