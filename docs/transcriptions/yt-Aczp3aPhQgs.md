> can you continue after you finish the game I assume so I don't really know about the details of that I mean it would be kind of weird if you couldn't or or at least like you know load your save from before you finish the game so you can keep playing I'm not sure I don't know how that that would all play out but, so- I don't know what the team's plan is on that front but it's it's absolutely something they're going to think about so they'll make some decision one more than or another can you avoid finishing it yeah I don't think the game when- I don't think I think finishing the game will be like an intentional thing that you do that is an assumption I could be wrong that- I wouldn't I wouldn't want you to be able to accidentally finish the game I don't know that sounds kind of weird
