> for joining friends game steam from epic can we have a cleaner way than session ids, I can't remember if like when you when you link I can't remember which direction this goes but it's possible that you might only be able to do it via session ids yeah and there's not really a cleaner way to do it like I think from one direction to the other you can join via friends list but it's the reason is because, I think it's like steam doesn't really doesn't doesn't like, open up some some information that's required in order to do that yeah, steam is pretty closed off and like it's really hard to get any kind of cross play with steam because they're incredibly closed off exactly and, so it's it's kind of hard to do it exactly so we have to go with session ids to circumvent what's how how steam has things set up yeah epic has like a thing where you can authenticate be like hey I have an epic account can I get access to epic users and epic allow that but steam doesn't in the same situation so like if you so I think I think from steam you can like join by your epic friends list right or something like that yeah if you link it yeah exactly, but you can't but if you're an epic you can't see your steam friends that's the issue
