### Transcript

> so when you start the game you have like nothing you build the hub which is this building over here and that gives you like information on where to go next um and i guess i can just showcase a little bit quickly here um in the hub the way you progress in this game is you you kind of unlock uh milestones which is based like basically just like the game telling you i need these parts and then you send them up in the the freight ship that we have here and that unlocks buildings and materials and stuff that you can utilize to build more factories so you can automate even more stuff and progress even further than the game so currently i can like unlock this milestone right here which is jump pads which is a little nice little thing that you can use each gear has a bunch of milestones right yes so we're currently in the tier 2 face and we can unlock some jump pads so in order to do that we need some iron plates and we need some cables and some rotors i already have some rotors here so i'm going to put those in and we're gonna go and collect some from the floor below so i've prepped this a little bit so i got some containers with some goodies here
