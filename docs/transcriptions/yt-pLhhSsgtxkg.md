> i remember now why i brought it up, so last week we put our experimental right so a couple of people reported that they were having issues playing multiplayer on, for satisfactory and we thought at first it was due to the engine update that we did but turns out that i mean the sort of the yeah sort of the the things that we sort of concluded now is that their appearance apparently was an issue with the us like nat handling yeah the service that handles like connectivity for the game, for some people that have like more complex nat situations, there were services to like deal with that and those services seem to like been down for a little bit i think they're up now but if you're still having issues, then maybe wait it out a little bit, and hopefully that will get resolved and if not then reach out to us and we'll see what's going on yeah we got a bunch of like emails and stuff like that dms yeah but it seems that that portion because usually what's happened before is that like if eos goes down like it goes down for everyone and like people like even when you log into the game you'll immediately get like an error message and stuff like that but this time it was like a portion of that service that went down it seems it was so strange yeah so i was talking i was talking to someone who like their two friends could play together but he couldn't play with them yeah it's like really weird situations exactly and as we were like sort of troubleshooting with people we like more and more evidence creeped up that like this is probably the nat handling there's a bunch of like, techniques that those services use like rebate servers and stun servers and that punch through and stuff like that and if yeah and if you have like a more complex snap situation that can go out the window but hopefully that should be resolved by now we'll see hopefully satisfy satisfactory status pago yeah
