### Transcript

> so if you look at the power grid now you can see it's kind of like moving up and down a little bit that's because of the manifold system where like everything needs to be filled up before everything will run at the same time but our production is going up uh i mean it's gonna go up probably you could probably bring this back um i guess yes so what we're gonna do what we're gonna do now is gonna bring all the power back to base by placing uh power poles and uh for that we need concrete which is a bummer luckily there's a bunch of copper uh concrete over here not too far off so we're kind of in the good shape oh we kind of need to get up there though
