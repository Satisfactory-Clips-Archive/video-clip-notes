> a third person camera in photo mode would be a start yeah i agree yeah that would be different we we do intend on overhauling photo mode this is the same like this is what we sort of do a lot like we don't really like we see photo mode as like pretty bare bones and so instead of like incrementally improving it and hacking away at it to try and add extra things to it we might as well just like take a step back and just revisit it as a as an entire mode or option so, you know we're probably not going to be introducing little features to put photo mode over time it'll probably just be a big massive overhaul at some point yes i don't know when that will be and similar to the equipment thing so instead of like trying to add little things and make little tweaks to a system that maybe fundamentally isn't just the right approach we might just wait until we can think of a good approach or maybe we do have a good approach we just haven't scheduled it yet and then we'll we'll overhaul it yeah
