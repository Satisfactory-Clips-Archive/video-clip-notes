### Transcript

> so we're gonna showcase a little bit later now in the lake yeah so this is actually my factory and this is about 90 hours into the game yes, so down here this is where I sort of started and, all my iron production stuff is down here and, yeah but we weren't, I've got some cold generators in the background that you could see if you looked up but yeah so, over there on the right but yeah it's it's okay yeah we won't show that that's fine, and in this side we also unlocked the hover pack which is useful when you're building you can like hover around and like construct stuff and the hover pack requires a wireless connection to power so you need to be near power poles or train lines or things like that so yeah we actually have trains in the game we also have drones we're not going to be showcasing any drones but drones were added, in update four, our most recent major update but we have had trains for quite a while now and so we're going to go on a quick train ride right now yes one we're gonna go in a big chew yep a big old shoe yeah so this is a train and there's like different stops on the train you can see that there are if you take a look at the inputs and outputs just for a second you can see that like some things are coming in some things are going out so basically the train can can transport massive amounts of cargo each train station can
>

> you can set up what cargo freight stations unload or load what materials that you want so some of this material gets used elsewhere some other material comes in and gets put into the train so we can jump in the train and we'll go for just a really really quick tour because we're gonna go to the goal here is we're gonna go check out my modular frame factory so just made a modular frame factory he was automating them but we're going to go to my modular frame factory which makes a lot more I think snoop's little factory there made two module frames a minute right, silica had quartz yes my little factory correct, so yeah so schnitzel factory, makes, this little machine, maybe two multiple frames a minute but my factory makes 60. all right a lot more, but a lot of effort goes into that kind of factory so it's gonna this is gonna be interesting to showcase what it looks like to get a factory up and running and then what it can look like if you want to expand upon that and if you really want to push things to the limit a little how extreme or pedentic you can be when it comes to, to setting things up so this is my big train network it it carries a lot of resources around the ultimate goal to make a heavy modular frame factory
>
> [Music]
>
> this is my circuit board factory here circuit board and quartz crystals which should be making silica but they're making porch crystals, so yeah but they're making a lot of, circuit boards there choo choo only one two deep also these pipes you see moving here are called hyper tubes and you can like yeah that's for personal life transportation so it's kind of like futurama yeah yeah you can just like jump in they're powered and, you just fly around they're pretty nice so this here is the, smurfinator stop and this makes steel pipes here a lot of steel pipes this next train station is called long hard and the reason for that is because we make long hard things called encased industrial beams this is 75 per minute yeah yeah that's what it means you can see all the inputs that's coming from this one yeah a lot of a lot of conveyor belts feeding into that factory that was a really tough one to set up here's just a random miner that doesn't do anything yeah it doesn't really do anything don't worry about it people still use trains now that we have drones, yeah I mean I do because I don't have drones yet, so jase but just unlocked 37 I think so this is like the beginning of tier 7 yeah so we are going to my modular frame factory it's over here so it's a really really big train network actually that I have set up it goes over quite a bit of the map yeah you can see my map here and I haven't even explored everywhere in the map I played 90 hours and I haven't been everywhere on the map not even maybe about half of the map and a lot of that was just exploring for hard drives I don't know I don't even utilize that area of the map, not even remotely all of the resources so yeah the game is good bang for your buck that's for sure I mean I've got 90 hours on this save that's nothing people have played hundreds of hours thousands of hours so so this is my modular frames factory here so you can see it's a little bit more complicated this is your stop oh, this is, this is a little bit more complex so there's 12 assemblers doing five multiple frames each so this is an alternate recipe at the top you can see it says alternate, bolted frame at the top so this is an alternate recipe that I used after unlocking it with hard drives which is what you collect if you go exploring and I have this is a very complex factory I use some screws for it and in order to do that I have to bring in steel beams from another factory convert to screws on the fly because conveyor belts there's no conveyor belt big enough to handle the the bandwidth screws that I need so like this this factory posed a lot of problem problems but it works out really well a lot everything's balanced I used I used math the power of matthew guys yeah to balance everything correctly overclock things precisely exactly 107.6923 percent to get exactly 280 parts per minute from that machine so it was very very particularly, made factory I think this took me you know quite a few hours to set up but I'm really proud of it so another thing that you'll see is the big, things at the back there they're called refineries and they're sort of like a mid late game, mid-game building and refineries have a a water input and a and, and like a solid variable it's similar to the cold generator where like you have one fluid input and one yeah yeah so and they're they've got a lot of purposes they can be used for many different things and so I use an alternate recipe called if you open it up it's called pure iron ingot the reason I did it is because it for whatever the trade-offs are it produces the most iron ingots per minute so I wanted to just create a bunch of iron ingots and then and then and then make as many modular frames as I could out of those iron ingots so, I've got a bunch of iron ore veins coming in, and this also requires water as part of the recipe so you can see there's like I've got like a bunch of iron ore coming in I've got a couple, you can see the water extractors down there by the beach there's three of them providing water to the, to the refineries yeah and then from that point on using the exact same principles that snitch showed you know like starting from the end seeing this is how many module frames I can make per minute how many, of whatever yeah component do I need next and then I reinforced yeah I made like a notepad file and I crunched the numbers and I just set off from there a lot of people like to use excel but you don't you don't have to go to this extreme so dj rex are saying like I'm so confused you probably should be if you're looking at a factory that like I've spent four hours focused on you know what I mean and if you haven't seen this before then this would be confusing yeah I also felt confused when I was looking over here where like the the overclocking of down here like 90. what the hell how does this 28 constructors so if I offset them a little bit I save a little bit of power I get the perfect amount out yeah it's it's you but you don't have to go to this extreme but if that's what you like you can do that, and it's very satisfying when you do and again like what I'm saying before is if you're gonna nerd out you can just know how to to your limit you don't have to get 60 modular frames to feel satisfied you can just be like I want to make a factor that does 20 and you make that small factory perfectly efficient or something like that and that's your own little goal that you can create yourself because like you're not spending all these modular frames bro no no it's just sitting here but my goal here is that I never make another modular frame factory ever again that is true this is truly one to blow them out of the water
