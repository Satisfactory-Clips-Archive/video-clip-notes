### Transcript

> will there be an update 4.5 so i just want to clarify something we we we've no because there's never been uh those type of updates we the fluid update is the exception here with the fluid update was an extension of update four so i guess that accounts for it but it's very confusing when you talk about 4.5 and like the versioning uh like the semantic versioning that we're using because the a lot of people refer to the fluid updates at update 3.5 but that is the steam launch so it's really confusing so we try to not use those naming conventions for that reason mainly no there was not a 3.5 the the fluid update was semantically 3.6 but it doesn't have to anything to do it's it's irrelevant at this point um what they were called we we didn't call it that

> but anyway we're not going to do any more of those type of updates uh we're probably going to just call them update 5 update 6 etc etc if we do any any smaller updates and i believe update 5 is going to be like a smaller content update so the next update is update 5. let's see fluids were 3.75 so the i could i know that i go on way too much about this uh i care too much about semantic versioning semantic versioning doesn't use decimals uh that way i know a lot of people think they do um but yeah whatever i'm just no i'm just not gonna yeah nerd that's exactly why i'm not gonna go into this
