> has a satisfactory anime coming along oh man I'm I'm drawing it right now he's so cool I'm working on it as we speak into my other monitor in paint it's nearly done still really want to make nearly done something with like animated Jace Arts yeah because- I had an idea to make what was that, I had any of making like a commercial or something with Jason for something something oh yeah what was it I can't remember what it was well I'm down for everyone yeah I want to make something stupid because like everything else we make is so, so sophisticated and, yeah I miss I missed the, the really rough stuff that you know like back when you weren't really Community managing and I had to do like a lot of the headlifting like on my own like you would help out here and there but you know like it was all about well what can we squeak out that's still kind of fun and so like they were like the streams are like kind of weird and stuff like that but it was fun though it was really fun and- I kind of miss playing around without because when when like if we only ever do videos that are super super effortful then I miss the dumb stuff for sure yeah we should do like, because we have a tick tock Channel or like a tick tock, right it can't that we haven't done anything with like this could be a fun like little you know do something stupid small or something like that because there's always that like creative thing where you always want to like make something better but then when you do that you forget the, experiment like you stop experimenting yeah yeah exactly yeah but we need we need to do dumb all right, or were you about to say something okay nope I was not cool all right
