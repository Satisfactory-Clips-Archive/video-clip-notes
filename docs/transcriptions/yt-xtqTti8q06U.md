> how to repair our factories for update eight, if there's anything you need to do to prepare in terms of like if there's going to be any rebalancing or if there's going to be map changes we'll make sure to communicate that as soon as we possibly can or give you enough time so make sure you subscribe to our YouTube channel that's where that information goes out or hang out here on these, streams and then, and then we can let you know in terms of like other things to prepare for for like new content that's coming again you're just gonna have to wait and see, for what we announce but generally speaking we don't give too many specifics out since those specifics like balancing or like if there's new resources or something like that we don't really use specifics of like how those recipes work or whatever, beforehand so you kind of just have to figure it out when you get the build basically, that's generally how we've done it in the past the only time we you know we say a little bit more about that is if it's going to affect yourself yeah as it has done in the past I think with update three was the last big time there was a major, rebalance and a lot of, save files loaded but factories broke because the recipes didn't exist anymore yeah I think we take we take it quite seriously so that you guys will have like as much information as possible when we are making changes that will affect your current save files so you have plenty of time
