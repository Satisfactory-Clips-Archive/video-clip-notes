### Transcript

> those are all the new things about trains coming that's pretty much all the information but there is one more piece of information one more piece of information that'll be that we need to talk about two weeks ago jace did a boo boo I said remember two weeks ago and I said I play play play the play play the video, all of your save files essentially what this means is, they'll they should just work perfectly from update four into update five work perfectly work perfectly why did I say perfectly why save should work perfectly why did I say that why did I say that I'm sorry okay look I'm sorry I said the saves will work perfectly they they won't necessarily always maybe let's talk about that let's just talk about it okay but I am sorry, yeah you know like when I was thinking of that I was thinking of like but but fact you know like when we're like rebalancing stuff factories stop working and lines get clogged up but yes in this case with the trains for some people your save may not work completely it'll load but your trains won't be working because they're gonna derail okay for some people so for the people out there who just use like one train, you're not gonna be affected at all if you are using multiple trains on a loop then like with with just signals before and after your, train stations like that's like all you're gonna need to do to get your trains working again it's that's very simple as well but for the people out there who have like a single train line with multiple trains bi-directional traffic, you're gonna need to put in a little bit of work there, people with more complex train lines with complicated intersections you may need to put in a little bit of work as well we don't think it's going to be that much work and like your save file isn't broken it doesn't really break your saves everything's going to be fine and I think in most cases people will be able to find solutions to get their trains up and running again reasonably quickly so, yeah so your saves will still load you just need to tend to just just to your trains a little bit one other question that people have asked is
