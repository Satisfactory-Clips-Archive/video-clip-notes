### Transcript

> will there be a story mode, yes there's gonna be not so much a story mode but there's gonna be a story in the game, that won't the plan right now is that that won't be in the game it will launch with the game at 1.0, so everyone who you know when it releases and everyone who grabs the game or whatever they can start playing, probably from whatever, and enjoy the story if they want the story will not override the game it'll probably just add to it a little bit or just sit in the background so you can you can take part in it if you want or not so the game can be finished you will be able to end the game I think like factorio has an end game doesn't it yeah rocket yeah same kind of thing it's like a winning yeah a winning condition yeah
