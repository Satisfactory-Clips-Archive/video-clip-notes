> what day do the green screenshots have to be submitted for you to notice them, there's no like there's no date or anything like that I grab them kind of it depends like I kind of grab them last second to be honest as much as I can, but I do go back like if I if I if you upload something on tuesday and I grab screenshots before it's uploaded I'll see it the next week most often some especially if it's something that I really want to feature then I'll like I'll put a pin in it and remember another thing some people have like started sending me screenshots in discord that is that is no bueno like I am not gonna remember when it comes to dms and me like as soon as I leave as soon as I close down discord it's gone like it's it's I have I'm like a dog in the sense that, when people tell me something it just like goes in and out immediately, so when it comes to screenshots specifically I always like go I just do my rounds so to speak when I want to collect them and what I find I find you know so, people have been like sending me like from facebook and stuff and and sometimes I'll remember but there's no guarantee here the best the best ways is to use the reddit, hashtag sorry hashtag on twitter and their reddit, flair that's that's like the most the best way for me to see them, and sometimes I'll branch out, it's it's the reason why we're just doing those two is because of just like there's there's more than enough on those platforms alone so if I'm like maybe I'll do it in the future or maybe we'll do it in the future when we branch out more we do it sometimes sometimes I just go on discord and sometimes I just go on steam and stuff like that but, it's it's it's more convenient than anything because it do take a little bit of time collecting those screenshots and put them in the slides and stuff
