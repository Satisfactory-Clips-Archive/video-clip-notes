> most cases the other kind of signal we have in the game are path signals and pass signals are more complex kind of smarter signals and this is where the video gets confusing power signals are not really needed in the vast majority of the cases as i said before block signals take care of most cases but if you have like bi-directional traffic on a single line or if you have, complex in intersections or something like that you'll likely need or at least benefit from path signals so what do they do exactly what do pass signals do okay so path signals reserve a path through a block now okay that's what they do in essence but what does that actually mean if we take this complicated intersection segment you'll see that all the tracks are actually contained in one block so all these signals that you see are actually just all block signals and this big section in the middle is actually just one entire block therefore if any train enters this block no matter where it is in the block or where it's going it will stop all trains from entering the entire block because the block is technically occupied right so you can see this train entering from the side is slowing down to a stop it doesn't make a complete stop because you know the other train does exit the block quick enough but you can see that the train was slowing down for the stop and its block signal did not allow it to enter this block until the other train had left completely even though those two trains were never going to collide anyway can you sort of see the problem here path signals however will find a path through a block and reserve that specific path only this means that other paths within the block are still free to be used by other trains so long as their paths will not intersect with the reserved path and the ultimate outcome here is what you see that you can have multiple trains within the same block so long as they're using different paths so this example that i showed you know does work with block signals and pass signals it works better with path signals but you know it still works with block signals but there are situations as you build up your train network that you might find, only past signals can solve certain logistic, problems and you know as you as you build up you'll sort of start to learn these skills yourself and, and then you can experiment with it and you'll find solutions in that way so yeah if this is if this is confusing don't worry about
