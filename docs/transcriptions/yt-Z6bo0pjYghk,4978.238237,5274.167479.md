> so let's see if you can unlock all the the stuff in the ma'am, there should be a mem right there and, look at that the stuff yeah so so what is this new by the way in them where like it shows you like if you completely completed and like one thing that I didn't know about but apparently this is this is me just being like the fact that I didn't say it but when you haven't discovered these like chains it gives you like a hint of what it is yeah yeah there's like a description so you have the description there when you hover over it and it's different when you haven't started the research, so one thing we haven't shown is that all the loot that drops from from creatures now they have like their own separate type so if you hover over like the I don't think the scroll works I think you have to hold it or something like that maybe just drag and drop drag on the, which means you won't switch weapons oh my god this is yeah so so there's there's like a loot for the stinger type there's a loot for the hatcher, which you then create like alien protein from yeah and then you turn that into by so that was the final name the final name is, organic data capsule okay so the research is called bio organic properties gotcha and then from there you've got all these other resources and these are mostly the same so you got the inhaler here which we we changed our recipes for all inhalers a bit as well they're a bit easier to get and we vary them a little bit more so the protein inhaler which was before the inhaler that you made with spitter remains you can just use any alien part now because you use the protein and then you use some nuts as well and the reborn is still here as well but it has like a prerequisite unlock now which is new so that's why it's still locked here yeah and the reason why it's like half unlocked here is because we're playing on an old save file that was loaded before update six so like this is probably you're gonna probably get similar experience here yeah I think usually for most people it will look like this because these are new you usually already have these two because they they are the standard so there's like one hidden node there that's that's just a lock node though that doesn't actually show anything new right these are yeah I mean this one is locked so we have to get this one first, so which one is interesting it's like this one this one looks quite different yeah people remember it used to be just a line with like wrenches on the side a little bit more interesting christmas tree yeah a bit more, so yeah we did that moved things around a little bit just for visual purposes unlocks are mostly the same you have to stun rebar here which uses quick wire you got the bullet guidance system unlock which is the homing rifle ammo and the rest is basically still the same here yeah and then we get the mycelia tree with the so you got the the old polyester fabric recipe now here yeah we added an extra hand slot so you can have more equipment at the same time now oh is that new for updates yeah not an extra one so you can have six instead of what one inventory, we got the an extra inhaler recipe which combines the new protein with, the healthcare mushroom yeah someone is stop goofing y'all no you're nothing oh my god oh my god they're hitting you with the tractor out of here well good day I thought we had no vehicle yeah yeah and this one also just updated we updated the look for all of them a little bit just to make them a bit more interesting to look at you got the gas donald scare as well yeah that's my celia these are exactly the same as before that's why they're completely completed yeah or we didn't change the cost for some of them but that shouldn't be really you'll find that anyway, and then a couple more the shadowy bar quartz 3 which also has these little prompts now new shop products new shop products on the two basic quartz unlocks and we moved the blade runners here so if you already had unlocked the blade runners you should still have them that's completely fine yeah but if you start a new game you'll have to unlock it here and this one actually also used to be in the keterium tree so we moved a bunch stuff from there to here because the quartz was kind of sad yeah so we got the shadowy bar we got the the pulse nobelisk explosive resonance application oh the screen kind of works oh it does just work just very rusty okay maybe it's, you have to scroll like a lot for it to trigger yeah yeah you were saying the name, love this pulse novelisk probably got the most new yeah where yeah we got the experimental power generation which that's where you get the turbo view on the compacted call from and then we got the new smokeless powder recipe yeah so let's unlock that one I think they should be in somewhere oh never mind huge ass because they oh nice a lot of stuff just took it all it's mine do we have everything we also need plastic
