> want to single out a few things real quick that people have brought up so first thing is dedicated servers so we released dedicated servers and we said that they will be available for everyone whether you own the game or not available for everyone on steam and it should be in your steam library if you check the tools filter in your your library list at the top there there's a filter and it seems that not everyone is getting them there it's not appearing in in the steam library and, yeah just want to let you know that that is a that is a bug okay that's something that needs to be fixed up and we're we're currently chasing that down and trying to figure out what's going on there hey everyone future jace here just wanna jump in now there's just, been an update on the situation, still not really sure what's going on there, we're still working with valve to try to fix things up however they have made a change now so that people who do own satisfactory on steam should have the dedicated servers in their library now so check that now but of course we're still working with them to try to figure out what's wrong to make sure that it is available to everyone whether you own the game on steam or not but that's the current situation just, thought i'd throw this in real quick okay back to the video it is important to note here that i just want to mention again just to make very clear that these dedicated servers are they're out on steam only at the moment, just just because that's how it just worked out that's not really like our intention our intention is to have them on epic as well and also an image on docker hub and you know we're not there yet but that's what we're working towards so please hold up on that and just another thing to know is that even if you bought the game on epic you can still play on dedicated servers from steam that's no problem you don't need to buy the game again on steam in order to use that dedicated service had some people ask about that anyway hopefully that will get ironed out soon we're working pretty hard on that as well to make sure, dedicated servers are you know easy to access for everybody and also, there's a wiki dedicated server wiki i'll put a link in the description below that's a living document that's being updated by community as well so it's it's already much better than it was a couple days ago so do consider checking that out for all the most up-to-date information on dedicated servers but yeah there have been other bugs as well so like a lot of steam
