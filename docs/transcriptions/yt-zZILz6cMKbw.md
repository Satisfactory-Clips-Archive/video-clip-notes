> is it gonna be creative mode uh yeah at some point i believe so um we don't know when because i think creative mode will happen the thing the reason why we don't have creative mode yet is because there's still stuff that we're working out or balancing with the game we're still not like 100 happy with the balancing of the game so we're still like really collecting feedback from people and we think that adding a creative mode would like kind of disrupt that a bit

> and for us it's very important to get that feedback from from the vanilla players so that we can update the balancing for the game once we're happy with that though we're probably going to implement like creative mode right away uh because then we're probably happy with that and then people can do whatever they want and be creative and reach the bill limit much faster so yeah
