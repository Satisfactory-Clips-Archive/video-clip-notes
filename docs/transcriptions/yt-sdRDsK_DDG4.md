### Transcript

> when will artifacts be usable for something soon soon hopefully yeah we've we have been working on a lot of Story related things, please remember that you know the story in satisfactory won't be like a don't expect like a triple A Call of Duty kind of like cinematic experience because the story is still going to be sort of the the second the the not the primary part of the game the the primary part of size factories has always been like the sandbox you know building Factory building game and you're gonna be able to play the game without experience the story at all if you want to if you so choose to, so there's no like story block or something like that so but if you want to experience the story it's going to be a story and we've been working a little bit on like stuff that ties into the story and that's been going on since before update six actually so we've made a bunch of progress on that is it a bit it's a little bit like frustrating because like we've been doing so much work and we haven't been able to show that off because we kind of want to keep the story and all that stuff like kind of secret until the final release of the game for 1.0 so you won't really see too much of any of that stuff until the game releases essentially, yeah
