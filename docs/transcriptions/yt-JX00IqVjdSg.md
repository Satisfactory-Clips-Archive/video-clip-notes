> to one to six as well because you know like the fact of the matter is like it's really easy to [ __ ] on companies in general for like oh their their suits just wanna like just make money they don't give a [ __ ] about anything like yeah our suits i swear to [ __ ] god guys like i swear to god they care they actually care they they care so much they're gamers too they care so [ __ ] much and i mean like if they didn't just genuinely care which they do but if they didn't they would get so much [ __ ] from me like i am the kind of per i'm very unfiltered i will [ __ ] on anyone at coffee stain and if they're like we just want to do this [ __ ] just so we can get views or what like whatever like i was [ __ ] on them hard all right like like i'm i'm i'm serious like but i don't need to because the folks at coffee stain are gamers and game developers and they care about what happens with games so like publishers in my opinion get a really bad rap and maybe that's fair maybe that's rightly so but i can say in my opinion coffee stain publishers like genuinely care about what they're doing yeah if i if i were to publish a game i would definitely want to go to coffee stain publishing publishing yeah and i mean i mean that sounds like the most [ __ ] canned [ __ ] response in in the universe it is but it's but it's actually true it's so hard in our position to like be like we are always genuine like we've never lied or like try to like over exaggerate stuff just so like it sounds like oh look how well like things are doing like and [ __ ] watching people spin [ __ ] we say and like be like oh no like it's it's so weird this is also another thing it's so weird being on this side of, of, what's the like conspiracy theory thing where like you actually know what's true and you know it's [ __ ] when when people spin [ __ ] out of like proportion or like say thing like just make [ __ ] up like i see so many things where people say like, it's because of this and it just makes [ __ ] up it's so weird being on this side of it, because there's nothing you can do and apart from just trying to like say like but this is this is what it's like like, and yeah it sounds it sounds super like whatever suck up or whatever but it's true like yeah yeah right it is a weird thing where we we can say these these really kind words about coffee stain and like if we were paid to say this which we are that's what we would say but if we weren't paid to say this we would like we would say that we would still say the same things like yeah like like i'm i wouldn't work for coffee i wouldn't worry for coffee stain i wouldn't work for them i wouldn't work for them anymore if they were making me say nice things about them that weren't true that like i like really really i wouldn't do that because i like i would die inside i actually would coffee stain actually genuinely cares so much about the people that they're working with they act like it's [ __ ] stupid like i hate that publishers have created the name for themselves that they have and and coffee stain are are pushing against that like yeah like i i don't know i don't like and i don't blame the community for not believing us if we say hey this is great and it's not like i i don't blame community for that because like why would i blame them because they're only human and there's only so much [ __ ] you can take from publishers before you can start you know thinking what you think so but coffee snail cares they like like that like they act like they actually do i swear to god i [ __ ] wouldn't say this if i didn't mean it i i really wouldn't say this especially not on off time right that's that's how you know it's true oh god jason's getting drunk i swear i would say this sober i swear to [ __ ] god i would say like i would like i'm [ __ ] sober i'm saying it what the [ __ ] guys yeah it's true though i am confirming but it's also like the the how companies want to be companies like they want to look like this is a professional company make an efficient statement yeah it doesn't i don't know it's it's weird because it's like not working like it's why aren't people working away from this i've heard you say it's so british like i i mean i i yeah yeah maybe i should just shut the [ __ ] up because like i'm like i am drunk and i guess to many people that doesn't matter anymore what i say but i i've said this not drunk before like i like it actually i i am such an idealistic person that if this wasn't the reality i wouldn't be working obviously it'd be like it is be true why am i not drunk that's such a good [ __ ] question because you're saving me from being drunk i have to save at this moment no but seriously i'm all like you're on vacation but i also actually am taking a few days off yeah so i don't know
