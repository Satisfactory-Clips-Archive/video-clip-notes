> mark iii pipes that is definitely not happening in fact if anything we are gonna nerf pipes because they are they are issues that we cannot solve and I don't think we actually anticipated them working, fully, so we might we might nerf them but it won't be like, it won't affect you guys too much like it it will it will affect all the recipes so like it won't actually you know instead of yeah so slow them down so I think I think somebody figured out in chat I don't know if that's actually true or not but what will probably happen is pipes will go down 500 max 250 for the mark one and then all the subsequent recipes will be like will be reduced by that amount yeah so a percentage drop across the board essentially is my guess I don't know for sure because I'm not the one deciding this but I just know that the 600 on the pipes is like is is on the threshold of actually working and I think it's it's actually less work just doing that balance change than actually trying to fix the precision issues that we have with pipes and perf like on on lower spec pcs and stuff like that to make them fully 100 functional because there is like they work up until like five what what is it like there's like a there's a small percentage where they're off, and I think we can I think we can fix that like honestly I think there's a way to get first to get around that and like optimizing them so but but I think it's actually less work to just do that rebalance than actually trying to do that, and for you guys it will just be a different number it would actually like affect ratios as they are right now
