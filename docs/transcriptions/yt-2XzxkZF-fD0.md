> did you consider docker support for dedicated service yes docker support is is common, we we have we had to shift, like work load a little bit, so we were unable to work on dedicated servers, for a little bit but we are like as soon as we can sort of get those resources back if you will it always sounds shitty when you talk about people as resources but i mean that's how it is sometimes like not that the resources i mean that that's how you talk about it anyway once those people can work on dedicated service again then docker images is like the thing we're gonna be working towards so we haven't, skipped it we're just like we have delayed it in in regular fashion
