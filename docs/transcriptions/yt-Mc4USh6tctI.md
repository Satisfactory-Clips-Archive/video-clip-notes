> any ideas for items that need a physically bigger belt we already have items that don't fit on the belt and the way we solve it is that they just kind of like magically shrink you know they don't they're just smaller on the belt weird that's just, that's just how it is magic it's science but also magic mostly science yeah the fireworks fit perfectly on the build exactly let me put this chainsaw in my pocket real quick that's, what is the lore about that again it's like a pocket dimension that you're carrying around so you're like pulling it out of another dimension or something it's got some stuff from ant-man guess kind kinda honey I just shrunk the engines very nice is that a chainsaw in your pocket you're just happy to see me that is if if somebody comes up to you and they've got like in the in your in their like pants regardless you would run like even if that wasn't a chainsaw you would run okay just friendly advice from me okay if you hear something reven in someone's pants even if it isn't a chainsaw like run okay that is not safe but you do you chat like don't don't let the big man snit bring you down follow your heart but just saying run like the wind
