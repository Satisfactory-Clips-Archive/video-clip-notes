> uh folks asking about creative mode uh it's we we've looked into we're we're probably going to be adding alternate game modes to the game eventually but we don't want to do it anytime soon uh because we really we really want to finish off the base game right make sure that the core gameplay is a good experience and so sometimes people want to like sometimes like there's a good reason to have creative mode like that's just a good idea anyway for the game that's that's like one valid and fun way that people can enjoy the game but we also don't want people who experience some frustration with the game to then go to creative mode to solve that frustration we would prefer to hear the frustration you have so that we can make like alter the game and fix the game so that people who normally play won't have those issues and if we add alternate game modes in now we won't really be getting that feedback from y'all and we really need that so we really don't want to add alternate game modes like creative mode just yet but it is something that makes total sense for the game and um yeah maybe maybe we'll be a thing in the future yeah uh folks people who are just copy
