> The thing that I want to address here is
microtransactions [ding!] A lot of people were concerned that there were 
microtransactions [ding!] in the game Because they saw a shop. Rest assured there are no
microtransactions [ding!] in Satisfactory *clap clap* Most people figured it wasn't microtransactions [ding!] but a significant number of people thought it was microtransactions [ding!] in the shop You might be wondering why
we didn't say anything about it why we didn't say that it wasn't microtransactions [ding!] and it was quite simply because 1) it was kind of interesting to see, and 2) again it was a teaser and
we wanted to see people's reactions and let it simmer a little bit and then tell
you what is up I know some people might not like that because you're stressed
about it or you know what annoyed you or you were concerned but here
you are now you know no microtransactions [ding!]
all is good now the shop is one of many things, okay it's not the biggest feature and it is
certainly not the only feature in update #3
