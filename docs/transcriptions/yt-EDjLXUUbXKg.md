### Transcript

> will you add randomized worlds in the future i mean who knows what the future will bring but i don't think it's necessarily planned i mean because we're not going to be doing i don't know if we're going to be doing any procedural generation of the world we haven't even finished the world that we're working on so the thought of like doing any kind of procedural generated world is uh beyond the scope of what we're working on at the moment but of course there could be randomized uh like nodes and stuff like that that's probably possible but again like it's not really what we're focusing on right now
