> let's go okay hey everyone my name is jason i'm the community manager at coffee stain studios and today i'm going to be talking to you all about the feature teaser trailer last week where we released a feature teaser trailer that revealed the power storage and if you had a keen eye you would have seen a power switch as well so i'm going to talk about those two things plus some you know changes that are coming to power in update four as well okay so let's get into it i'll start with the power switch because it's easier to explain uh it's just a little switch or like a circuit breaker that you can use to segment off uh power to different parts of your factory so you can have one specific power section for your aluminium line or something like that and you can have that all come back to uh one power switch before going to your main power circuit for your factory um and then you can use that switch to turn that whole section on and off if you wish you could also name power switches as well just you know for organization's sake to make it easy for you to know what each power switch does and yeah that's pretty much all they do they kind of you know the the the old way of doing things uh would be to have just you know dismantled a cable uh from one part of your factory to another but now we have you know a dedicated little structure a little building to help you do that so you don't have to delete cables every time and then remember which ones you've missed or something so you've got these switches and they're super neat so the next thing i want to talk about is the power storage the power storage is essentially just like a battery it just stores power and then you can use that power later if you need it you might be wondering okay but but when would i use it why would i use the power storage so the first thing is the most obvious thing and that is you spent a bunch of time building you know a new section of your factory you hook up that new section to the rest of your factory and the dreaded sound plays uh big f in the chat yeah so so uh we've all been in that situation but what power surge can do is it can help you there it'll be able to jump in and help power your factory keep things going until um you can sort of fix up your power production to to then compensate for the fact that you no longer actually produce enough power there will be feedback like uh messages and like a sound effect as well there will be feedback telling you that you're running on power storage so that uh you've got a bit of a heads up so you can go and make any changes you need to to your power generation yeah so essentially just to uh smooth over those transitions when when adding more to your factory so another reason you'll want power storage and why this is significant is because there's actually going to be a change to the geothermal generators okay so previously you know they they're kind of boring that you put them down and then they just give you power there's not not really anything to them so we've actually we're actually making changes to geothermal in update four and uh what's gonna happen is they're they're now gonna be producing a like dynamic power it's it previously it was just 200 megawatts uh now it's going to be something like a range between 100 and 300 megawatts averaging out to be 200 megawatts but it's not going to be a steady kind of power source anymore and now power storage is something that you can take advantage of in order to smooth out the power generation of the geothermal generators if you wish you don't have to do that if you don't want to but you can use it to sort of bring back some stability when it comes to using geothermal generators so uh that's up to you to use that if you wish to use it we're pretty interested to see what people will do with that and uh yeah let me know what you think so the third reason you might want to use power storage is because in update four we're also removing the like self-regulation of power generators uh previously or as they are now in the version that you guys are playing power generators would only produce as much power as the factory would consume and no more than that however we're making it now so that they always produce their maximum output of power with the exception of the biomass burner they're going to produce the the maximum amount of power that they can and this means you then have excess power so you can use power storage in order to capture some of that excess power as well if you wish but you know you don't have to if you don't want to so you might be wondering why we're making this change and uh you know what i am too so i'm going to read the message i got from director mark chan so he can explain why so he says that it was a redundant feature on most generators and it didn't really add anything to a game with infinite resources it also couldn't cause some confusion and conflicted with the way fuel production now works after update three the polymer resin by-product production was unreliable and it also allows us to put control a bit more into the player's hands you know when using power storage for example so those are some of the reasons why we're making that change again let us know what you think about that it's always good to hear what you guys think okay so that's all i'm going to talk about today i hope you found that interesting actually one thing that i forgot to talk about i should have said this at the beginning of the video but you know i'm going to put it at the end and it's going to be a little surprise for those of you who stuck around to the end we we i don't think we've said it on youtube channel yet but we do have kind of release dates for update four we think we're going to get it out on march 9th or march 16th those are our guesses at this stage pending any unforeseen delays we're currently in uh like a feature lockdown uh so we're not making any new things anymore we're just polishing what we have and fixing bugs so hopefully we can get you update 4 within the month that would be super super exciting hope you're looking forward to that i hope you found the information in this video interesting and uh yeah we'll see you next week also you can always stop by on tuesdays for the developer streams on our twitch channel twitch.tv such carverstein studios devs take care everyone have a good weekend bye-bye power generators would only uh produce as much power as uh the factory would consume uh so we're we're the
