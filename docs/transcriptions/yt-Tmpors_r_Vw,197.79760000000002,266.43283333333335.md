> so the third reason you might want to use power storage is because in update four we're also removing the like self-regulation of power generators, previously or as they are now in the version that you guys are playing power generators would only produce as much power as the factory would consume and no more than that however we're making it now so that they always produce their maximum output of power with the exception of the biomass burner they're going to produce the the maximum amount of power that they can and this means you then have excess power so you can use power storage in order to capture some of that excess power as well if you wish but you know you don't have to if you don't want to so you might be wondering why we're making this change and, you know what i am too so i'm going to read the message i got from director mark chan so he can explain why so he says that it was a redundant feature on most generators and it didn't really add anything to a game with infinite resources it also couldn't cause some confusion and conflicted with the way fuel production now works after update three the polymer resin by-product production was unreliable and it also allows us to put control a bit more into the player's hands you know when using power storage for example so those are some of the reasons why we're making that change again let us know what you think about that it's always good to hear what you guys think okay so that's all i'm going to talk about today i hope you found that
