> did you implement a vision to see liquid within the pipes I don't think we will do probably not I'm not sure if there's like, an efficient way to do that especially when we already have the pipe indicators that work as they do yeah because the pipe indicators were kind of designed to get away from that, because yeah displaying the liquid in the pipes can be very you know imagine all the pipes that you have in the world and yeah I mean you know you would only have to maybe render it where the windows are if you have like little windows on the pipe right so like there's ways to make it cheaper but then it's like why do we spend any processing at all for it like do we want to spend any processing at all I think it would look cool I think it would be objectively cool in my opinion it would be objectively cooler objectively liquid yeah, but like everything comes at a cost right yeah
