> will fixmas and seasonal events in general be a regular thing maybe we don't really know it's super fun obviously like and everyone seems to be loving fixmas and that's great and it was really fun for the team to take some time away to just like focus on something really fun for a little while like if we have time we'll do it but it also really just kind of depends where we are in development at that specific moment in time as well so last year we didn't do anything christmas related and that wasn't because we didn't want to it was just like, with all the work that was happening with update three we did not have time to stop to to get a seasonal event out so it would be cool to do other things like eastern or maybe other you know and and other things as well we'll kind of have to just sort of play it by ear you know it'll happen if it happens i guess is is the short answer will we get science anytime soon
