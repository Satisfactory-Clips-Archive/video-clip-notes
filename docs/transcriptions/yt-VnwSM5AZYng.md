> um so someone someone before said uh when we were talking about the story they said uh you know they didn't want story um what do you think of that they did not want story they did not want story is there like is there okay can you think of reasons for why people wouldn't want a story what do you think about i mean i guess some people just want to just build a factory and not be interrupted for sure but then how does how does that affect them if they have story in the game uh yeah do you know what i mean like how would it negative negatively impact their factory building if they have story going on i don't want i don't want to i don't want to play story or anything like that and i've just heard that there's going to be story in the game uh is that yeah is that going to negatively impact my experience when story is not something that i'm interested in i don't think so no we the way that we designed the story or that we want to implement it is that it's gonna not interfere with your gameplay so all the triggers for story and all the things you do for story are are gonna be tied into the progression that we already have that won't change so story will never interfere with your gameplay and it will never tell you to go to this part of the map to collect this thing otherwise you can progress it will just be the natural progression of the game as we have now telling you to do that yeah and the story will just hook onto that same system so it will not interfere with your factory building and i guess you could just always mute ada and skip messages maybe we should add options to turn it off if you really hate it for some reason hell yeah
