> what's the greatest number of people you've had in a multiplayer session yeah what was the record I think it was like was it like 58 or something someone here in chat will know yes, one of our lovely communities organized an event the 128 event where they tried to get 128 players in one session which didn't work they did not get 128 but they got like 60 or 58 or something they got close to 64. but I don't remember if they actually yeah got up to that point, maybe people know here 58 of the same play model no different people it's 28 128 the max it's 128 is like sort of technically there is no real limit on how many people can join a session in the game but there's a limit to like the instructions on like how messages are handled when you're building things in the game so you can technically have more people running around in your world you can't have that many people building at the same time because I use a a is it unsigned or signed by I remember I don't remember if it was on cider sign or whatever but I set some limit that was 1.8 like identification numbers for the players so that is the technical limitation but no one's yet to prove it because I thought there's no way there's going to be 128 people in the same session no way and you were right called it
