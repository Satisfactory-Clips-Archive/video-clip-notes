### Transcript

> uh yeah and then we got this situation going on with the these are the new walkways you guys factory cart mark ii yeah mark two yeah far to your cart mark ii that doesn't have motion blur for some reason on the window i don't know what's going on with that this this shot was such a pain in the ass to set up by the way when i realized that the factory cart didn't like blur the window i was just like it oh that's frustrating i was so mad because it took like this shot took the longest by far to set up because of uh the way when we add stuff to the cinematic tool in unreal engine and uh and the factory card and animating it and then like lasting and just like capturing it and then motion cap like the motion blur doesn't work on the windows for some reason i'm going to try to do something in post but then like that sort of like we don't we don't touch up any of the videos in posts that we shoot like they're all straight from engines so like i'll be fine yeah yeah it always feels a bit weird when we like do additions like because even the motion blur here oh sorry the motion blur and like the depth of field here they're all in engine technically even though there's like not a good setting that you guys can use in the game to like get motion uh cinematic cameras for it yeah uh it's possible that we'll do something in the future for like the in-game photo mode that we'll be able to like set that yeah we do want to improve photo mode yeah so but but all this like is in engine so we're not like adding anything in post uh but yeah like look at the walkways look at that juicy stuff i am super down with the new walkways they look great yeah they they actually look super good i i can't really even remember the old ones that much anymore yeah um the old ones have like these issues like there are holes in like the both in the in the actual like where you walk the thing the walk walk part of the walkway yeah but also like the side bars like the the the railings there's gaps or something yeah there were gaps and stuff so sometimes you could have like issues where like you just like fall through the gaps and uh with these it's not they have a different collision uh box as far as i know so that shouldn't be an issue anymore um and they just look cleaner when you put them together um it looks good yeah and one more thing i want to mention too is that uh you might notice that the railings the new railings that were revealed the week before with the the announcement trail that was just railings like obviously there was more to it than that right it's not just like we're changing the railings yeah changing into the walkway so they're using the same uh i believe the the old railings will still exist in the game so if you if you miss those then they'll still be around yeah um so it's it's like more of an option yeah so then like a replacement
