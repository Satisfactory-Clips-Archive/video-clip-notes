### Transcript

> the trailers that are coming up the update itself is planned for 27th of october internally internally yeah which means I'm maybe november 15 yeah approximately yeah we don't we don't have, a date that's like we know what's gonna happen there but our internal date is looking promising according to our producer, so but I mean trust no one don't trust us on anything yeah but I think in the coming weeks yeah but I think in the coming weeks we're going to be like this is the date when it's coming out yeah yeah yeah I guess I wasn't supposed to say that my bad no it's not I mean you've already said it in the q a video but it's not today okay yeah so yeah yeah fired fired again whatever yeah yeah so exactly yeah so we'll see 27th of october hopefully, that's the thing where they said that they were pretty confident and I was like, so ea by end of the year yeah by end of the year hopefully it won't be longer than that but you never know it depends on what people what issues people find oh, good question so actually a bit of an update maybe we can talk about this too actually because there's there's more stuff than just the fluid update that's coming this year, because we also have we're gonna do an engine upgrade to the game which won't necessarily be noticeable by everyone but it's it's really good for us, upgrading the engine so the engine version we have right now is 422 and our goal is to upgrade it to 425 which is a pretty big leap in terms of, like upsetting engine wise so once the we're gonna like roll up the fluid update and I don't think that's gonna be in experimental for too long I think it's gonna be like comparably much quicker than the previous ones because I think we feel pretty confident about that because once that is out of the way we want to move over the fluid stuff to the early access and then we want to push the engine upgrade to experimental and that will probably stick on experiments a little bit longer because that's a bit more experimental and that's also happening in november or like that's happening in november at some point

> so so I don't think the fluid update will be too long on experimental but, famous last words I guess yeah I like how the, the morning folks are kind of like yeah we'll notice the engine change don't worry yeah yeah the modern people will probably notice it everything starts breaking yeah yeah yeah
