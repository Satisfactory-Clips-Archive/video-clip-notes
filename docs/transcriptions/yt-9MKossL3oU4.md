> oh yeah will the scanner be fixed so it doesn't show already picked items yo I almost fixed that bug when I was, programming, I was legit working on it and then I became community manager yeah no that was literally the last thing I was working on before I stopped programming completely, I was I was going to fix the the resource scanner where if you scan for like pale berries it and you pick it up it shouldn't keep beeping for the the same when you picked up because it's like it's looking for the bush it's not actually looking for the berries in in code, so I was gonna make a fix for that, and then I noticed a problem that is when they regrow you wanted to beep again, and I started looking into that and then no more programming but it will be fixed at some point it's like it's a card we have like a bunch of bug in our the way we track bugs we have like a bunch of cards and stuff like and like people are who are supposed to fix it and stuff like that so like once times freeze up like their list will become free, it's just not not a high prior bug that's been the issue right because like while we're developing new things and this is part of the the the issue of development processes like we we have like a list of things we want to work on right for each person and then we work on those things and then as we're developing new things for like the next updates then we're like all right let's let's implement an update to fluids and then we're like all right but that's more prio than fixing these bugs so then you get new tasks on top of those tasks and it just keeps going like that and some tasks have like some bug fixes have been like yeah it's maybe a minute or something to fix it but it just the their other prior things just keeps happening, so but that was one of the things cause- I was like my my time my time was running out as a programmer and I had like a bunch of free time so I was like I'm just gonna fix a bunch of small bugs, and I did fix a bunch of small bugs that a lot of people were happy about, I fixed like a bunch of the train bugs where like you can build trains as clients and stuff like that that was low prio for some reason, so I got that done but then I was going to do the the resource thing and I didn't do it
