### Transcript

> any news if Unreal Engine 5 will be implemented, I think the, possibility for that happening is growing more and more I'll say that much, and I know that if we switch down real Engine 5 the first thing people are going to say is like oh all these things like Lumen and now you're going to use it all right we don't know we have no idea okay like because all those things need to be sort of accounted for as you make the game and we haven't really accounted for that so we're not really sure to what extent we can take advantage of those things, if we can at all so and that's that's if we even go to Legend five but, yeah I there's there's there's a a decent effort being put into moving on religion five and we think that it will if we can do it it will hopefully help help the game quite a bit in 5.1 you can use nanite with foliage maybe if that's the case that sounds great because I know that foliage is, pretty rough when it comes to, overhead resources so if we can get any gains on foliage I think that would be pretty good
