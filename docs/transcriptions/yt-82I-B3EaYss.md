### Transcript

> if we get one color on the light options can we use freely just like the new and refreshing customizer tool so the they don't work the same way the lights are the lights don't work the same way as as the the walls and stuff like that so unfortunately it's it's not as possible, because we since epic added like I can't remember what it is specifically I think it's the batch batching for their shader pipeline but it made it possible for us to have an infinite amount of color instancing going on whereas with the lights they don't work the same way really or there's another limitation to the lights so having more colors unfortunately is more expensive for lights than it is for having it on everything else
