### Transcript

> size of the update i think the the size of the update is kind of it's kind of insignificant because you're gonna probably need to re-download the whole game uh due to the way uh the modular build thing works that we touched upon earlier so we're making like a we're we're we're doing a a change with how the game is like uh how the source sorry not the source the content files of the game is distributed by making uh the game modular in how it loads packages for the game instead of being one big package just like many and we're doing that so that modders have an easier time of uh modding the game and that means that the game files will add like a few gigs like one or two gigs but it also means that the patches maybe will be bigger but also maybe we'll be smaller depending on what we changed turn left wait wait wait i see you chad um chad plays satisfactory yeah yeah oh i would love to do that
