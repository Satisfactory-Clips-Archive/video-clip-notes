> i believe you have some cool stats alex about, the project as a whole oh yeah just, well like now we have this crazy number that we have 48 languages 48 languages yeah that nobody really translated into like that much that many languages and it's only possible because we have the community and it works like if the somebody comes to us and asks us to add a language we just we can just do it and for example we have cornish which is a, resurrected language with just not that many speakers but we have a guy who is an enthusiast who is just trying to create as much content in his language as he can and he's translating the game into cornish that's really cool so is that in in the game now it's not right i i'm really not sure if it's ready enough to be added to the game yeah yeah yeah so you wait till it's like a certain amounts done right yeah really for early access i think we're at languages when there's just 30 because now we have the percentage in the menu and people can actually see that it's really not ready to be played in but they might want to check it out to see if they like the translation or if they want to sort of join the project and help the person who's doing it that's why i met in it a bit early i think right right or at least i'd say we will wait until the language is ready a bit more like 60 or 70 probably okay, and how many how many like active translators do we have or how many translators do we have working in the community so yeah we have three thousand and three and a half thousand people on the project but most of them are inactive of course, we have 40 proofreaders so those are people who have the power to kind of lock down the translation and to select the best one and we have 105 people in credits so that means that we have 105 translators who kind of passed the threshold for being added to the credits it's a secret i won't tell how many how many words you have to just save and what have you to what do you have to do to get in there but i think that's a lot of people that's fine yeah that's really impressive and like over the past three months, and that includes the update for translation we had like 220 active members so those are the people who dived into translating the update form and i think it's really good it's a lot based on the fact that we have we have 48 languages but not all of them are really active some of them are just like not moving really fast and so yeah 220 active members is good i think really good that's really cool it's it's so great to see that we can have like so many languages as well like i don't think there's that many games that have you know over 20 yeah over 30 languages in the game right so that's that's crazy aaa studios don't do this because that's not feasible really yeah yeah no it's nice
