### Transcript

> to walls call rendering in other words am i supposed to build factories as well some machinery and belts don't render they don't it doesn't really matter that much with the walls we've explained this, the reason for this like a few times before in the past but, essentially a lot of the buildings that we do because people build the same things over and over we use instancing systems that help speed up rendering basically and the way that instancing systems work is that if you if you were to block things with walls so you can't see them anymore going through the system to pull those things out and not render them doesn't save like any any time actually so it doesn't really make a difference so we just keep rendering them so no essentially the short the the short answer is building walls probably won't really, impact the performance of the game if anything you're building walls we have to build we have to we have to handle the walls now
