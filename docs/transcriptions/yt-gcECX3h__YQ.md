### Transcript

> the obligatory question of whether or not we can have more than one player in a vehicle because the explorer has multiple seats so we could back in the day before the game came out and then someone decided that we shouldn't have that capabilities and then disabled it and then now we are of the belief that we don't want to do that anymore but if you ask anyone why no one knows so that's the status that's a really good summary of that actually yeah that's that's literally it it's like there was someone who told me like, yeah that's right there was someone who's told me this story of like this person who would like when he's gonna cut his stakes he would always cut the tips of the steaks off and then cook it it's just like a weird thing and someone someone asked him like why do you do that why do you cut the tips off he's like I don't know like my mom always did it like oh okay so go to the mom and be like yo why do you always cut the tips of the steak she's like oh I don't really know my mom used to do it but okay so was it like the grandma I was like why I cut the tips off the steak so like because they didn't fit in the pan so they had to shred it so it's like I feel like this is the same case with the vehicles where it's like we've just inherited this belief we should just- I don't know I this you know what that might not be true mark might have good reasons but whatever we sort of figured out a lot of people are kind of just like I don't know it's I don't know and but no one wants to do it either but no one really knows why that's the thing right I don't know if we know whether or not it's like like a design decision or it was a technical decision or do we even know that I don't know because that is a really good like, parable as to the situation because like you can no you can't ride in trains together but you can't can you can you have like if you have two trains on on like two locomotives on one train section can you have two people sit in each like train car oh yeah what happens there because like if it's a technical reason like why I mean it works in the train doesn't it kind of or maybe it's not because it's the same thing I don't know yeah I mean I don't know if it's a technical reason because we used to have it yeah I mean I mean but I mean but there could have still been a technical reason to not have it still like just because it technically worked back and it doesn't mean it works reliably for all reasons always but but you mean at this point it is a thing I don't know like we just have to right that's the answer we just someone's grandma knows the reason why that's what we your grandma we need to find out why there's only there's only one grandma on the planet he'll know the reason you could ask her quick before time runs out, I saw a question before that I wanted to answer but it's gone now so I guess we want to do that, sounds technical to me yeah for sure
