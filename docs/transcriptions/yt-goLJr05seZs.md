> adjustable scanner so when you scan it shows resource nodes that don't have a minor on them does it not do that no so like it doesn't like it shows you like if you have a cluster of nodes it will like if there is like if you placed a minor like not a portable mine or a miner then it will be occupied and it will not show up in the scan that's what I'm saying yeah, but I assume they mean the other way around they want it to show up on scan no it says, so when you scan it shows resource nodes that don't have a minor on them yeah because you need that because you need to place a minor yeah they need to but you need to place a minor on every node in that cluster otherwise every node yeah because otherwise it will like it will move the ping to the next like available, node yeah cause we like combine them into one, ping yeah yeah yeah no no, yeah- I thought that it was like if you just had one of the cluster then it didn't pick it up anymore
