> iron ore can only become iron ingots in
> it's not really useful for anything else
> would be really nice if we can automate
> that stuff as well so let's see what we
> have available to us in the production
> tab we have a basic smelter what does
> that do well smelts or into ingots and
> goods can be further persistent to do
> things that sounds really good so let's
> build a basic smelter so shift
> left-click we have the little choked up
> for it now on top left we want one of
> those eight iron plates paint iron rods
> and four cements alright well this guy's
> taking a lot oh we can see that this is
> full now it can't actually mind any more
> so let's take that out so we can keep
> mining
> what a beta construction has been in
> luck that means our ship has been sent
> so we can go back to our trading post
> now let's pick a new thing let's uh
> let's research can very splitters
> mergers and containers that sounds
> really good okay
> so that requires 25 iron rods 225 iron
> plates I'll take care of that in a bit
> let's let's carry on with the smelter
> alrighty we have the iron plates and
> rods that we need but we need cement
> what does cement require it requires
> stone okay I know that there's stone
> right there so I'm gonna go dig some of
> that up make some cement as well okay
> now that we have the cements I'm going
> to build a smelter in front of a miner
> and you can see on the hologram that
> there's like an input and output the
> green box on the left with an arrow
> pointing in is input orange with the
> arrow pointing out is output I'm gonna
> face the input towards the miner like so
> right click to get out of the menu and
> then I'm going to build a conveyor belt
> which we just researched but they
> require our in plate so I'm gonna make
> some iron plates first so we have iron
> plates now so I'm going to build a
> conveyor belt I'm gonna you can see it
> snaps to the output of the miner so
> click on that and we can build it
> wherever we want but let's build it
> directly to the input here maybe yeah
