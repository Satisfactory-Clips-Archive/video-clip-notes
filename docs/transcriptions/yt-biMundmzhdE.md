> yeah it's, dave today dave is just you know same as always same as always yeah, but you know I mean [ __ ] devs hello vilsol, but there is you know what we can say is that we are actually we have like a little bit more of a plan of how we want to sort of do things and that like in the next couple weeks we plan on, yeah unveiling like what what we plan on doing, and and and, you know getting you guys into the loop, we're at the point where we can pretty much do that pretty soon so, keep keep your eyes open and your ears peeled eyes peeled ears open I don't know, over the next couple weeks and, I think we're gonna be dropping a lot of information at that time if everything keeps going according to the plans that we have now and, yeah so you know thank you very much for waiting patiently much appreciated while we take the time to figure out what we need to do as the project does sort of transition into a different sort of area that it that it has been over the past few years, so we're sort of working that out, thanks for the patience and, look forward to telling you what's happening because I know I know it sucks when you don't get any updates at all that's, frustrating but everyone's been really patient anyway and so I really appreciate that I think we we all appreciate that so it's open for two weeks that's hard true true moisturize your eyeballs oh yeah yeah you gotta blink don't forget to blink, sorry I saw a couple of comments about final fantasy in the in the chat while you were talking about that, so yeah we I mean development has been going on behind the scenes you know like it's not like we've stopped working on the game and then now we're back at it like we've been work we've been working hard day and night not so much night mostly day but, there's been stuff going on in the background there's been a lot of different stuff going on in the background so we haven't been sure like what what we're gonna like concentrate when it comes to releasing the next iteration of the game if you will yeah so yeah everyone's been busy so even though we haven't been able to commit to plans publicly with y'all doesn't mean we haven't been progressing on the project it's just kind of yeah it's been, yeah so yeah hopefully in the next couple of weeks, we'll have some actual news not just consider this the countdown to the countdown or whatever exactly we're announcing the countdown to the announcement of the countdown yeah exactly but you know soon soon we'll have some stuff out there and I think it's going to be it's going to be interesting can't wait to see what y'all think about what we're doing yes so some folks are commenting on my 20 fps if you guys could look this way at this setup I mean there's a box there's like a high heat pad there's a printer power bank ring lights there's like it's just why don't you take a picture with your phone and show everyone what it looks like oh hold up that's what I'm using as my camera because nothing else is working okay so you know this and a whole thing is just duct tape holding everything together be glad there's anything at all I don't know maybe it would have just been better without my you know what look this is what we're rolling with, and we're going with it whether you like it or not okay yeah like I said before this is correspondence jace reporting live from aussie town exactly exactly we had to flip the camera and everything so I wouldn't be upside down it's kind of wild j-squad was better look you know what that's I can't I can't outperform j-spot I agree jace the bush pilot exactly I mean lucky that I haven't had my limbs torn off by giant spiders yet we take our winds sounds harsh dude must be hard, sorry it's just doing one thing in the background so so yes that's that's sort of the state of dev is that soon soon tm but there's a couple of other interesting things, we'd like to talk about here as well today, first we just want to rip off the bandwidth here real quick and talk about last week's video or not video actually last week's, podcast podcast yeah so well first of all what did you guys think of that have you yeah you know if you've seen it let us know have you seen the vodka podcast final fantasy and so I combined them into podcast very good did you guys enjoy the podcast let us know super informative in all caps okay that's nice my favorite comments from it so you know it was a it was an april fool's joke if you didn't see it but my favorite comments was like from people who are like it took me 30 minutes to realize something I feel bad for those people a little bit they seem to enjoy I mean they hung around I guess they said they hung out for that long yeah I guess they enjoyed it that's that's that's the nicest, comments are the ones where people are saying like like this was entertaining and and this wasn't what I came for but it was still fun to listen to like yeah you know that's fair because it was really fun it was a lot of fun recording it I'll tell you that much like that was probably one of the most fun recording sessions we've ever had yeah I woke up 7am to record that yeah oh yeah I've shared the link to the podcast in chat now if you guys haven't seen it yet I think it's entertaining regardless of what it is you know, but but to burst everyone's bubble a little bit we are not actually planning to have an actual like satisfactory podcast even though we tease at this being episode zero zero one which says that like the joke there implies there's gonna be hundreds yeah when arguably we didn't even achieve one no, everyone called it the final fantasy podcast, yeah yeah, was the podcast completely scripted no well the satisfactory parts were scripted a little bit yeah but the final fantasy parts was genuine yeah oh yeah that was there was no script for the final fantasy part apart from the segway everything that came after that was pure from heart and I love jason's initial comment about like this in this podcast we're gonna see where the discussion take our hearts take us to final fantasy so for those of you who I think most people here on the stream will know the reference the fact that we constantly talk about fan fancy on the stream and we should be talking about satisfactory we thought we'd do that and just like take it an extra step essentially, so so yeah today I learned it was an april fool's joke nice yeah but but- I also like this I like how a lot of comments my favorite comments in general on that video are like people that argue about final fantasy they like go off the fact that this was a satisfactory related thing and like actually discuss final fantasy even when people are like genuinely like upset about final fantasy takes we made like those are I love reading those yeah because they were engaged with what we were passionate about and talking about in the moment you know what I mean yeah that was pretty cool, yeah it was it was really cool so like like after we recorded it snoop and I were both like there are so many more things that we could have talked about like we were done we didn't even have our fill we just had to wrap it up because time was up yeah you know, and I had someone else saying like how many times did you break down laughing like not really at all no like this is just it was snoot and I just talked about final fantasy yeah there were a couple of, like like giggles at the end that I cut off that I cut away or removed from the final edit, but not that much no we kind of kept faced the entire thing, it was mostly at the end we were going like all right get a wrapper yeah but anyways so so, yeah if you enjoyed that I'm also surprised to see how many downloads we got on on the actual podcast like it's on spotify by the way for some reason, didn't actually think we were going to get up there but we got it, cool so yeah anyway so that's that's us
