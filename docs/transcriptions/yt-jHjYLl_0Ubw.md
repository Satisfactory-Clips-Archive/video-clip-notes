> anyway hello everyone welcome to the stream we needed ideas for content and carl came through with the with the assist very nice saved, should we pretend we don't hear him shut the [ __ ] up anyway yeah it's good well hello everyone that was a very big brain 500 iq gag there gag that's for sure that was a gag all right yep 100 it was a gag all right, what are we doing next state of dev my man it's the, the best part of the stream take it away yeah you know what I mean, I actually don't know what we're working on because I've been, away a few couple days but we are working on like if you haven't noticed holy [ __ ] we've been pushing like almost daily, updates on the experimental branch try to fix the issues that we've been causing y'all with, issues yeah so the rundown is, we're essentially doing experimental stuff for real now, because we have a bunch of fixes that we we're like this is like we're right now we have a fix on experimental that's like for the conveyor belts it has to do with the precision and the yeah the accuracy of the belt and multiplayer essentially so we kind of reworked them totally, how they work in network, and, every time we re-write systems it's prone for issues, so we knew kind of when we pushed that patch that would it was gonna be experimental, the experimental branch was to live up to its name and yeah it was it was like 100 crash rate on client, like the couple of days I think it's way better now I think the patch we push pushed yesterday resolved like maybe 80 of all the crashes that people are having in multiplayer and we have another, fix today I think that patch is just going to be another tweaking on that system that will hopefully resolve all the issues but yeah if if anything else, please go to our q if you're running into issues on experimental please go to the keyway site and submit your issues there right now we really want your feedback on like stability for multiplayer on specifically conveyables, and we also chucked in a few like surprise fixes, we we optimized a bunch of how like trains work in the game apparently trains were super super expensive, when they were far away, they weren't optimized at all like they ran just as they would if you're like using the trains which isn't like that's the thing with satisfactory if everything ran like all the time it wouldn't work like at all so there's so many like we remove stuff and optimize away things when they're far away and stuff like that and trains didn't have that optimization and holy [ __ ] that made a big difference for some people some with a bigger, say false so we did that and we have there's still more optimization on the train cards apparently they are also super expensive for some reason so there's still more juicy optimization things coming, probably this week and I think that's state of dev we're still working on like fixing those kind of stuff like those kind of things, and we're probably gonna do that probably another week, and then after that maybe we'll jump into the engine upgrade if we can resolve all the issues that we're having right now, that we're merging bam speaking of which we will hopefully be getting maybe a video out this week or it might be next week, with some information about the engine upgrade so I'm gathering information now and, hopefully you guys can learn more about that in a youtube video coming up this week with any luck make sure to smash like if you like information smash like smash comment and smash subscribe hell yeah smash subscribe
