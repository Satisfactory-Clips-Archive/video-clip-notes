> time uh actually something that uh i mean we've talked about this for you know a lot mark but um it's still a good idea i think to go over because some people haven't heard and we have a lot of people watching today as well um and that is come on dude did i just actually forget

> oh no i remember i remember okay okay so it um it's like blueprints or uh mass construction um yeah uh we we haven't got that will we have it uh if not why not uh i mean that one is a tricky one so i think this one it might be one of the oldest ones i think that's been going around internally as well that discussion i mean that's that that got in really early when players started playing that they were like i want blueprints masters mass building and all that stuff dragon dropping for my foundations uh i mean of course there's technical issues with that i think the blueprints are very difficult to do i'm not 100 sure you guys probably know more about that than i do yes i don't the technical difficulties yeah it's the connections that are detecting like the issue like because it's not hard to do like a composition of buildings but hooking them up is the difficult part making that work properly okay yeah yeah i understood yeah the technical issues and then i was talking with safon recently about this and the problem is that the bigger your factory is the the more messed up your frame rate will become and that is just a given uh and this game i mean a lot of people are building massive factories and that is really cool to see but at some point you will reach that moment where everything just starts breaking your entire computer lights on fire and if we add tools to make it easier to build bigger faster more and more as you progress then we might kind of be driving ourselves into this corner where more people will start building bigger factories and they will build bigger factories than they're now even building and then the game doesn't really become playable anymore at a certain point that is an issue that we've been discussing but i mean we have to see if it's a relevant problem because you're still kind of it's still up to the player themselves how big they want to build and there is a certain cap until i mean you can build really big until you really start seeing problems like we've been playing testing a lot of recent weeks and we built a massive factory and we had no issues with frame rate so it's something to consider like we're still looking into it but i think we should have them personally because another thing is another thing is also like the aspect of like because you can't mass building like minecraft and games like that and it's also like the fun in that game is also the fact that you aren't like you're building on a macro level yeah yeah um which makes everything is from your perspective you're not like it's not a you know sim city type game or like it's easy to get an overhead of everything and yeah and it's like for the people that enjoy that type of game and for the people that want maybe more want a different direction like there's also that balancing of like if we change such a big element in satisfactory if people that really like bought the game or joined the game just because of that first person like small scale like or those people kind of become alienated yeah something like that i don't know yeah that's always an option i don't know i think i mean even if we would add it we would still balance it to not be completely out of the scope of what this game should be uh and there are also ways around the performance issues um my personal opinion is that i mean a lot of people seem to want it and that might be enough reason to add it if we can yeah it's it's a it's a difficult one i think do you off do you feel like when you're making decisions for the game do you feel like there are often times where you're like i personally want to do it this way but it's probably not what's best for the game or or is it just like just do whatever the [ __ ] i want no i am perfect what's best for the game no um i know i i try to do what is best for the game and that's usually where where my the direction that my opinion comes from and that's what i want to do so generally they kind of overlap but of course sometimes i'm wrong sometimes i really think that this is the thing that is best for the game and then it turns out that it wasn't uh and that happens all the time then you just need to change it this is really tricky because like a lot of people have like even in coffee scene we all have very different opinions of what like what direction to take satisfactory or like what to make of it and that's like that's the big benefit of having a game director is that you have someone who can kind of guide it in the direction that hopefully encompasses everyone's opinions and like or what's best for you know both what we want to do internally and what what community wants and stuff like that um it's also a nice thing that way because we that way you just get a lot of discussion you get a lot of different viewpoints in there uh and we have i mean the nice thing is the game is already out so we have this vision of what the game is because people are already playing it and there is already a product now we just kind of need to see what we as a team want i think and what the community wants but i like i like it kind of when when people have different opinions and we go into those discussions because it tends to end up that we all agree in the end anyway and then you got more hopefully the best thing that we could have made at that point and then we just throw it to the players and they hopefully will spot some flaws with it as well and then we can fix those as well okay
