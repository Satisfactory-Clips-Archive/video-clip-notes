> and then use about fixed for multiplayer issues where some players kind of join needs to be killed in order to actually respond so i have addressed this a couple of times in the stream but i'll do it again we are aware of that issue that's something that we're prioritizing looking into, we pushed a fix for that for some situations last week, where people were having connectivity issues and we managed to solve some of them but not all of them and we're still looking into that particular one specifically where it works after you kill like players in the world and stuff like that it's really odd, we're trying to figure it out, but, yeah so that's that's pretty much what's going on experimental right now maybe maybe i didn't talk about that, i haven't talked about that at all but we have experimental running again since a few weeks back and the reason for that is because of that connectivity issues that we're trying to, solve that specifically so if you're not having connectivity issues there's no real reason to switch to experimental right now
