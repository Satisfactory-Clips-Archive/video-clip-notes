> the scanner and the explorer, users using scanner okay so yeah using the scanner inside the vehicle have we have you consider that, no no I mean the resource scanner I always thought that would be nice but I think there is like an issue with that with the way our equipment system works yeah I think we can just do it, it would be nice I think it's probably more trouble than it's worth we kind of need to because we have that issue with, gas masks not working in vehicles and that is inherently in the way we handle equipments, do you know if we were actually fixing that for this update I'm not 100 sure we talked about it I don't think it's gonna be making the the pre-summer push okay it might come later down the line yeah because that's kind of probably good to understand as well as that that is kind of the case for a bunch of stuff we're working and looking at now with with this theme in mind as well but it's also moving towards 1.0 is that there is more coming down the line because we want to just get things out for summer partially because we're we're going to go on summer vacation and if we do it after summer suddenly we're way later in the year yeah and it's it's more important for us to just get things out there and get players to experience them and give us feedback on what they what they need and what we need to improve yes it's that finicky vacation time always just thwarting our plans it actually is it's, it has with the time yeah it has been like a little bit where our updates have come in such a way where we kind of offset the the delivery of them all the time so like you know you used to be that we tried to aim for like february when released and then it turned into march then it turned to april and like now we're past may and like it always like turns into like oh we can't we can't make it, and now we're totally in the stew, but but then it makes sense that we're actually doing it this way so we we don't release like a major update this time so we can't release it before summer and, yeah we'll see what happens with that
