> do you ever look at the mods and think there are features you'd like to include in the full game uh not really most of the things that uh have been like modded we've already had like either planned for or have been in our backlog or something like that there are a couple things that have come up that are you know that we hadn't thought of that we now uh think of whether we'll do it or not don't know i think i think something that's really interesting is seeing the implementation of specific features you know so sometimes we may have a feature in mind but we don't visualize uh how it's supposed to be and how it's supposed to function and we get to see examples of that via mods and so that's pretty cool as well also there's something actually kind of strange that happens alright so like word on the street is is that whenever we start talking about a new feature that we want internally you know around the launch table the modders then release that feature like two days later so uh i'm putting my tinfoil beanie on and uh and uh i don't know what's going on there no kind of sucks vote lime green all
