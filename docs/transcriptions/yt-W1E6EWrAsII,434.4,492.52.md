> Is there a height limit in the game? How will verticality affect the game? There is no height limit .. or there kind of is; It's the skybox and Is Uzu, our QA tester has actually hit the skybox before when messing around but we may enforce that in the future because you know, it could break the game will cause performance issues, but I don't know like maybe that's fun Maybe we should just leave it as it is. What do you think? Maybe tell us what you think in the comments below as for how verticality affects the game it is actually crucial to Satisfactory, it's our biggest advantage for being in 3d. Right? What it does is it allows players to build bigger factories in a smaller surface area And so if 35 square kilometres sounds a little small to you ... Which some people have said Please take verticality into account If that's still a problem we can make the map 35 by 35 kilometers. I really hope people get that reference and don't actually expect that...! Was the reveal trailer a cinematic or was it shot in engine?
