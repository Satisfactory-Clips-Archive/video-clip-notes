### Transcript

> Wow, what a day! That's a lot of stuff coming 
to Update 5, Snutt. Sure is, Jace. But this video only covers
some of the features in Update 5, there's still a ton of quality of life
features, optimization, and bug fixes coming to the game,
so make sure to check out the patch notes in the description below
to learn more about that stuff. That's right.
And if you check the cards above, there'll be a separate video
for the state of dedicated servers, how to get them and how to use them.
So definitely give that a look too. Hope you'll all enjoy Update 5. It's a bummer
that we weren't able to add any golf yet.
