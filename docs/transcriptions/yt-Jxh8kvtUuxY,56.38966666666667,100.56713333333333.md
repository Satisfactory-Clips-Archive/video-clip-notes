> kinds of resource welds uh nitrogen gas of course uh but also water and oil and the extraction method for these will require two new buildings uh resource well extractor and resource well pressurizer the way this works is you get the resource well pressurizer you place that on a well it's going to pressurize the well and then at various locations in the area the resource is going to start spewing out of the ground hit the mic a little bit got a little carried away resources are going to spew out from the from the ground you grab your resource well extractors you put them on those locations and you start uh piping whatever you have back to wherever you need it to be and because you can buy from all these different locations at the same time there's a it's a lot higher resource output rate actually via the wells than the traditional methods that's you
