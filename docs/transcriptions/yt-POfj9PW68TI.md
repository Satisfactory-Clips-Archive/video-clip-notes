> fail teaser I know right, that's sort of you guys don't really see it but like a lot of stuff when we showcase things for you guys like especially, like when we're still working on things you know like when we were making the the reveal trailer for update 4 for instance like a lot of things were done so it's easy to make like it's like a trailer showcase like look at this cool feature when we're in the middle of development of things sometimes they don't fully work and then we have to sort of like get it to a good enough state that we can show it off and then move on and like there may be like a few tweaks here and there, like if we showcase a teaser video for instance one a good example of that is the, nuclear pasta for instance that model wasn't done or like the vfx for that model wasn't done when we were making the patch notes video so we had to put out like a version of that that was kind of work in progress and you know people won't really know until you know the actual video is released sorry the actual game is released so you know sometimes there's a bit of wonky nest going on and you know there might be a few cases where we show off like here look at this cool, thing the railings maybe the model will change a little bit I don't think it will in this case but you know that can always happen when when we're teasing stuff as we're developing it, so yeah what was the question again I already forgot just [ __ ] ramble on
