> I love that you guys engage with us and explain why you guys are making decision making I'm glad that you appreciate that, I think it I think it's important like personally that like sometimes if we don't even have an answer but we just tell you the situation or just tell you what we do know or whatever, or even if we even if I were to say like yeah we do know but we can't tell you like that's a bit like blue balling but like at the same time it's also just the reality of things right that's like how development is if I if I wasn't gonna do that then I could just like come up with some like canned lie you know like whatever that to just get used to stop asking questions but I'd prefer to just come straight out and say we don't know or we do and can't tell you or yeah I think it's nice because, there's so much like misunderstandings between game developers and people to play games of like how games are made and like what the what it's like so it's nice to try and shed some light on that stuff
