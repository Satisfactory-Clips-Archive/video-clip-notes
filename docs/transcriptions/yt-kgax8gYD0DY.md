### Transcript

> hover pack too late this is also probably not going to happen, mark moved down to tier vii and mark wanted to have it earlier than tier vii but it's like you know game design can be a little bit of a house of cards sometimes where you start moving things around and you realize like ah but if I move this over here then this thing won't fit and then if you move that then that won't work so I think mark realized because when I left when I talked to him last time he was like yeah it's probably gonna be in like tier five or to six or something like that I think it makes sense and then after he like started looking into it he realized that it didn't work I don't know what he found what he found in the in the caves, but he realized probably that didn't work so that's probably not gonna happen unfortunately, same thing I might say that it's probably not gonna happen that's based on today's information we're still in early access we're still developing the game anything can happen, for instance when it comes to blueprints we've been going back and forth about this a lot last time I talked to mark he was pro blueprint in a in a certain way in a confined space something like that so but we still haven't decided I think, so take it with a grain of salt when I say that probably not gonna happen famous last words pipes were never gonna add to the game and look at that the only except the only the only exception is tower defense that's something that's never gonna happen period add another reference to the website
