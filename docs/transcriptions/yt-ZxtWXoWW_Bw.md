> ever consider doing point five updates something that builds on existing features for example new old recipes so, we have done that in the past, yeah yeah we have sort of done that but it doesn't always make sense for us to do that because, I mean if if if new alt recipes are needed in the game now in the current state then you know we could do it but there's a very good chance that it's not necessarily needed right now and so we direct our attention to the next lot of content that we need to do and when we create new content it's very rarely that we can just make one piece of content and put that in the game it usually new stuff usually relies on other things to be done as well and so we have to do a bunch of different things before we can release anything and then so updates end up growing into these big packages out of necessity not necessarily because we just like them to be big packages it's because we add a bunch of things that rely on many other things right so like if we were if if we felt that we needed to just like the game needs more old recipes we could absolutely just make some extra old recipes for what's in the game now and put those out but it doesn't really I don't think we're rarely ever in that position where that makes sense for us to do that yeah, but, again like we you know we do usually do these big packages for updates but we don't want to be bound by that and it's entirely possible that this year that some of the updates might end up being a little bit smaller just because that's what logistically makes more sense and puts makes things easier for us and if that's the case then we'll just do that but, yeah there you have it that's that's a good question exactly yeah
