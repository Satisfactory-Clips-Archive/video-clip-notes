> is the plans are still to release two updates per year we've never had that as a plan, to release two updates in a year it's just that's just how it's happened to be, but that's never been a goal for us to release two updates it's just historically that's what has happened apart from a couple of exceptions, there's been a few times where we released three updates a year, not updates but like three releases I think because the the steam release was a proper release that was a huge undertaking, so yeah so so as to like is the plan still to release two updates a year no because the plan was never to do that it's just you get as many updates as we can muster to make you know so
