> My parents don't even know what I work with when i try to explain to them, but that is fine. Hi, i'm Sofi and I work here at Coffee Stain as a concept artist. I am the only one with a concept artist title, but like we are so few here that everyone helps out with everything. So if i don't have time for something then there is for sure someone else who can do a good job as well. I do concept art mostly, but I also do some programming, yeah, help out Jace a lot... As a concept artist here, I design and come up with ideas that i portray and illustrate, like machines and environments and creatures and characters, and yeah, you name it - i've done it. Like yeah, just try out ideas that we then can choose from and make 3D art from. So it's like fast preproduction stuff. My favorite thing that i've made in satisfactory so far, i guess, like it's so hard, but i think the character - yeah. All characters are fun to make them. There were sooo many iterations on it, like every time i felt like i was done, someone else had a really good idea that i had to put in there. So that was hard but it's like that with every concept, like there is so many iterations. It always turns out better as well, if you listen to the other people as well, but i just feel like &quot;im done now&quot; ... ...never done. Maybe also, i'm not sure if we are allowed to show it, but like the

> it's really cool. There is definitely both big and super small stuff to work on. The smallest one i can think of right now, which isn't that small but like for example the med kit. I'm gonna take the character as an example again, because it's a good example, like there are all these small little details in her outfit and like little lamps on the helmet and stuff like that, so always trying to get into the details as well. I would say the hardest part about concept art or working with concept art is like right in the beginning when you haven't got any inspiration or like, you have no idea where to start. Right in the beginning it is the most hard i think. Usually i google stuff and pinterest stuff that is close to what i'm gonna do, just try to get a lot of inspiration from different places. When i've done that, i'm starting to sketch kind of where we wanna go and take the sketches to the art director and he kinda gets to choose what i'm supposed to continue with. Sometimes he is super picky, for sure, and sometimes ... I can almost choose myself. Those are the good days. Caterina Parks I got like this character description: middle aged, very powerful woman. When you get to meet her she is kinda like - what do you say like - intimidating? I guess? So i had to try to portray that, i think it went alright. We have her now. We have Steve as well, which is Caterina Parks' assistant and he is like super ambitious but also really stressed guy doing all her tasks. I guess you could call him to get you a coffee, whatever. I did! It's a food court. We weren't sure what it's gonna be like, how many different food places, what they would serve and stuff like that. So i wasn't sure how big it was gonna be, lot's of iterations on that one. I was told we can't have fish, which is sad. I love fish. *sniff* The old design of the character, so like i said before, there is so many iterations with everything and especially maybe the character. With this one we tried so many different versions, we just wanted to try out different colouring, so that's what's going on here. Cause at this point we wanted us to be able to choose your character colour, maybe that will happen, i don't know? If you look at this one and compare it to the new one, like the helmet is super different, like this is so like: i'm. going. on. my. mo. tor. bike. tonight. or whatever. The main character or whatever if you can call it that, we wanted it to be a woman. So we tried making this mainstream kind of game character, like good looking, skinny, coolish But we wanted her to be more industrial, like this mix between industrial and sci fi is a main thing with the character i guess. So this one was kind of the beginning of the character we have right now, like the direction we wanted to go in. Then we made the final one after some meetings and discussions where we wanted it to go. So we updated it a bit, adding more personality for the character. Why is it a woman? Why is it guys in every other game? like what. That's a weird question. Why shouldn't it be a woman? Jace... you are killing me!

> I try to upload my art everywhere, so everyone will see.. but.. no one ever does. My main social media is Instagram. What I upload is also my personal style, so it doesn't really look like the art in the game i guess. But, yeah Even though i have my own styles, i also can jump into other ones, but... it's not my favorite thing. Yes..? Now it sounds like a hate my job. If i was to choose whatever i could draw, it would be like this costume drama hats and stuff. So if you wanna check that out, please do! And, what hardware do you use? Excuse me? What kind of hardware? A computer..? Who is your favorite person in the office?
