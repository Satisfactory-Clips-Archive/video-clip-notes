> hey Jason what are we doing but going on an adventure where we going Pizza Hut hey my name's Jason the community manager at coffee stain studios and today we're bringing you the update number two trains and nuclear power to you all so you can enjoy it we're gonna be doing something a little different with the patch notes and the feature highlights we're gonna be going on a bit of an adventure as we tell you about what's coming so in the spirit of trains and nuclear power snoot and I are gonna take a train to a nuclear power plant now if you're not really interested in the adventure there'll be a link in the cards up above and in the description below to just the patch notes website so you can just read everything there but we think this adventure is going to be a lot of fun and I hope you want to join us and check out a nuclear power plant hopefully we don't know if they're gonna let us in

> so the first major feature that's being added in this update is going to be the trains of course aka the electric locomotive so of course it runs on electricity which means you don't have to add fuel to it it's really fast it's really fun to drive around it has a high capacity you can keep adding freight cars to it as much as you want so it's it's super super useful in in that sense there is one downside however is that it is expensive you have to create all of the train track pieces yourself and they're expensive but in the long run it's usually worth it trains need to stop somewhere of course so we've also added train station the cool thing about train stations is they can be powered with electricity they then send electricity down the train tracks which power the trains but they also power other train stations and then if you have you know another train station at an outpost you can then use the power from the train station to power the outpost so you don't need like another cold generator or anything like that so it's really cool you can think of the train tracks kind of like power cables the other thing is you could also name the train stations of course to make things easier when you program the automation for your trains so for your train to transport cargo you need freight cars and so you can add as many as you want to a train and then to load and unload those freight cars you need freight ducting stations that are attached to your train stations and so if you have ten freight cars you can have ten docking stations and they will all load and unload when your train stops at a train station but perhaps you don't once you load and unload all of your freight cars at every train station and so what we have these empty platforms that you can put between docking stations so for example if you have ten freight cars at one station you may have five docking stations which load and unload the first five freight cars but at the next station you put five empty platforms and then five docking stations so that at that station it load and unloads the last five freight cars so you have a lot of control on how you want to do this and you can get pretty creative with it so we've also added switches to the game and what they do is they split the train tracks so that different trains can take different routes and so after you program your trains they automatically figure out the switches that they can reach their destination so we've also revamped the endgame areas the red jungle the red bamboo fields and the swamp and I'll leave that up to you guys to check it out yourselves so we have some new upgraded buildings available the miner mark 3 is now available and it is twice as efficient as the mark 2 and the conveyor belt mark 5 and the conveyor lift mark 5 are also available and they transport up to seven hundred and eighty parts per minute so you can now combine bauxite with silica to create aluminium which will open up a whole new world of possibilities like soda cans

> and so now here we are at the last part of the journey we're driving from Gothenburg 50 minutes to the power plant and schnitz little schnitz a little baby over here duh don't people kick the tires and that a thing if you kick a tire and it's like a good car I don't know this works so believe it or not I am here at ring house nuclear power plant and that is because of course we are adding nuclear power to the game the nuclear power in satisfactory creates massive amounts of power but the trade-off is nuclear waste which you need to find a solution to store and move away because it is harmful to your player there will be hazmat suits for you so you can hold things but that won't solve the mass amounts of waste that you may create the input for nuclear power plants will be fuel rods of course graphite tipped fuel rods what it's cheaper money doesn't grow on trees all right and so that's the end of our adventure today I hope you really enjoyed it we did not think that we would be able to film or get near the nuclear power plant but one of the employees there was gracious enough to show us a safe location that we could film because it is a protected place that you are not allowed to film so that's really really awesome so if you enjoyed our update video here and our little adventure consider sharing and all that sort of stuff and I'll catch you next time ok bye
