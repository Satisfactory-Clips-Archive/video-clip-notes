> any plans to change the train path thing from static to dynamic wait is that dynamic is it not dynamic right now example being being able to drive around a blocked path when an alternate path is available, so i talked i spoke to g2 about this and it's it's like he's gonna look into it but it's not trivial because, because of the way that the system is set up like the way the system is set up is we gain like some simplicity in some areas but when it comes to like more advanced like clever solutions like the one you just mentioned or you know setting up, , pathing where, it like picks an alternate path and waits there instead it's not really possible right now or like it's it's kind of tricky to fix that's all that, but i won't say like we won't do it or it won't like we're gonna look into it first before you know we know what's what's what's the situation but we like that might be a really big task, but who knows who knows but we are aware of that specific thing and we are aware of like what people want to get out of that or what they want to get out of the signaling system for those cases but we don't have an update
