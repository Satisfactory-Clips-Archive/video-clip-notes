### Transcript

> so I'm looking at the bindings now to see how it's hooked up this is their static mesh file that we've imitated you can see here this is where we've declared our custom spline data but I want to see where it's coming from okay so yes this is interesting so we have the f we're actually using their their mesh proxy, data type here, even though this is for the instancing stuff because it has all the information that we need and the splendish params so yeah this and I see here that they are collapsing everything into a single layout field ah that makes sense so here's what we're gonna do we're gonna take this so this is from the scene splendid scene proxy so if you're rendering a normal unreal engine spline it would be using this to render that spline mesh but it wouldn't be instanced so you could update it on the fly and everything go down to blind so here we have I'm trying to think if I want to just nuke these and I think I do yeah so this is how we used to do it and I'm going to do this for posterity it's blind mesh params because that is in the ush file should bind to all of these yes theoretically
