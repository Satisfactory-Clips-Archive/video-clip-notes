> because of how well satisfactory sold is it hard to balance when to stop because it digs into profit, yeah I think so but- I think we're in a really really like an insanely privileged position because of like how well it has sold and I don't think we're, limited by this is not really necessarily too concerned I think with whether or not it digs into profit because the thing is we still we're still selling like quite a bit of the game as well, but I think there's the other resource that we have which is, people can get like kind of fatigued working on the same game right and, believe it or not not everyone wants to work on the same game forever some people can do that some people can't and that's the other resource that you got to manage right sometimes there's like some people they want to move on they want to create something new or yeah and not a lot of devs are in a position where, yeah and everyone's fine now let me just make that clear like everyone's cool we're working on the game we're happy it's fine but but, you can yeah it's fatigue you can get fatigued working on the same thing forever and I get the feeling that we would get hit by that before we would get hit by running running out of money, and this is incredibly fortunate, that's just like 99 of devs don't really have that luxury so thank you all for allowing us to take our time make something we're very proud of and and to take it as far as we want we want to take it you know it also helps having a community that's so passionate too because, I know this is maybe corny and weird but like it's true like your passion and involvement like gives a lot of motivation to the team when they see what you guys are doing and when they know that there's so many of you out there that want to play the game, we're not just making the game for ourselves like for our own fulfillment we do it also because we know that like other people enjoy it so
