### Transcript

> and, yeah so we can just start with, state of Dave what is the state of Dave actually I spoke to I literally spoke to Dave recently the actual Dave merch Dave from heroic replicas who makes our merch by the way exclamation part mark, I asked him what is this day today and he told me he's doing great so that's good as for state of development, things are pretty good, we put out a patch yesterday I believe, I forgot to tweet it sorry but we, we put out a patch yesterday so there's more fixes and I think as far as like a lot of the major issues that people were having with update seven or whatever it seems like things are pretty stable according to what the team tells me and, things are pretty good so, fairly happy with it seems a state of things so far so there's that another thing is I'm not sure if there's going to be another update before now and Christmas but next week is our last week before the studio closes for one week, and then we're gonna be back so I think there'll be a there'll be a stream next week, and and then there won't be a stream and until either the 3rd of January or the 10th of January I'm not too sure yet, but yes next week will be the last stream for the year

>, basically so there's that as well and, as for development over the next couple weeks it's kind of always iffy around holiday seasons because some people just are just gone for when the the studio closes but some people like take advantage of that and, you know take an extra week or two before and after or something, you know so they can travel a little more and maybe visit their family because we have a lot of people at coffee stain who aren't from Sweden and a lot of swedes who aren't from kuvda so they they take this opportunity to go back home and visit family and friends, so yeah they're usually less work that gets done around these kind of holidays if you know what I mean yes yes, all right let's see Trio holidays thanks thanks, let's see is there anything else with state of Dave I don't think so I think in terms of like YouTube videos we'll probably get one little video out between before I go on break or before we we close, are you just messing with the quick line okay that's why I was confusing, yeah so I'll get like one more video out maybe this week or next week I'm not sure when, yeah the other personal lives I know I know right developers are human yep exactly who to thunk it, and I know some people some people aren't happy with it here we're on vacation because they're like but there's work to do on the game and like I get that I get that but, also we're we are people and it's not something that we're ashamed of that that we, you know people take their vacations in Sweden we get five weeks of vacation people take people use it all right that's just it's a normal thing here and so people use it, yeah yeah we're people believe it or not we are people you should be ashamed of being people I made sure maybe but in that case we should all be a little bit ashamed people could be kind of weird sometimes, Christmas break yeah I mean it you know and some people use their take their vacations around Christmas and some people don't some people take it at other times but at you know in any case, people in the office are entitled to their breaks so we take so we take our breaks and rub some people the wrong way but I think most people who care about us, are totally fine with it I mean when I talk to you guys there's like pretty much never anyone who's like upset here in chat it's usually it's usually some people who, don't really I guess hang out with us on stream or watch out videos and see that we're people I'm not sure I'm not sure what it is it is what it is though I could understand if some people are frustrated with like issues that they have in the game I get it but yeah
