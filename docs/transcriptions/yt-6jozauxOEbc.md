> you're gonna add glass with yourself right so then i could smelt the, that limestone node, so those of you who don't know i i streamed a, no dismantle percent version of, satisfactory so i wasn't allowed to dismantle anything that i built and one of the first things i did was i i built a miner on a limestone node and then i hooked it up immediately to a smelter to turn it into concrete when obviously you need a constructor and because i couldn't dismantle i couldn't dismantle the belt that was coming out of the the limestone node and i had built them too close that i couldn't put a splitter so i basically just wasted that node completely that was a bummer
