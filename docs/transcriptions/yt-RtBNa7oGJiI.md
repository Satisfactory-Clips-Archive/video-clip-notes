### Transcript

> fingertip anyway, so something else I want to discuss about is, something that we haven't put this live yet I think because we have because we haven't actually figured out how we cost this or fixed it specifically and I'm talking about the chic chi creek that a lot of people some people at least this may this might also be the case of like maybe the hardcore players are the ones figuring this out but some people really miss the fact that you can use the downward ramps anymore to clip into constru, to buildings and stuff to use them as like kind of like ways to like place splitters and ramps and stuff like that and then remove them so they're more like, what's the term yeah they're just like temp foundation and we fixed that in in the update four we still don't know how we've actually happened we've actually spent so much time trying to fight find where this happened scaffolding was the word I was looking for thank you we actually had spent so much time trying to figure out where we fixed this and like how because we didn't necessarily seek out to fix this we didn't I don't even know if we this is this is one of those bugs where like this isn't something that's game breaking and this isn't something that like ruins the game thus it's getting like prioritized wise it's it's it's not at the height of the list right like, so but we fixed it somehow and we still don't know how but we're gonna introduce reintroduce that bug, when we find it don't worry you guys, when we find it when we find it we yeah we it's so funny out, but, so I made a video yeah last two weeks ago wait yeah two weeks ago when I talked about this we are gonna do something with the build mode so so that you can achieve the same thing in the future without using the jquery I don't know if there's much else to talk like I don't know how far we've gotten into that process yet not really we started working on it now ish, but it's more concepting phase right because we were planning on making that better the whole clearance thing is just kind of annoying because it's not supposed to limit you and how you want to build it's supposed to actually help you not clip into each other right it's supposed to help you make things align and build them nicely yeah as the side effect of that you can't clip stuff because that wouldn't be nice but sometimes you do want to clip stuff so we have to kind of come up with a system that makes exceptions mostly for things that are considered cosmetics which is probably what we're gonna do right so we have different rule sets for when things are allowed to be built, clipped and then what kind of clipping we want to allow with what kind of objects that was kind of already do I guess that was such a better explanation of what I did
>
> [Laughter]
>
> that was fine yeah, but I guess it's kind of the thing where you're allowed to build belts for each other right and we don't we don't care because, yeah they're gonna make spaghetti you can make some spaghetti yeah exactly the people that care about the the the non-clipping issues are gonna build in the way that they don't clip essentially, I was gonna say yeah so so it's kind of funny that this is brought up because this was something that we're gonna do we're gonna do this regardless, it's just fitting that this discussion happens because yeah we're on the right track you guys, cool
