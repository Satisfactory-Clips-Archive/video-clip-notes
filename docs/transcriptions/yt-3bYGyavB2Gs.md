### Transcript

> considering how long game development takes how early does CS start thinking about what's next after satisfactory 1.0 I mean people think about it all the time I guess whoa how about you relax Siri for a second hey Siri hey Siri play despacito actually oh wait you have headphones it doesn't you can't do it, so I mean people have thought I think there are people who have like game ideas but I don't know if they're like I don't know if people are like bunkering down to figure out what a next game is and I don't neces I don't know I don't know if anyone coffee is listening right now but I don't I don't necessarily think it's a good idea if we do that like I don't think we should have games in the bank that we want to make because I think that like one of the best things, about coffee stain in the past when it comes to Goat Simulator and satisfactory is like the process that brought those games to to be was like the company-wide together or in small little groups would get into this big like creative mode and work really hard to come up with a bunch of ideas together and everyone is all hands on deck coming up with ideas and prototyping things and, I think it's really good if we can do that again it's proved to be really successful the past two times we've done it, and, I think right now when we're working on satisfactory I don't think we can do that because most people are are focused on the game at hand and they're not focused on coming up with new ideas in the future and so I think if we start like coming up with game ideas now for later we miss out on that entire process where we could have had so many other people who could weigh in, and and we're missing on so like like a whole wealth of ideas that we're not getting anymore if we try to come up with a game now instead of later so I don't know that's that's my opinion but I have no idea what the the situation is
