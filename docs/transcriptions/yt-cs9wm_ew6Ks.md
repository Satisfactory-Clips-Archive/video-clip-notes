> real and I'm excited for five five to six remaster look the remasters are fine oh is there is there remasters though always been disappointing like they say remastered and then like the font looks like trash and it runs okay final fantasy 6 pixel remaster upper scene will have real singing but do you want that though actually I'm I'm I'm split because a lot of the original like opera scene the the english version of that it doesn't make sense like, what's the word there's a very there's a nice word for this when the rhythm of what you're speaking matches the rhythm of like a a, section of music is it not cadence kate is a different thing that's that's how chords progress, I can't remember whatever cadence is a modulation or inflection of voice yeah it's not the same thing, but, whenever I play that scene it never matches at least not to me like it'd be it'd be like they'd be stuck on like some words I think they need to like change the translation of it to to be proper which maybe they've done I know there's been live why are we talking about this syncopation is not the same thing I don't know could be prosody actually maybe the patterns of rhythms sound rhythm and sound I don't know if that's exactly patterns of stress and intonation you're not gonna like I don't think there's a chance you guys are gonna rap it's like a music theory term, when you're doing because it is a problem when you're when you're translating something like italian opera and you want to translate it to swedish like you have to change the the translation sometimes because otherwise it doesn't make sense when you're singing it because it becomes too hard to sing it so a lot of translations in like swedish there's a lot of swedish operas not swedish operas but like translated to swedish and they are hella stupid because the translation didn't work out, right yes yeah timing is off and like sometimes they even change like the the rhythm, so and I can't remember what it's called but whatever it's not like I went to music school or anything where I should know this that was generally like 20 years ago though was it whatever
