### Transcript

> in the ETA on 1.0 yeah we just talked about that with, with Stefan our CEO we don't have an ETA, that was a joke, no we don't have an ETA like we the the problem for us still and this is something this has been a thing that's been going on for a long time like almost a full year now, where we have a hard time deciding sort of what the what the final release of the game entails if that makes sense like we it's so hard for us to say like okay these are the features we must have from 1.0 and these are the features that we should have for 1.0 and like there's a little bit of like okay but if we want to release 1.0 in a timely manner we might not be able to do everything so like what must we have for the game and what can we maybe do later after we release the game you know it's those type of discussions that we're having and, it's it's really difficult because like for for us a lot of things sort of have always felt like this is a must-have for the game but then when we think about it's like but is it though maybe not you know, so so like there's a bunch of things that we kind of fluctuate back up like back and forth a little bit like whether or not we have to include it or not, and I obviously can't give you a list of that because we haven't decided on that either so, yeah that's sort of why it's so hard for us to to figure out when we think we will release the final version of the game but it's not going to be this here I can tell you that much
