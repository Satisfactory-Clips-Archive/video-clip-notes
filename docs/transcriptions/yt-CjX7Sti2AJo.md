> can we have more stronger monsters in the game once you've reached tier five six months is hardly changing in building factory, so that's a weird thing, fat boy slim shady so like, some people think the monsters are too tough some people think the monsters are too easy you know in a game that is not about fighting things it's about building factory, maybe the monsters shouldn't be hard or shouldn't be challenging right having said that we do plan on adding a big crab there'll be a big crab that we're gonna add it's a really big crab, we're gonna add that at some point so that'll be a stronger monster but I think one thing to keep in mind is like we're not really trying to make it like an action game or anything so if monsters become too easy or something that's not necessarily a bad thing because we don't we we want them to sort of get in the way and to sort of engage you as your explorer and especially in the early game you know that should be risky in some in some cases you know if you don't have, like a good weapon or, you know items on you to restore health, but ultimately it's about building factories right and exploring so I don't know like I think if people say monsters are too easy at tier five and six I don't think like director mark chan is gonna be like oh we better make a change then I think he's probably just gonna be like that sounds fine to me but I mean if you disagree by all means, there might be posts already on the qa site about that upvote it if not if you can't find them make your own you know give us the feedback if it's what you want we do we do take y'all's suggestions into account you know monsters are too easy okay we like it's it's so strange like you guys don't understand we get we get, we get a a fair amount of people who say how can we how we need creative mode I'm not good at fighting monsters I hate these monsters they're too hard they're too annoying, can we have a peaceful mode peaceful that's what I meant to say, we get a lot of that so difficulty slider- I don't think I don't think we need it like I think I think you feeling strong and just demolishing the monsters in the later your mid to late game I think is a perfectly fine thing in a factory building game I think that's perfectly fine in my opinion
