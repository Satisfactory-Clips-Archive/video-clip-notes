> there's a very notable bug with pink gun used on hub and other early game buildings are there reports in qa site noted about devs uh i think so let me also point something out because i've gotten this question a lot actually outside of the stream um we see everything that that's posted on the keyway site like i promise we see everything all the new posts we we have people that like are legit checking daily what's going in um we can't respond to everyone and we can't like update everyone because there's a lot of duplicates and this there's a lot of uh issues that like we have a backlog that we're running through and then there's a backlog on like the keyway site and it's kind of hard to keep those in in track and like make sure that they're updated our producers are doing the best they can to keep those in sync but it's really it's a lot of work um so so but don't let that discourage you from posting the keyway site we do see everything and um we we appreciate all the the feedback that we do get on the keyword side but if you're not getting a response in your ticket or something don't get discouraged because yeah we do see it so i just want to let you guys know that yes we do see it we just don't have time to respond to everyone
