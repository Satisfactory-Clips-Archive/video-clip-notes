### Transcript

> any plans for elevator for us, for those of us that build mega factories I don't know what the plans are for elevators, yeah I just literally have no idea I'm not sure if it's something this is just the vibe I get and I could be wrong but I don't think it's something that we feel is so so important that it's gonna get it's gonna make the cut before other things you know what I mean like people want signs people on dedicated servers people want more optimization people want you know there's like a lot of things that people are asking and I'm not sure if an elevator is gonna be one of them you know when you've got when you've got, hyper tubes when you've got zip lines I mean maybe jump pads but jump pads probably aren't a good idea if you've got a factory that's so big
