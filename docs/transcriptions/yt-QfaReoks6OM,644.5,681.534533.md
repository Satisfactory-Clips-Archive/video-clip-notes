### Transcript

> Better late than never. But we're finally adding
Signs to the game. But there's more to them
than just fancy letters on a flat surface. So strap in! Signs come in various sizes and layouts, you can make small signs
and you can make big signs. You can also pick and choose
between many different types of layouts and icons to fit your every need. Signs can be placed on storage
containers, walls or just by themselves in the wild.
