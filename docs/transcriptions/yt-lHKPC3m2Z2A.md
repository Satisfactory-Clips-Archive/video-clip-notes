> I don't know the engine upgrade is probably also gonna break wads just putting that out there right now, because and it might break mods for a while because of how they rap mods like the the satisfactory mod loader which is like the the thing that's underneath the the underneath layer the handles mod loading therefore the name, that's like built for unreal engine 422, and now that we're bringing into 425, that will probably break mods unfortunately and, we're looking into, ways to improve this process with the community, this bit of, have to put it there's a bit of politics, on our end, to to like make it smoother but we are working on it we really wanna make it better for a modding community even though we don't officially support mods yet, we really like our modding community we really like our modded community and we want to make it like every update as seamless for them as possible, and, one thing that we're gonna do in the future after this engine upgrade is we're gonna make the game modular, which means that the game will instead of just one big like package when you receive them the game like when it loads it up it will load it in like separate modules which makes it a lot faster for modders or better in general, for mod makers to create mods and stuff like that so that's coming soon-ish I don't know exactly when that's gonna happen, as far as I know it's gonna happen before update four I know that I said last stream that it might have happened after update 4 if it affects it but the plan is is that we're actually going to get modular build out before update 4., so soon tm it might be we we kind of want to push the modular build thing right as soon as we can actually we've come to realize so hopefully mods will become better because of that
