> could you comment on terraforming slash inner infinite world generation, i'm seeing a lot of people asking for it even though it's impossible insanely hard to do yeah so i think the reality is that it's impossible insanely hard to do and is not gonna happen anytime soon if at all, we i mean i mean we this game started out to be procedurally generated once so like i guess infinite and we actually just didn't want to do that anymore like we tried it and we're like we don't like this we don't like that we don't have control over the world, any of those things, and then also with it being like an infinite builder when people are already pushing things like, performance wise with the game, within a fixed world like having an infinitely generated world is just gonna cause even more headaches i mean there are a lot of counter-arguments to that when that like well it could be a procedurally generated fixed sized world right but i mean it's then we don't get control of the thing the the level it's not something that i've think we've seen anyone that interested in having quite frankly so i don't think it's gonna happen and it's even harder now that we've sort of committed not doing that because that's something that you sort of have to decide at the beginning yeah and work on not something we can sort of throw in at this stage there is like some like things like, randomization with nodes or something like that where we you know that that's more realistic yeah we're not not saying that's gonna happen or not but like that is that is within the realm of like something that i think you know that could that could maybe be a thing if, our director and designers or whatever deemed it a good idea yeah but like terraforming like to the astroneer level or whatever is is probably impossible at this stage of development
