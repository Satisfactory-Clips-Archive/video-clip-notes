### Transcript

> so it's actually built on unreal engine 4 what's holding you back from linux and mac support there nothing really it's just the fact that like maintaining platforms is very very time consuming and it's like an additional maintenance uh that can like really slow down development and that's sort of why we're also not doing console uh until we feel sort of like we're in a good state with the game even looking at console i don't know if if we are gonna do console but like we we we really need to like develop the game first and foremost we don't want to spend you know our development time maintaining the game on different platforms like even just on epic and steam like that itself is is a big like there's a lot of work that goes into just maintaining those two platforms and you're saying like wait it's on pc that's not two different platforms it kind of is like when we're building the game we have to build the epic version and the steam version because they're different um and those systems are we've built systems to be able to do that so we can automate those builds and there's a lot of time that went into that too which is why like it took so long to get the steam version out just because we needed to be able to support both versions a lot of work that goes into that so so that's why like i don't i don't know if the build if the game builds for linux and mac at this point because we maybe when we try it we're like oh there's a bunch of rendering issues that we have to solve so that might add to it as well so it's just like you can't just take the game and just put it on mac mode and then compile it like it doesn't work that way like that way yeah and then and then like as much as you you want to believe that like yeah building just for mac means it's gonna you gonna have the exact same behavior that's like not really even the case like the amount of times that like we've been involved with you know having goat simulator run on different uh like even if it's like mobile devices or whatever you know you come across bugs that are specific to like a specific uh os and then you have to start doing fixes that are just for the one os um yeah you know and we don't wanna we don't we don't we're we're at a point in early access where we're trying to like design and finish a game and we don't need that stuff right now like getting in our way and distracting us exactly
