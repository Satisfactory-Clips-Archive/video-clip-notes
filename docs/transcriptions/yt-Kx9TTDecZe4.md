### Transcript

> please answer yes or no are you are you going to matt stop moving are you going this chat I swear to god why doesn't it pause like chat pause through the scroll still scrolls though, are you going to share something important related to coming in next updates, not intentionally I don't have any plans for it maybe unless there's a specific question for it, no I don't think so or share something important like I don't have anything planned, I don't know how much you know specifically about the next like maybe there's something that you don't know, that's the hard thing about this like I don't have any I don't have any news to announce today right, but there might be something that people haven't heard before on the stream and that's kind of like because to me I like me and jace we repeat ourselves every single stream right but not everyone is here during the streams, so and sometimes we like to allow like it's nice to be able to elaborate also that's why kind of we like doing these streams as well is we kind of like to be able to have the option to elaborate on specific things and you know sometimes we do make videos on youtube about stuff that a lot of people ask about but it's really hard to know you know every specific thing and sometimes people are really good at you know carrying that information like further to other people sometimes information gets misconstrued which I see a lot on the forums unfortunately people say like no the devs said no and I'm like oh it's actually more complicated than that, so whenever people are like posting just like dev said no, there's oftentimes more to it than that you know, so like unless like there are obviously okay like console for instance like ha devs like when people ask like is there gonna be console when people say devs I said no it's like that's not what we've said we've said we haven't planned for it right it's not impossible it's not like it's not like it it can't happen we just haven't planned for it right now that's, we're not like stuck up like that we were just like no we said no it's not gonna happen like we're we're constantly changing our mind about things and like sometimes maybe like someone will imp like sometimes we get technology from epic that's like oh that makes it so we can do this thing so like it's anything's always possible we can only say like what we plan for and don't plan for, there are few things that we're like definitely like no like we know for certain we're not gonna do tower defense like that's one thing that a lot of people always ask, that we know for sure like it's not gonna happen, but there's also like when people just say like dev said no like there's there's a reasoning behind it too try to share that as well so I always I always try to jump in when I just see like jeff said no like I was trying to jump in and be like well actually this is this is this is the big picture right or like this is why this is not possible right now
