> any chance for update parts for the vehicles next year uh what do you mean with update parts do you do you know what that means sorry i missed it i was looking at something else before any chance for for update parts for the vehicles do you mean like more because i don't think we're going to add more like vehicles for the game but we might like i don't yeah yeah uh i think there's been talk of like doing stuff to the vehicles uh but um we'll see we'll see if that actually happens but i don't i don't think we're gonna be adding new vehicles because i don't know if we i mean we've already added the cyber wagon where else where do you go from yeah where would you go from that yeah exactly i mean you know like but for the most part like the vehicles that we have kind of do provide like the different things that vehicles could offer like of course you could add more but like it depends on what they're going to do and whether or not we want to do those things yeah and then and then and then like do we want to put in all the work necessary to actually then add a new vehicle yeah um instead of adding something else like it's it's always for everything like this we have a huge backlog of stuff uh that we also want to do and you know the community has like we have a huge list of like stuff that we've sort of accumulated from the kiwi site stuff that we've always wanted to do with the game um and and that list is humongous okay like we can work on this game for many years to come and there's always going to be a point where we just have to say like okay this is what 1.0 is going to entail for the game and we kind of have to like draw a line somewhere so sometimes it do be like that in game development where you kind of just have to decide um yeah like there's always going to be more good ideas but we can't we can't do everything not for a game this size we can't well home is for almost for a game of any size you can't do everything you want um and uh so like the suggestion of like motorcycle um so again like a motorcycle doesn't really add much because we already have a vehicle that's pretty quick which is the explorer um we have a vehicle that's kind of snappy but a little hard to control which is the factory card and then you also have the uh i keep forgetting what they're called blade runners yeah you've got the blade runners which like speed you up dramatically already and you have full uh like control of your locomotion so it's like i'm not sure what how much value adding like us designing modeling rigging up a motorcycle uh tuning it and then like balancing it into the game i'm not sure what that's actually gonna or how much that's actually gonna end up giving apart from it being kind of cool if we just snap our fingers and put like a cool motorbike in sure but like that costs something right and it costs the time that we could be spending on other things so like i don't like it we need a pretty compelling specific kind of vehicle to add a new vehicle yes when maybe tweaking what we already have uh is maybe even enough yeah fun for dlcs like who knows we could like i said we could work on this game for a long time there's a lot of ideas yeah uh a little fun fact i was playing through like one of the early prototypes of satisfactory and i the factory cart was originally like a quad bike apparently i don't know if you remember that chase no i don't remember i certainly don't remember because i i wasn't there at the time but i i there was a little quad bike that was like super low poly that you can drive around and it and it drove exactly like the factory car so it really feels like we took that for the factory card very cute
