### Transcript

> um any chance for mod support this is actually something that might be interesting to talk a little bit about we don't know when mod support will happen official mod support uh we kind of have like kind of have inofficial mod support because we are trying our best to help our modders but uh like prior to wise we have to prioritize the game and it's it's it sucks for for the modding community uh in some regard because it can feel like we're throwing them under the bus at times but we have to do it because we can't move forward with the game otherwise um and it's a bummer and uh we try we always have the modding community in mind when we when we implement stuff and when we uh you know working towards official mod support um so we try to try to be as helpful as we can but but yeah sometimes it feels like we throw them under the bus and we're really sorry about that it's just it's just the way it is you know um so we don't have official mod support the mod support that exists right now is completely inefficient and it's completely like driven by the modern community we don't have any like pushing that uh so all the credit to the modern community that they're so like engaged and and so like driven um where's jace jason on vacation and they're so driven and it's it's honestly amazing to see we did not think we're gonna have like this level of of um uh of what's what's the word here uh jace what's the word like we wouldn't think moz would be to this level at this point right we thought like this is something we'll see when we have official engagement yeah well engagement and like like the mods are really good like the the the support for mods is also amazing like the mod loader is also like something that i don't see in a lot of games sophisticated yeah like there's a ton of dedication and the level of quality is really good too like our mods are super good to our game like compared to to a lot of other games um the modding manager in itself and like the whole like structure of that is is insane i don't think i don't think enough people understand how much work goes into the whole like ecosystem of the mod manager um so like we're totally super stoked about that and we try to not step on your toes but sometimes you know it happens i i know that like we clash sometimes when like we we've we're implementing a feature that somebody has made a mod for and then that makes the mod kind of irrelevant uh sorry i mean that's that's kind of how the cookie crumbles at times um because you know we're not gonna like not add a feature that we think would benefit the game even if there exists a mod for just because we want to give like that mod highlight or something like that so so yeah that's that's the topic of mods and but yeah we love our modern community we try to support them as much as we can it's a little it can be a little bit frustrating at times because we we feel like we could have been moving forward with some things with the game overall if we weren't do that but also we know that it's gonna benefit us in the long run sort of doing it this way having this like kind of like half solution with supporting the months that we do um so yeah that's just something that i wanted to bring up and talk a little about um that being said we don't have official mod support if you're running into issues and you have mods installed you're kind of on your own um because like i think it's like 80 of our bug reports or crash reports specifically are because of mods crashing um and like i get a lot of messages from people like hey i'm getting an issue and i'm like okay do you have most insult and they're like yes and i'm like can you try booting the game of vanilla and the issue is gone and and i get a lot of that so it's like a lot of managing that as well um so just like help me share the information with that as well help me share the information that like if people are getting glitches make sure to verify the game files and if they're using mods uh try booting the game in vanilla and see if you still have the issue um so yeah that's that's uh that's the end of that
