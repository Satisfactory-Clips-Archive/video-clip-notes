> and then, and, next up on the list here is that, a little bit of announcement i guess not really a big a deal but, so we have our experimental branch and we have our ea branch and, the experimental branch is where we're working on the engine upgrade right now and there's still a few things with the engine upgrade, specifically specifically a few bugs with unreal engine, that we're still trying to like find and solve before we feel like it's worth rolling it over to to early access, just because we don't want early access to be like a lesser version than than what it already is and there are the point is that it's supposed to be stable right exactly exactly you can't step backwards and for the most part the the engine upgrade is going pretty well and it's working pretty well for a lot of people but there are some cases where you know people that have way bigger factories they're, experiencing some like slow downs and like some weird issues and we're working on that and we've apparently found out that it's a lot of that is because of bugs with the new rent like rendering pipeline in a real engine so we're trying to solve that with epic, currently but that also means that, the move from experimental to early access has been delayed a little bit there are other reasons as to why this has happened as well but that's one of the major ones i guess is that the fact that we don't want early access version to be, worse for some people until we like actually fix it, and right now it feels like the experimental the engine upgrade won't go to early access before update four is the main thing i wanted to get out here, so you won't see like the engine upgrade on ea until after update four has come out, so that's that's essentially some kind of announcement i guess i don't know how interesting it actually is but maybe some people care about that stuff or they're wondering like what's happening with early access or experimental right now yep
