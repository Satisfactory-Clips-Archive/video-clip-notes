### Transcript

> are we expecting any more patches prior to update five i mean there'll be some stuff probably when uh for um localization there might be some minor fixes but we're in this like weird situation with the branches that um they differ so much between update five and what's currently live uh that if we were to make some sort of fix that had to be live we we have to essentially do it two times now and that's something we tried to avoid for a long time but it just slowed down development and so now we're at this point where we don't update what's already there as much anymore in the interest of speeding up development for the future updates and again that always sucks in the now but it means you get more content in update five arguably better quality because we didn't have to like jump around between things we don't have uh you know we can get things done sooner you know so like these are like weird sacrifices that do certainly suck in the moment but you know we have to think long term and most folks understand that stuff and appreciate it you know most folks in community don't mind uh but i'm sure but you know it's it's still it still screws some people over for sure
