### Transcript

> uh i'm curious in light of factories news about their expansion do you expect to have any sort of post 1.0 content besides bug fixes fixmes et cetera dlc uh right now we just want to finish the game we have we have ideas of like post launch content stuff but it's like it doesn't matter right now because we need to finish the game first so um we don't really want to play we're not really planning that stuff just yet uh it's it's entirely possible that the game will end up going 1.0 without some features that we think would be good in satisfactory and then in that case post content makes a lot of sense uh but um we'll just have to see what happens it's just not yeah it's not really important for us just at this moment
