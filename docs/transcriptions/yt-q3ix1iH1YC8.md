> and percentage how much stuff are you holding back for 1.0 we're not really holding anything back for 1.0 it's more that like I guess the story is the major one because we're not going to release the story before 1.0, I don't know like it's I don't I wouldn't really say we're holding anything back for one point it's just like our work schedule means that we can't make everything at the same time you know what I mean so some things we have to plan ahead for 1.0, and it's it's kind of going like we also don't know like how ambitious we want the game to be for 1.0 because one of the aspects that we've kind of been doing the last couple of weeks at coffeestain is by like doing retrospectives of like how we worked up to this point and how we want to work in the future and one thing that we're also trying to like figure out is like how much can we work like how much more time do we want to spend on satisfactory

> you know so that's another aspect of it well like how much more do we want to add and I think it varies from people person to person like officing like some people are really super hyped for like adding more and more stuff and other people are like let's, let's just finish it up, you know so, it varies too and that's something that like our managers also have to like somewhat take into consideration when working on the game because you know it's it's it's also like an important aspect for an employer that if if all your employees are sick and tired of working a game then maybe we shouldn't work on that game you know and then we should do something else and maybe ship it someone else or I don't know, and that's never impossible but you know it's it's gonna be us for sure until 1.0 and then after 1.0 we'll see what happens, maybe we'll keep working on it maybe we could make dlc you know we'll never know
