### Transcript

> that's a good question what about tier viii okay this is something i want to talk about me and jace have been very like whenever we talked about tears and stuff, as far as as i've known okay we've always said there there's only eight tiers in the game right there's going to be there's only going to be eight tears in the game, and then jace did his q a video last week when he talked to our game director mark which we'll probably have mark on the stream again soon-ish we were planning to do it last week actually but shift just keeps like shifting around but, he mentioned that there might be more than a tears in the what that and like jace found that out as he was making the video, so up until this point we've always said like there's only going to be eight tears but apparently that might change but it's not going yeah more than eight years confirmed pog, i i wouldn't say so but any nobody listens to what i say anyway, but it might change in the future i don't know, but it was mark kind of teased it too to, jace i feel like so yeah so maybe we'll do a tier minus one because we have a tier zero, well maybe that's what he meant with more than than eight tiers and then like that tutorial tier is is the ninth tier i don't know we will see it like the the game is still in early access anything can happen like we might think like a conveyable let's just rip them out just use laser beams instead or something you never know never know with us you never never can never count anything out we gave you pipes even though we said it i'm not gonna give you pipes
