> what about lights in the game so like I mentioned this earlier but I'll say it again, lights is pretty performance heavy, and it's it's a tough nut to crack there is a light mod but if if you've used it extensively you also know that you know it's it's quite performance heavy and that that's not like I don't think that has anything to do with like the implementation mod itself you know like I think you know that mod that implementation that mod is properly proper is probably pretty good the the problem is that the way you'd have to implement lights is tricky because they're really expensive, I remember when I ran a performance test on it it was like I don't quite remember it it jumped from like when I did it on that safe like even even in like a pretty small save it jumped from like, okay I don't quite remember remember but they were pretty high they were quite significant just adding one light, so so yeah it's it's it's tricky
