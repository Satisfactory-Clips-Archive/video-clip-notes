### Transcript

> another question, so uranium fuel unit recipe requires beacons when are we going to change it to remove beacons, so the message I got from you know internally is that as far as where you know, we haven't removed beacons so you can still use it, even though we're planning to phase beacons out eventually and so when we do remove beacons we do plan on adjusting that recipe, now obviously adjusting recipes can be a headache for you guys because it can really with your factories, but there is at one point there will at least be one other balancing update at some point and we don't do this all the time because we know it's really bad for your save files, so but we will add you know we will try to do it all in one update and we'll give you guys a bunch of heads up so that you can get ready for it and things like that and so when we do that this old recipe will probably get a change as well as we remove beacons but you guys will get a lot of heads up for that when it's going to happen we'll make videos we'll talk about on streams and even at that point still not everyone will hear it I'm sure it's because of that alt recipe that we didn't remove beacons originally completely because we could have changed that all recipe in the same like in the update where update six where we did away with the how beacons work on the map we could have gone away with the alt recipe too but then if it felt like oh if we just do it for that alt recipe that can affect a lot of different recipes and then we might as well just look at all the recipes at the same time instead yeah yeah it's it's not a it's not a really good reason to mess with your save files at this point just to remove beacons and when we say messages or save files to this day people who, who were even part of the closed Alpha before we launched their save file still load to this day so like we do we do intend to maintain compatibility the only thing is that if your recipe if the recipe has changed they will change in your buildings and so your factory will stop functioning but your let your save file should load that is how we've had it all this time and I assume we will keep continue going with that in the future I feel bad to break up the streak if we did that yep also I don't really see why we would have to but who knows maybe something will come up hopefully not though
