> a mark two basic machine scrapped feel like, come back I feel like the building gets too complex and large in the late game becomes a chore so yeah we don't have any plans to make mark ii machines just because of the sheer time investment that would be needed for us to do that, like we wouldn't want to just like slap another mark like decal on the machine we would probably want to make the machine look like a mark ii machine if we do that and that's very time consuming to like essentially make every single machine again in the game, so that's that's mostly why we won't make any mark ii machines and it is it's one it's one of those things that like it's one of those things where we we'd just be moving the goal posts again we've talked about this on stream like a lot of times like people always want more and more and more and more they want everything faster and quicker now and like that's fine right but if we give you a mark ii so you can do things quicker you're gonna you're gonna reach the peak of that setup and then be like where's my mark 3 now right so it doesn't actually solve the problem you will always have that desire to to make more make it quicker right like that's not something that's ever going to go away and so I don't think it's something that needs to be like addressed or like it's not really a problem that needs solving yeah in my opinion
