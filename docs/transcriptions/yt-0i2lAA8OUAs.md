### Transcript

> uh i'm really wondering if there's a very long-term plan for random world generation uh there's not really a long-term plan for random world generation because uh i mean first of all we haven't even finished with the current world and then we haven't really finished with the game at least in the way that we are envisioning it at the moment and so if we were to do something with like it's not as if it's not something we haven't thought about and it's not as if it's not something that's not in our backlog but whether or not we actually end up doing it we don't know and if we do it's probably not going to happen anytime soon but there's different levels of like randomization right so we can randomly generate the world or we can do other kinds of random genera uh generation with an existing world and so you never really know yeah that kind of thing will be a thing yeah we can't do like uh terrain to be randomized but we can like maybe randomize the nodes and stuff like that um
