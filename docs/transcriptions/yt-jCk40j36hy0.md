> okay I guess we can move on to the next thing which was actually also coincidentally a lot of people wanted to know what's happening with merch stores eu merch store last week and I looked into that but then more things happened okay so let's just talk about all the things so first of all some of you may have seen out there that there's now there is now a mug available you guys, lizzidoggo.com, there is now a mug available for pre-order there okay so, the so the situation with that is the whole like lizarddoggo.com thing it's actually if you guys remember dave from heroic replicas who did the, you check the link, the guy who does the the giant, plushie and also smaller plushies and also, the xenobasher and stuff like that, so dave had done the fix-it campaign and that went all the way through, and then he has then made this website which, folks can folks who did not back the project can also go in and order, pre-order some stuff as well, the expectation around the pre-orders and what the backer or the deliverables for the backers I believe is supposed to be end of quarter q2 so quarter the second quarter of the year, and those well those would be but then replicas will be will be shipped later, q3 or something so that's kind of the timeline for that stuff, so this this site sort of came around just because, you know the folks who backed will get what they backed, the folks who backed can also, I don't know how they do this but maybe you get an email with some information but you can also like the coffee cup ended up being made so that those folks can then add the coffee cups to their back to their backing thing as well as an add-on if they wanted and, folks who do that actually don't then need from my understanding is they don't need to pay shipping because the the shipping is covered by the rest of the backing that you've done for the for the, for whatever it is you backed okay so that's that situation but then everyone else who did not take part in the kickstarter can then pre-order, whatever via this website as well and so the cup is there now a couple things with the cup, first of all it's some folks might notice that it's, it's a ceramic cup whereas you know the cup that we ideally wanted to make was an enamel cup right but we had to go with ceramic in this instance we did try to go for enamel but there were some serious limitations on the enamel cup which were making it very very hard to happen and we're still going to try and figure out a way to get an enamel cup but for the moment there's this ceramic cup this ceramic cup is dishwasher and microwave safe there is another cup available which is the, employer of the planet cup which is kind of like gold that one is not microwave safe that one is, dishwasher safe though so, yeah so these cups are available they're technically out there now and you can pre-order them if you wish, let's see here there's a little bit more so one thing that, is one thing that, I is probably worth clearing up here and some folks over on the I saw on the reddit for example a lot of people noticed that, shipping to anywhere outside of, the u.s is a little bit expensive similar to that with our good smile store, and that is because this store is again a north american store it's not an eu store, and I know a lot a lot of folks were a little bit disappointed by that because y'all have been waiting for an ear store for a while, and the shipping can be a little ridiculous in in certain cases it's not so bad if you buy multiple things but maybe you don't want to buy multiple things then shipping is a little bit ridiculous and so this whole idea of us making an eu store or finding an eu store of some kind is still an ongoing thing that we need to do this is not like a substitute for that so like one thing that I want to make super clear here is like you know we we partner with good smile or they used to be for offense by fans and they've got their own store and they do their own thing and and they ship from the us and dave you know from heroic replicas has his own store and he's doing his own thing and it comes from north america as well and so I just want to make clear here that this isn't our solution to the eu store or anything like that this is dave doing his thing and we partner with him and work with him to make cool merch much like good smile are doing their thing and we partner with them to to make their merch, but clearly neither of these two partners that we have right now have a have a decent solution for eu at the moment and so the eu store is still something that is ongoing that we're looking into it's just incredibly hard like this process is much harder than we thought it would be it's taking forever to figure this stuff out we had certain things come through and then certain things fall certain things certain possibilities we had and then they fell through which is a bummer, but you know we have a couple more leads and so we're just going to keep working on it, and yeah so we do we do think it's important to find an eu solution but we're still working on that and what that solution might look like it who knows it might be one partner that delivers stuff from eu it might be multiple partners because it's really hard to find someone in eu that can can supply a mug to eu as well as shirts as well as whatever whatever whatever so we might have to get a bunch of different partners and then people will just have to look at different stores to find whatever goods they want for whatever region they're in so it's just it's just a really difficult situation to, sort of solve in a really elegant way and at the moment the the only thing we can really do is just partner with various people to hopefully eventually, get some constellation of partnerships in place so that folks can get what they want, from whatever region they're in so they don't have to pay too much for shipping but right now this is all we got this is the best we got and big pat on the back for dave for making this happen at all, okay so like again it is not ideal for folks outside of north america I understand that but it's but it is it is a cup that is happening, and we will continue to strive to to to improve the situation if we can, yes so that is that situation there hopefully I've answered all questions there I don't think there's anything missing you blasted yeah you blasted through the notes perfectly yeah yeah yeah so I hopefully that clears everything up hopefully, and I've seen some people ask if like dhq or rather I think you mean embracer but like the parent company can help us and they are helping us, when it comes to you know figuring out the whole situation yeah so so we're in talks with them as well we have we have other companies within the, embracer umbrella that we can sort of like talk to and yeah so we're talking to them but we're not limiting ourselves to them as well like we're trying to find a solution yeah, some interesting question here it's weird that for an eu student have more difficult difficulties to do things in the eu, I mean yeah it's because it's because like like we're not the ones who actually make the things right we have to find someone else who does that so I don't know like it's it's honestly just a a weird situation, it is weird but it's it's not easy it's a nightmare we've talked to other developers too and they're like yeah it's a nightmare merch is apparently always a nightmare okay so all we can do is just do what we can make things a little bit better step by step and we won't give up until hopefully we get, a situation that we're happy with yes for sure it like it makes sense because there's so many like pieces here and it's kind of hard to like explain exactly why it's so hard to get merch to work but it's it's so many pieces running and it's like production cost and shipping and like all the different legalities between countries and shipping and like covet code so it also affected this a lot so it's it's so hard to like you know put it all make it all happen because it's just so tricky, not something that I was aware of myself until we started doing this, but yeah it's it's just and and so like ideally what would have been really good right is you know like, this the let's just say for example with this coffee cup, ideally you know we ideally wanted it to be enamel we wanted it to be available to everyone in the world you know right away but it's like first of all the enamel thing is proving to be impossible all right we've been trying to make an enamel mug for years and it still hasn't happened but we could make a ceramic one right away right and and then like how do we get that to eu then if we want it to to work everywhere well we don't we after all this all this searching we can't even find like a good eu partner just yet right so it's yeah it's a real pain of the butt, but we have what we have and it's it is some still some cool stuff so hopefully hopefully some folks will will enjoy the new merch that is available there oh another thing that I don't think we've actually mentioned this by the way, on good smile, I don't know if you can open this up it's not sure can I think, where it is I can put the merch in the chat if you want to just click that and open up the window one thing that I don't think we've actually mentioned yet on stream which is bonkers so, on our good smile store which used to be okay does that oh you copied the other part yeah, we're good chat don't worry about it just wait wait up to the 907. one second wait for it there you go yeah yeah yeah yeah you guys didn't even so we we used to we used to sell a merch through four offense by fans right but they're sort of like merged with good smile and now basically things are sold via a good smile, so if you just show the thing, you all will also see that there is another lizard doggo plush you guys hell yeah, that you can pre-order and I think the pre-order there's a little pre-order bonus where you get like a little pale berry as well yes, so super super cute again ships from the us though so the shipping situation is still kind of is what it is, but you know super cute liza doggo and it's a different style to the one from dave from heroic replica so you know like maybe you want different styles of doggos or maybe you prefer this one or the other one and so you've got different options now for cute little doggos, yeah it's got blue tongue too that's the most important aspect of everything here yep blue tongue blue tongue don't take this out of context but what is the cup size I believe the cup size as a 10 is 10 ounces I think it says on the yeah it says on the website 10 ounces I don't know what 10 ounces is because I don't I don't I don't I don't speak that one 10 ounces empiric what is it it's, 295 milliliters that's almost a soda can yeah ish sounds like regular cup size to me it's about a c it's about is that the average one I don't know what is the website so if you can do the merch command, you've got there are two sites where you can, order or pre-order things from we have two two stores right now, yeah so exciting stuff with the merch yes there was another thing and it's not like, you know there's still more things happening on the merch end, we don't have anything more to announce but just so you guys know like when it comes to e-store or like all that stuff we're still looking into that and pretty sure jason made it very clear but I also want just we're still working I think it's it's good that we make that clear because I think there were some folks out there who thought that because this story the lizarddogger.com store came into existence then that was our solution for the eu it's not like that's just dave running his store right, and and that's that's all that is, but we're still looking into other solutions
