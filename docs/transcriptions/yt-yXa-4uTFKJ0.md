> question about update 4 trailer music was it written for you or is it a coincidence that music really fits the game theme so uh that was made by uh i forgot yes dennis but it was like he's part of a duo yeah uh they're called but but we we uh they made the music for us and so in the past we've made music for trailers uh we've made music uh trailers with music that has already existed um and it yeah and then we just make the trailer to fit it but but but in this case we did sort of like uh we requested that they made so so the way the music that was the case roughly uh so the case for update four was that they had a song that they fitted for the trailer so they they had like a song that they had made for that oh really um oh okay and then they rebranded that song and like made it work with the trailer and then i believe they updated the released version of that song for like this is the satisfactory version or whatever if i remember correctly i know that they had that song goes to an empire that's them goes to an empire thank you i was like trying to because it's on the youtube uh video there's a link to that song yeah exactly and it's really dope yeah
