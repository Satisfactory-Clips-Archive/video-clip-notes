### Transcript

> a few weeks away so let's do a wrap up of uh what we've been saying the last couple of streams actually about state of dev i guess so we are in what's called a content lockdown which means that we've done a feature freeze which is the same way of saying that sorry uh which means that we've decided like from from now on until the update is released we're not gonna add like any more features to the update we're not gonna like we're just gonna focus on fixing like what we have currently for the update and you know get the exact optimize yeah lock down and in every way yeah um and just work on that and play test a lot so we've been play testing a lot the couple of the last two weeks i think we've been in feature freeze um and working on like performance issues and networking issues and stuff that were introduced with the engine upgrade that we haven't really been able to like put time into because we've been so focused on fixing the stuff for update four um so we're in that like big bug crunching kind of mode now where we're just fixing things um to to get everything done for the big update um that's coming in sometime in march mid-march-ish we don't have like a lockdown on the date just yet but soon soon yeah um we're thinking probably next week we can maybe maybe give you guys like a definite answer the exact date so yeah
