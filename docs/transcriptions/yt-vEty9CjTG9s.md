> you guys have planned to add additional custom swatches I just can't get enough, I don't know there's some there's some kind of technical limitation as to how many swatches we can, I think for the custom one though we felt that like what's the point of having more but if you think there's a point then go to the kiwi set and up with that, I guess it's nice because like you have the ability to save like the colors so I don't know maybe you say maybe we save you like a click of having more custom ones I don't know
