### Transcript

> There's been a huge update
to automated vehicle pathing and the systems surrounding them. Previously, automated vehicles
would drive blindly at their next waypoint without considering
where they'd be going next. But now vehicles will take
the next waypoint into consideration when driving,
making their pathing much more reliable. We've also introduced a basic obstacle avoidance system
to handle cases where vehicles might run into something in their path. Vehicles
won't completely recalculate their route, but they'll do their best
to get going again. And in the cases
where vehicles do get completely stuck... Then, as a last resort vehicle ghosting
will make sure the vehicles stay on track. They're not the only changes
we've made to the vehicles, though.
