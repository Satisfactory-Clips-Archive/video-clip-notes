### Transcript

> it's really cool, and then we got dylan how do you do here I'd you know not much I think recently you've mostly been doing networking stuff yeah that's still behind the scenes at the moment yeah so, but I did for this build I did the sub level saving yeah overall so that was the main thing I did can you explain what that like actual like benefit for people I wish I could, I guess it doesn't offer too much initially but the idea we've run into the problem in the past where we want to have more world actors that can save and things like that but it comes with a performance hit and so it was hard to justify some of these things so now that we've moved a lot of the actors into the sub-level tiles that stream in we can have more dense save actors and everything because those used to be loaded all the time and that was not very good for performance so now they're moved to the tiles and basically what I did was make it so that they can save before anything in tiles was unable to save so there's a big save migration that happens and hopefully that means more content for more more items in the world going forward yeah it can save and everything because I think ben you mentioned that like having the sub level saving system also makes it so that's less like render yeah, because you have less primitives like objects in the world to consider yeah because otherwise you had all the sport flowers and all the gas pillars too I think yes pillars although those were yeah and then deposits all those all the pickups were present so and all those head parameters and how rendering works it just takes everything it's like I am my visible am I visible that my visible so yeah it goes through absolutely everything in the scene social level helps quite a bit for that does that also help for factory stuff where it's just like for voltage or, no for things in the world that game designers mainly place okay yeah so it won't really help like in the cases where people have been like massive safe files and there's a bunch of like because that is a huge part of the cpu cycles when we're trying to figure out like what do we call and and and sometimes it's like not worth doing that like calling pass it's just like all right whatever render everything because so many things to check for that anyways yeah yeah pretty cool, but I feel like there's something more that you made that I mean really I've just been hammering on the complete networking overhaul yeah, which unfortunately isn't ready to go live yet, soon in the future soon tm soon yeah yeah but that should come with, like also the conveyor rendering improvements on clients it comes with that fix to those changes so those are in the pipeline yeah now I realized that the reason why I brought you up on here in this past as well was because you you did the initial pass on the note lists yes yes I was I was thinking that might be worse yeah it's not for the saving okay nobody gives a about that no I think people care about that it's just like they won't get the the like I think a lot of people are looking forward to like getting faster save times and stuff like that yeah which isn't necessarily what this is for correct, unfortunately since the factory is the majority of the save time and not really the world actors yes but it is optimized for the world actors now yeah unfortunately that's such a small part of this save time that it's almost negligible yeah exactly but that is that is a future thing maybe that we're and yeah we do have some ideas for optimization too yeah as always to speed up save and load because it's both like speed up say but there's also like we could also like hide the the saving experience a little bit because like it is technically I mean it's kind of actually a lot of work to do this but we could do it so that you can at least like walk around in the world while it's saving and stuff like that and pause the factories and stuff like that but that also introduces a bunch of yeah states that can, yeah we benefit from saying okay here's this save state and we lock everything and then process everything sorted and then save it out and that obviously has some benefits and then the downsides being yes you're stuck yeah that's well it's doing all that yeah
