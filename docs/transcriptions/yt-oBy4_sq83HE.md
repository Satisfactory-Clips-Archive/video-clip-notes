> does the game push the limits with the unreal unreal engine I've yes and no cause like it is it is a it is an infinite builder which means that you know technically you can you can push it so that you you crash the game which you guys with the object limit issue have so I mean technically yes I guess but we're not really doing anything super like we haven't done too much like custom stuff within real engine we're not utilizing any like you know we haven't done any new research on like new rendering techniques or anything like that ourselves or you know we're still making what exists so laughs in 10 fps
