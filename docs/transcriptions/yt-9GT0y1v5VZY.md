> what is the object limit and will it be increased in the future so the object limit is is unfortunately hard set by unreal engine and that's not like game object limit that's like data object limit which is it's not like uniformly spread across game objects in the world like like there are more data objects for a constructor than there are for power pole right we can't increase that but we can't optimize it, we can't like all right we we talked about it during one period we can technically we can't increase it, but practically we really can't, so like at some point you're always going to hit a build limit but we are optimizing a way to try and decrease that so that that like you can build more and more essentially but you're always going to hit a limit at some point, i can say one thing though i see a lot of people, that send us save files when they hit like the the object limit oftentimes these people have used like the mods like the reactions mod and a lot of times people don't notice that they place like a ton of stuff underneath the map, so if you're hitting the object limit i recommend checking or i guess it's kind of hard in the in the two-dimensional save editor but i think there's a three-dimensional save editor correct me if i'm wrong like or that's that's a common problem at least so maybe that's something that we should look into but all i see a lot of save files where, people have placed like a ton of stuff under the map and that counts towards the save the the the object limit and that's something that you can never use so you're just shooting yourself in the foot there, it's a c limit z limit option all right cool then check check out check out that thing if you're running into that issue, because that's i've run into that that's pretty common
