### Transcript

> yeah, last thing that we, that i didn't say actually is that you can no longer delete nodes i think you can at the moment right on non-update five versions of the game you can no longer like delete recorded path nodes, and one of the reasons for this is because of the nano machines because you could technically if you had only had two nodes before you know the the target and the the beginning and the target you could delete all the middle nodes and it would just nano machine quickly across the map right, but no we thought of it all okay so you cannot delete the nodes, so you can't really exploit the nano machine system either, you can't like nano machine your way around the entire track very quickly because what the the conditions for the nano machines to kick in is that you're stuck for a period of time and so it's always going to be more efficient for your vehicle to drive between the waypoints rather than get stuck wait x amount of seconds nano machine to the next waste point get stuck for x amount of seconds that's not really going to be beneficial for you so you have a strong incentive to drive
