> so, just to iterate, some things that we said earlier in the stream, we are going to oh was that weird, we're going to be pushing an update a small little update to to the game maybe today maybe sometime this week, that's going to be just some minor bug fixes not anything big, and we're going to move experimental over to ea, the current experimental right now to ea so, oh yeah yeah and one important thing is that we're also in that experimental update we're going to be updated the engine version from 4.26.1 to 4.26.2 which is a very it's a minor, engine upgrade change but it's one nonetheless and it's possible that it breaks mods, it's possible that it doesn't but i'm not quite sure, what the implication is there so if you want to keep your mods or whatever make sure to play on the ea version, of the game, and we might be rolling out yeah an update to experimental, with some some some small bug fixes yeah ea is early access not not, enter advanced as many people electronic arts yeah early access yes everything will run 100 percent yes for sure everything is always perfect, and, if you didn't know satisfaction is on sale you can get it for with 30 reduction third thirty percent off thirty percent off on both steam and epic and maybe on humble bundles satisfactory i didn't check that one we tend to put them at the same time but yeah it's all it's off on humble bundle too so if you have that like humble bundle like choice thing of a jig you also get an additional like something less per percentage which makes sense it's very exciting exciting times, all right cool well
