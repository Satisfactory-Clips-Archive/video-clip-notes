> is it is it possible to have the autosave not noticeable at all i don't think that's ever going to happen there's always going to be some form of hitch uh and it has to do with the fact that like we can't run saving in peril we have to like serialize everything that's happening in the world and in the in the one frame because it can update like everything's so complex in the way that everything affects each other um it's possible we can like make it a little bit better and like segment segmented out like there are we have ideas on how to improve the save time um but i don't think we'll ever hit like a point where it will not ever be noticeable like at all
