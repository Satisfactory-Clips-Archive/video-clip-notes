> um there was another question uh will we get notified in advance if uh of map changes so we can repair our builds on what to delete and whatnot that sounds like a really good idea i think we should yes i think we should do that like even if we release like a map of like this section has changed heavily consider moving your out of there because like i don't know to what extent the world team has changed things but it could be that people load their game and just can't reach buildings anymore i mean that's happening before it has happened yeah uh i think we're gonna try and communicate that yeah it would be good to do that for him but you know like even if we did that beforehand we're not gonna get it out to everyone even if we spam it on twitter on facebook uh we'll do it here on steam on stream we can do it on steam we could do it on discord uh and then that update will come along and people will get emails and messages saying hey i can't reach my things anymore but you know we can mitigate it right we can get most people who are yeah it also helps uh when people in our community help each other out too because i still see a few posts with people being like hey my power isn't working anymore and it's because of the whole 100 generator change uh and like i didn't know this so uh and then people can help them out and explain like yeah it was changed blah blah so we i think our ambition really is to try and especially since we started doing the open dev thing where we we kind of want to like give you guys some time to prepare so when we know that like we are going to change some aspects of the game and we know that that's going to infl like impact people's current build setups uh then we're going to try and communicate that so that you guys can uh prepare runestone snow dia biome next to the desert uh but corgo and galion both saying we have in-game announcement panel maybe we can announce uh you know on the main menu there um yeah well that also entails that people play the game in between yeah that's true between now and they might not have picked it up in the right they wait for the update they're like i want to see what's happening yeah and they start playing this is the thing with our with our kind of job where like we we can never reach everyone like no matter how many different ideas we come up with like oh but what if we change so that the whole discord flashes up like upside down and tells you no one can type until they've read they scroll to the bottom of it like no matter how far you go like you're not gonna be able to catch everyone and that's something you have to just accept but we could do our best and catch as many as possible but uh it's like i mean those suggestions like putting it in the alert and things like that i think that that's that's not unreasonable i think that's like not too much work for a lot of game um but yeah a lot of the times with these kind of things we have to measure whether or not the effort is worth it i think the effort is probably worth it for those suggestions in particular but yeah
