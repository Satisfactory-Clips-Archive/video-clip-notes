> how do you what do you have to do to become an art director like- I do you go to art director school or like what's the what's the path to like art director, yeah it's a very, yeah that's actually a really good question and, wow I wish I had a clear answer to that, I think it's, usually it's appreciated to have like a foundation like in hands on art I mean I come from I come from, 2d I started off as a 2d generalist and I did a lot of ui work and 2d general work and also then did concept work and, I just developed towards the direction of taking over responsibility for project, as a lead artist meaning, , pitching like a pitching the the style of a game of a proposed game project within a company to management and saying I think we should be doing this of course in collaboration with the team coming up with a with a with a plan and then I'm going to sell them and make sure that, that we achieve what we set out to do so, within a smaller team and in a relatively small project and along the way learning stuff and teaching yourself about, yeah about yeah art direction in general what it means like what what is what does a coherent look mean and then looking at why does why do some movies or games have a like a very nice bundled up coherent look like it's all like it built up a nice world and everything fits into that world and why does some, some movies and games fail to have that so like maintaining a coherent vision for example, and I guess it's it's yeah it's partly it's partly getting started as an artist I would recommend getting started and as artists because you need to understand the work of an artist in order to direct artists that's a valuable thing nice
