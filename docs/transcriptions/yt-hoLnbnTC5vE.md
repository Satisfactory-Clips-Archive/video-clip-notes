### Transcript

> do you think we'll rework radar towers in what sense like are we happy because that's a pretty good point too are we happy with the the way the map works in the game with like the exploration aspects of it I think we could do a lot more with it, also the radar tower if you think from a purely gameplay perspective then I think there could be more benefits to having it, and the map has always been the suspension point of like we kind of wanted in the mam but then you also as a new player you don't even know that it's there, how do you know where to get the map maybe it's just something that we should give by default or it should be way clearer that you can get it in that quartz research somehow, there's different things there but yeah I want to do more with the map in general as well wait do you not get the map from from the map right now yeah you do yeah okay I was like oh yeah yeah yeah you get in the quartz research pretty pretty easily but the problem is that generally you don't know that it's there you have to know yeah I've seen a bunch of people are like hey why do I not have the map yet and it's like because you haven't researched it that's true yeah maybe that's one of those things you don't want to put behind a progression wall like that where yeah, raider towers have no use, I guess they help you like what do they actually do I've never used onex they reveal parts of the map yeah that's it right yeah because we have to think they could do more yeah we have talked about like maybe being able to like scout on the map stuff because you have the like an upgrade to your, object scanner because right now the obvious scanner is just like it just looks so the closest one in proximity whereas the radar tower could be more like in this area you can find that's pretty cool though like you get an area of effect on the map where an object is I was also thinking it could just constantly show you what resources are within its radius so you don't have to constantly scan for them to see them that kind of becomes an issue of course with the compass but I think we can figure something out for that yeah that would already make it more practical another suggestion I think that burke gave me a while back was that if we do the logic system or the circuit system however you want to call it that could be a really cool use as well for the raider tower to potentially send data from those kind of systems over longer distances to other parts of the factory right so there is some more potential for them I think both with the map and other features that we might want to add
