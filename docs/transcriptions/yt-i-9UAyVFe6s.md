### Transcript

> somebody asked if there's achievements plan for satisfactory and there are achievements planned for satisfactory, we just haven't, implemented anything yet because we want to kind of like finish the game first before we start doing that, yeah don't don't want to balance achievements for a game that's not done yeah and a sub question that was too if there's if we could add any achievement that's related to speedrunning maybe and I don't know maybe we'll I don't know yeah I don't know it sort of depends right because like if it could be a thing where like if you finish the tutorial maybe under like a recent a decent amount of time could be maybe considered as thing but yeah I think I think it's like you know if again if like 99.9 of your players are gonna play are not gonna play in a speed run fashion let's just use speed running for example then then like having you know a lot of people like to to to accomplish all achievements right get all the achievements and so having an achievement to do something that like you you were never there to do, can feel a little weird sometimes yeah it is it is really difficult to design achievements, because who like at least from from from my experience when we've done on previous games it's like so hard to know who the achievements is for and like where you draw the line like is it hard to get achievements or is it easy like when does then we'll get the person who's played three thousand hours be like oh I got that real quick it was easy it's like yeah yeah three thousand hours dude of course you did so but we'll see we'll we're we'll probably put some time into this and make sure that it's as balanced that's the rest of the game
