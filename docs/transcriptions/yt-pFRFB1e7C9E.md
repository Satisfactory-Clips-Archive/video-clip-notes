> what's something you want to have in the game, working pipes that's one thing I would also like it so that, guidelines work that's another thing, I've been playing a lot satisfactory recently so I'm I'm a little bit bitter, the the next third thing I wanted my list is I want so like lifts when you put them on floor holes that they don't like turn around, that they stay consistent in which direction they're turned towards the on top of that I also want that for spitters, splitters spitters spiders I want them to always be facing north, you know that's one thing guidelines what are those never heard of it they work for most in most cases but there are like certain certain edge cases where the guidelines just like give up can you play spitters on floor holes if you try really hard I think it's possible

> I think the thing that would, what was the thing chris said the other day just like I feel like the the things that have the biggest effect for me personally in our game that I would like to change are like the small things that you do often so like I'm not super interested in like oh we need to have farming or whatever because I still haven't finished the game like I still haven't done you know up until tier whatever tier seven and eight you know that I haven't done aluminium I haven't done the I haven't done nuclear I've done any of that stuff like the things that really make a difference to me is is like the small things like lifts not rotating when you place them and stuff like that because that will save so much time, in the long run instead of being frustrated every time single time I have to use lifts and like the way they snap to the the so frustrating like a tight build system that's more important for me than you know cool features in the game I'd rather have that than have like helicopters and stuff like that
