### Transcript

> so we're going to showcase a bunch of the weapons mark already spoiled the pulse nobilis oh my god, which which I think is like one of the coolest things we've added to the game because he wanted to do the jump yeah yeah yeah like doing the rocket jump stuff is so so much fun it's awesome, and when I was playing, my favorite thing was to do in the update with the new weapons were using the cluster obelisk and, like using the pulse and the cluster to like pulse up cluster and then try to like hit the enemies with the cluster grenades yeah so like you throw it up in the air and you try to like ring down on them yeah, I love doing that right
