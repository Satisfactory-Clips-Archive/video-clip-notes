> see is there a goal amount of events per year what do you feel about that mark a gold amount like or no goal like uh we've had the event right do we have any other events planned do you think no not right now um we really have to take them case by case i think because currently our planning is somewhat in disarray we've actually been talking about like kind of fixing up our road map um for a while now and maybe once we have that more cleared out we can see what we can fit in um i mean the the fixmas stuff of course worked out really well uh because we just dedicated some additional time to it because we felt that we could do it within the update for planning because everything was was going really smoothly uh but if we want to do something for like easter or halloween and those kind of things it just really depends what the state is that we're in at that point if we just launch an update or if we're working towards the deadline it really depends so currently we're not really planning that in because we first need to kind of plan out to uh planning how to get to 1.0 um say again i think it dropped out for you it would be dope i think to do more it would be dope i can't argue that's awesome
