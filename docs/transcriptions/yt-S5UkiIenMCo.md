> constant art book that's something that we've actually thought about doing um it might happen for like 1.0 but um seeing how like there's still things that haven't been released in the game yet it kind of like we can't really put out like a concept book when there's still like things that we haven't revealed so that's mostly why we won't be able to do it until 1.0 but maybe once the game is released we'll be able to do that and that's something that i think we want to do can you post that concert art developer highlights video i sure can um it's on our youtube channel uh with sophie
