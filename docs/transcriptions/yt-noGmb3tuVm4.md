> smarter splitter for pipes how would that work because you can only have one liquid in one pipe segment so like you wouldn't be able to split them in a smart manner anyways

> truck splitter how does that work wait you I just imagine like a truck going into like a box and then it disappears and then it comes comes out of like one of the other openings valves I've actually did what they're supposed to be fine if they're not doing what they're supposed to then please go through the QA site and leave a ticket with like as much detail as like why they're not doing what they're supposed to or because that can also help identify if maybe you're not doing it right, if there because if there's a certain situation where they won't work or there's like an edge case where they don't work, then give us as much detail information so we can look into it but every time every time someone tells us like hey the pipes are broken and that's it we we checked them out and we're like the pipes aren't broken or the valves or whatever so yeah be specific be specific
