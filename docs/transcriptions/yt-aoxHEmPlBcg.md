### Transcript

> still hoping for blueprints saved in Steam sync for GeForce now use yeah we've seen I've seen a lot of people request that and it is a bit of a bummer, I wonder if that's just an oversight for us like no we can do something about it there was that I know it was intentional yeah because we yeah there's there's did we consider that that would affect GeForce now users, yeah I think so because there was some, I'm trying to reawaken the discussion I had, with the person who made it, because like the main thing we wanted was to you know not have them be part of the save file because there's issues like having blueprints be part of the safe all really ruins many of the aspects with like being able to share them and, you know being able to use them on multiple save files as to like why they're not part of the sink, yeah what's that right I'm trying to remember what was the reason, I'll have to get back to you on that one actually follow-up follow-up, because right now I can't remember but I had an extensive discussion about it actually and and it's like it's like it's possible but there's many issues with it, so it's like it's it's the whole thing like I said worth it it can actually cause more issues than that actually is beneficial, and like if it's only the St is it only like the people on GeForce now that suffer like really suffers for it then you know that's the whole thing like do we wager that against the entire playbase sort of thing, but yeah and not we'll we'll give a little follow-up on that next time we'll do that we'll do that there's also another follow-up that we actually did but it didn't get answered so I need to follow up on that follow-up and then we'll have a double follow-up or you guys like follow-ups so we put a follow-up in your follow-up so you can follow up follow up the follow-up that we can follow up next week yeah, good good I'm glad good, probably takes up too much space I don't think it's too much space because like the save files are way bigger than what a blueprint file could would ever be yeah I think so I understand correctly we also yeah exactly because the safe out in a way is like a big blueprint of your entire level oh could it be nah never mind it could could be something with the desync thing where like you would actually encounter a lot more of that you know the thing where like it doesn't match what's online because the blueprint files change more outside the game than I do inside I don't know we'll follow up on that yep
