> are we getting close to 1.0 relatively close Okay the, close as in like oh it'll definitely be out in a couple of months clothes I think like it's been it's the closest it's ever been you know like yes to a certain degree but are we close though, kill me oh, a very diplomatic answer it's it's the only answer I can think of like because we have no idea when the game is gonna be done weren't you also closed last year that's what I said like we're as close as we go we're closer now than we were then okay I mean without losing your job I wouldn't lose my job if I just said like well I guess I could technically but I mean who cares what I say if I was going to say like oh the game's coming up tomorrow people would know it wasn't going to come out tomorrow
