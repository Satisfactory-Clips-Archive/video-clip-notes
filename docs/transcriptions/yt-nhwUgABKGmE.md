### Transcript

> no you were doing the same one were we do your plans for port for mac osx, max mac os or linux, that's not something that we've planned yet but we're not like against that idea we think it would be nice to have it on on both versions, we're always felt that we would do it yeah we're focusing on windows for now, and then you know in the future we can look into that and the same thing goes for console like we also haven't like, decided on that yet we're focusing on the pc version right now the really difficult thing is finishing the game yeah right it's just a it's a really hard game to make and it can go in many different directions and finding the right balance you know taking on suggestions from you guys and stuff like that is a lot of work and if we have to spend us a a a decent chunk of our time trying to, get it to run on other platforms then we're going to be splitting our focus basically yeah so we want to just like the hard part is getting the game done yeah so we just want to get it done first especially seeing as like when you're releasing on more than one storefront you also have to maintain the version of that storefront so it's just like even that's one example of that issue right so like once we have other os's and if we were consoles we'd be having other storefronts as well, that work just keeps compounding on and on and on we find ourselves spending so much time just making what already exists work everywhere instead of pushing the game forward
