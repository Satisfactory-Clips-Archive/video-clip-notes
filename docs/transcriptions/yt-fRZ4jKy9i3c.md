### Transcript

> the vehicles have collision detection for other vehicles i believe so even though what is he always yelling my dad he's got a really strong voice it's his accent you know yeah uh i don't i don't know um if they have collision like they definitely do when we have physics enabled that's that's why you've seen like the weird jumpy things but like when they simulate i don't know if uh if they will collide or if there's a maybe maybe there is part of that system the rework that we've done that like they sort of figured that out in the but maybe that's also part of the answers that you got chase with the queueing system we haven't done that yet uh sorry i got distracted what was that i could tell i could tell um whether uh vehicles will like collide when they're when they're simulating and i don't i think they will collide when they're simulating no while when they're when they're doing non-physics simulation they won't collide because they're kind of their physics are off they just kind of fly through the world but um when they're normally driving and physics are being simulated i think they can uh they will yeah yeah um i think there was talks of like having like clever avoid and stuff i don't really know to what level that's going to be in or if it's going to be in at all yet but yeah yeah that was the thing i wasn't sure of whether or not that was something that we had done with the new system because you can you can run into an issue then where if you have two different paths like an explorer or a truck or something and they both exit the uh the simulated like distance off of each other on top of each other yeah then they're just like boying yeah but then already yeah but then the ghosting thing will sort of take care of that i guess yeah yeah so so yeah that's the thing i think that exists now and that's the thing that i think still might happen in update five but um so you might see it it might look weird uh but it will fix itself yeah make sure to take a selfie if that happens yeah yeah just record it record it please it's it's hilarious to watch not even kidding that's a knee slapper yeah it's it's so much fun seeing that stuff
