> does the game can the game be played in VR one day, so this is something that's been requested by various people over the years but generally speaking it's a fairly low priority to get the game running in VR since like it would take a lot of work to get it running decently at all, and to get the in-game mechanics to work in a way that feels good in VR so that's, that's a lot of work and then at the end of that the game itself doesn't really move forward it's the same game you could just play it in VR and so right now we don't really feel like, that's a good way to prioritize our our efforts right now we think it's better to prioritize it and things that will push the game forward or help the game itself so VR is something that generally falls to the Wayside in that case so I have no idea if it'll happen in the future or not maybe there'll be some simple support for it in the future who knows but yeah I wouldn't count on it personally
