### Transcript

> okay because here I am everything I can yeah those those cases I guess are are more edge cases so that's why we'd rather have the aoe, because oh boy and you guys have no idea what it was like when you were collecting biofuel it used to be way worse with the biomass generator as well like you couldn't like the biofuel thing is another step we added before then we didn't have that, you may buy a mass and now we have solid biofuel as well but like and then imagine running around collecting one thing at a time as well and the chase I was chainsaw was only like forgetting wood you didn't get like anything else from that essentially, it was a pain in the ass there are a lot of things that changed in this game for the better since I like played it first time honestly holy like for instance the minigame that used to exist when you were collecting ore where you had to like hit the what game is that it's gears of war like the reload minigame and gears of war we had that for like when you were picking war and I don't like you still got ore I think when you were picking but you got like extra ore if you hit the circle thing I guess do you remember jace, yes it was like and the, the area that where like if you clicked or you had to you had to click yeah you had to click within like a specific area on the circle as the thing went around and every time you clicked it it got smaller and smaller so it's harder to get like, like combos basically it was so frustrating yeah I just remember frustrating there's been a few things that we've done that have been so frustrating that I'm so glad we didn't include the last round we did for update three was we tried implementing like a cool down on the workbench so that you wouldn't, be able to to, like manually craft as fast holy that drove me insane, we also did it in such a way where it was it was tied to the specific workbench so like the workbench would get heated up right but you would you could just build a new workbench and start over so we just have like playstation we just kept like building workbench after workbench just because they would never cool down awesome annoying and I was I was so confused as like how so many at the office like that they were like yeah this is great I'm like no there's like a camp of like yeah let's keep the cooldown on the workbenches and then we sorted it out with our fisticuffs yeah we we chainsawed them death wow a bit intense yeah hey don't question our methods
