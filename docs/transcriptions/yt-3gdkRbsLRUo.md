> can we customize the pioneer in the future for multiplayer so that's something character customization of some kind, is I think something that we'll end up doing I don't know how advanced it's going to be but something as simple as changing colors makes a lot of sense especially for multiplayer right yeah so I do think it's something that I imagine it will happen before 1.0 I just don't know when it's going to happen
