> did you both do film school no I didn't no I no I have no training in that whatsoever I just I've just made a lot of videos when I was growing up I did a little I did a couple semesters of, acting class though, did about like a year of just you know like going to acting classes in in once a week yeah with a with a group of people it was really fun I've done it yeah I've done one course of acting or drama because it was for stage play more but, yeah and then yeah I've been in one opera in school but that that's not acting that's, opera acting is like oh I can't believe this oh I can't believe you like stuff like that yeah I did I did when I did the acting I did like stage acting and it's you need to be really big and I'm like not good at doing that stuff I'm you know like I much prefer being close where you could see every little movement that I make because I'm not really comfortable doing like really grand gestures but maybe that's something I need to work on you know if I want to get backed or if I want to get better at acting then yeah but if you thought our acting was great during the muted start that's because we've had a lot of practice with the muted part you know because every single time we start the stream we're muted you know right right
