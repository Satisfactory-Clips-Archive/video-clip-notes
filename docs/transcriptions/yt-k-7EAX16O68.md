> some trees that can be cut down previously have grown back in update six that can't be cut down that is a bummer but I think that's a dedicated server issue right, and those are things that we're like when people are reporting on the kiwi site we just have to like take along and fix them as they go the trees that still can be removed in non-server it's possible I think I've run into a couple but, for the most part people are reporting it on the dedicated servers, I think there might be a few but the only thing we can do is report the location, on the keyword site and stuff like that there's like a we added like in the map you can mark or like see the position and stuff like that so you can probably just tell us like hey at blow I can't get down this tree check out the map at least in update 6.
