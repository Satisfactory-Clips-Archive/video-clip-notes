> so much power the power requirements vary per recipe and always fluctuate so check your power grid before using these bad so you can see here that the uh the uh particle accelerator ramps up in power over time that's what this kind of like uh image here shows that it ramps up as it creates stuff and then it drops and then it ramps up and then it drops and that's kind of how the particle accelerator uh demonstrates here so you know like with our community um we know that people are really really sort of like anal they go frame by frame by every video that we create so we know that like you know simply creating this simple grid will put the information out there other people will figure it out and jump on reddit and they will put it up thanks for the poster check um yeah our community are again yeah they are i mean i i mean i mean they are no it's good i mean it in the best possible way it's a good thing we we we want that we love that right uh and and we create like literally this scene is a reason we we create this kind of scene because we know people will sit down look at these numbers look at these graphs and and figure it out themselves yeah so uh yeah it's like part of the challenge whenever we reveal stuff because we have to like double check everything like three times to make sure that like all the details like people are gonna figure it out like we've never had i don't think we've ever had maybe the you know the blink thing you did a long time ago maybe that was the only time where people like didn't catch on it yeah but very rarely do people miss yeah exactly we reference we make it is safe for us to assume that people will figure things out
