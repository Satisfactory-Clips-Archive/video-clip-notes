> unreal 5 switch when fun fact no just kidding, we're actually we still haven't ruled that out to be honest, like switching to Unreal Engine five it's it's a lot of work okay, because we have to switch out the entire physics engine we have to sort of change some of the we have to re-implement a lot of like optimizations that we've done to, to, like a renderer and yeah it's just a lot of work if we were to switch to Unreal Engine 5. the thing with it like there here's I'm gonna get I'm going to level y'all okay I'm gonna level okay this is between you and us okay the thing is like there are a lot of cool stuff in an Unreal Engine five not well partly the like nanite and Lumen like those are cool but they they won't like impact the game the most there's a bunch of other stuff that we we think is gonna be really beneficial, like epic are when epic makes updates to the Unreal Engine they make Banger updates okay like the the patch notes for the engine updates they're novels okay there's so much that goes into that engine in in between updates and, in between update that like the 426 or 27 I can't remember what is the latest update and unreal and four version but in between four and five there were a bunch of other stuff that like we it's like the grass is always going to the other side right so so like there's a lot of stuff we can gain by switching to Unreal Engine five but it is also like but the road there is so bumpy you know so where it's not ruled out completely, like if anything we actually do want to kind of pursue it but I don't know if it will happen to be honest at this point I we'll see I will definitely keep you guys in the loop if we do switch it do it for Andrew's Bill I'm not sure if that will well maybe there'll be some optimization improvements but like it might also be that we take a step back in certain aspects but, but yeah there's definitely there's definitely cool stuff in real Engine 5 that we are interested in, and and I guess that's sort of the you know that's the Crux of active development development like this where we've been trying to keep up to date with the engine as much as possible but whatever there's an engine update we always have to weigh the benefits and the the like the costs and, you know make a decision around that and, I feel like this time around we've been more sort of like cautious about it and think more about like what it actually entails because it it do entail a significant like workload but but at the same time like the one thing I mentioned with like the physics engine like we have to completely swap out all the fixes physics in the game but at the same time you know we do have a bunch of issues with like Vehicles how the physics work and stuff like that and we believe if we switch and like physics engine maybe those will be resolved so like we do need to fix those physics issues anyways so maybe like we should just you know get to it and switch, but then but if we do switch there might be other issues that we didn't realize, creeping up that might be harder to fix than where if we were to stay on the old engine version so that's just like one of the discussions you know there's there's a lot more so yeah it's it's a tough it's a tough call I'm glad I'm not the one making so yes, let's see here yeah yeah it's yeah changing an engine in the car is a good like analogy like sure you can do that and you swap it to like a from a V6 to a V8 or 12 whatever but like you know the design of the rest of the car has to work with that engine
