>, unreal engine has default control support, regardless of you guys mapping it yeah yeah it does but the the main issue here like the issue isn't having input to just happen in your your, in the game but it's like there are there's so many different functionality things in satisfactory that probably outweigh how many buttons you have in a controller or if the functionality would even work in a controller anyway, so that's the part that we're not paying attention to at all which may limit what you can do or maybe make it so you can't play but i mean if it's working that's great, yeah what he said i don't know but i mean it seems to be working for a lot of people that's really great that's great i yeah like i heard people saying that a couple weeks ago when we said that there wasn't a support but that but we didn't do it hopefully it's magic
