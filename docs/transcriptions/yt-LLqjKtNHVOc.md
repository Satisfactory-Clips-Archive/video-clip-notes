> sorry I just I saw a funny comment, hi everybody welcome back to our to our, to our streams our highly anticipated dev streams they all tune in for to every goddamn week for some reason, so sorry about that but we've been away for a while we're we've been on winter break and, now we're back can't believe it we are indeed we're gonna we're gonna kick off the, the year with, the stream here today and, yeah stream every week is the plan as we did last year apparently what we only missed like two weeks or something last year yeah one week apparently what was it one week it was one week of like dev stream but we did we did we didn't do like this kind of setup every week we did a couple of times where we streamed the game and we did like the you know the epic showcase and that stuff but we did stream at least once a week last year holy which is nutty, so yeah welcome back everyone glad to have you all here I'm just so dirt boar is coming I like jason's magic shirt and mic because I got like dots on my shirt and my mic is dirty as and it just blends in it's supposed to look like that man yeah very good it's it's part of this style, so yeah we're back, we're back and kicking now even though we're back, doesn't mean that we have like anything huge to announce or anything like that we're kind of soft-storming starting this stream, or whatever because yeah this year, because, you know kind of like state of dev isn't really state of dev this week because we're not really like quote unquote working yeah we're mostly planning stuff for for the year and, you know what that's gonna entail and we don't really know what's going on honestly yeah, I mean people at the office do but me and jase don't really know what's going on right now I mean even people at the office don't really because I sort of know what they're doing and they're figuring things out basically so, yeah pretty much and so it is kind of weird you know like because for the the the season of update five was pretty long you know we started it a little bit early and we had streams and videos and stuff going out for a while so it's been it's been like quite a while since we've been in a like a quiet place in development but it's like important to remember that this is part of the the thing and so, in the in between moments we're just gonna have to hang out we may not have news we may not have anything to show but we can all keep each other company and, try have some fun anyway and, once there's movement we can we can start partying again get down brass exactly exactly
