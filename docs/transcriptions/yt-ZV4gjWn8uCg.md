> are you tired of answering the same questions every day uh not really not really no actually yeah actually not really but the thing is it's part of the job like answering the same questions over and over because i'm sure to the people who are here for every single stream all the time and maybe it gets annoying to hear it and you know you maybe you would be annoyed answering the same questions over and over but it's it's our job and the other thing that we need to think about is the people asking like maybe it's the first time they're on the stream right yeah or you know they weren't here the first half they were in the second half um so you know when you when you think of it like that it's people who just want the information it's it's important for us to try and get the information out there to as many people as possible and so answering the same questions over and over on stream might seem a bit weird but we're still answering them to hundreds of people at a time so um it's it's pretty good i think it's important and it's part of our job so to me to me doesn't bother me so much no same i'm used to it the one thing that might frustrate me frustrated me a little bit is the fact that like there's no like there's it's impossible to reach everyone and like there's no way for us to be like put a like when is update four coming out for instance like there's no way for us to be able to like just put that out there and everybody sees it yeah but but like i also don't mind the grind of telling everyone like over and over again because it's not because you're still helping people that's the thing you still help people like each time uh what's up
