> i think the price for mark three and four are great mark two i skip almost every time yeah so that's the thing like if you know mark three and four are coming then you'll do that decision but when you're playing it through the first time like maybe you won't do that but i tend to do mark ii belts as well, just because if you get like a really good setup for reinforced iron plates, then why not you know i already have like an overflow of reinforced iron plates at that point anyway
