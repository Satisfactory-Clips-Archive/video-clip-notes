> you see the world record for four package percent was set last night at 23 hours nine minutes so- I rated, Epiphany when he was doing that and he was into hour 19 at that point, it was impressive, that was before that's they're still playing on on Early Access so blueprints don't exist yet in the speedrunning, right for those things so I'm really curious how that will change speedrunning but yeah I wonder if the if the bottleneck is building or not yeah I don't know at this point you still need to hook everything up even if you do make those bills, and maybe you know maybe they figure out like here's the best way to build it so that it's fast to hook it up or whatever, and it's like Dragonheart he could have done it faster hey it's a world record give him a break you need three hours come on not fast enough literally no one is quicker than him yeah we're not fast enough though could have done a foster yeah I think the frame here that is that is good feedback though maybe you should let him know yeah I'm sure he would love to hear that actually, actually for his words was that his words Dragonheart did he say that himself okay so I think it's a hilarious thing to say regardless yeah yeah, so yeah no but maybe maybe yeah I'm curious to see how that will change that, but I just think it's so incredible like the four package percent thing is is nuts to me like like so much time but I think it was a pretty big what was the record before then, my brain's telling me something like 40 hours yeah a 40 like it was like around 48 yeah, speed on RX speedrun.com satisfactory yes so we're both like racing to see who can look it up 100 that's a yeah man wait no runs oh update six day five updates 26 6 26 hours okay so it's not been okay so it's two hours faster or three hours faster ish that's pretty good right that's a huge I think one that was like 40 or something hours maybe that was for, because he also did like the weird stupid like, only mark one belts thingy like no unnecessary I was thinking off but, he's also done a no dismantle one Jace oh did he do one, -huh no one told me [ __ ] I think see that he talked about it but it was the pioneer of it where is the it's not on the speedrun archive but I think he because they have a bunch of other on the Discord they have a bunch of other like smaller categories that they do for fun and I think they do and did a no no dismantle percent right nice I only didn't understand yeah now you gotta now you gotta raise them beat him
