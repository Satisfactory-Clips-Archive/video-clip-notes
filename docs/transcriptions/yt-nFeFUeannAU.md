> we also I haven't gotten the latest update on this, but you know we talked about early on that we might do a change with overclocking how overclocking works in the game that change will not happen in update six it will be something that we if we do something we do it further down the line we felt that we kind of needed more time to sort of evaluate that ourselves rather than just throwing it out to community, because the more we thought about it the more like questions we sort of had and, we felt like we should probably spend more time, thinking about it and like you know because it will have quite a significant impact on

> that part of the game if we do change the overclocking system so, yeah we want to spend more time on that essentially so that also won't happen for update 6. and we don't know if it will happen you know like maybe we need to solve it in a different way the the thing with the overclocking change was that there was a couple of things that we wanted to change in the game, one thing that we wanted to make like slugs more, what's the word like valuable in a sense because I think a lot of people don't overclock because they realize that like I but I need the power though so like it's not really efficient to overclock in a lot of cases so a lot of people don't overclock for that case, a lot of people feel like they need to build so much more sort of you know because you if you build you know if you build a hundred machines set them to one percent you're using so much less power than if you just built one machine that's not really how we intended the game to be played I know that like I'm not I know I realized that you know it's a kind of extreme way to abuse the game and I don't think anybody actually does it that way but it's still like a problem like design wise that doesn't make sense, there's also like the fact that not people understand not a lot of people understand how overclocking works, so there's also a little bit of like a mental model issue there mental model model issue, what do people expect versus what actually happens and, there's also there's one more thing there's one more reason I can't remember and like the the feeling we got like when we were looking to these different issues is like we can solve a lot of them by changing how overclocking works but then we realized like but maybe changing how overclocking works isn't the best solution because it also causes a lot of other problems, so we'll see but we also got like I think we got a lot of good feedback from community when we did talk about this there's been a lot of really good threads on like where people like don't change it please or please change it or why and etc, I think mark knows better I mean obviously mark knows better because he's the one who's actually making the decision the last time I spoke to him about it we we were also thinking of going like maybe doing the the linear thing isn't the best way to do it maybe we should think about changing a little bit of maybe we retain the exponential growth but maybe change the the curve a little bit, you know maybe underclocking works differently than overclocking you know stuff that we're still evaluating essentially is what I'm trying to say, we haven't committed on any idea at the moment and I don't think we will for quite some time because we need to spend more time with it and try it out ourselves first yeah long story short no overclocking in update sticks but in the future possibly
