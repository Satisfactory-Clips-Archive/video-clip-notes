### Transcript

> so so this is this is we we got a line working you guys like it's it's working, but one aspect that it's pretty big part of this game is is all these numbers that you see like all the the different ratios and like so so right now we're not really like, meeting the requirements per se, because like if you if you keep trickling down the line you're gonna notice that like not all machines are are performing enough to be able to like get to the point where we're actually gonna get two modular frames for a minute, yeah that's if you go back to the thing which one the back of the assembler the modular frames yeah yeah so that's that's two modular frames per minute assuming that you're also feeding on the left-hand side there yeah three reinforced iron posts per minute and 12 iron rods per minute exactly and so you need to meet those requirements in order to get the two mods of the frames out on the other side yes, so so like if we were to like look back at this this whole production line like stand up here maybe like there are a few problems with it right the one of the major problems being that like we're only producing 40 screws per minute but we need i think it's 60 to like meet the requirements you see here it's even like stops, because it's not fitting up fast enough so like when it's finished a cycle it's waiting for the next one so you can see we're at 69 efficiency on this this bad boy right here which is it's just not a hundred we kind of want to go for a hundred which is not something not 100 you don't have yeah you don't have to go 100 to like get through this game but if you care about the numbers and you want to like you know get as efficient as possible you want to reach that number so we're not producing enough screws we're also not producing enough plates, because we need 30, sorry this one is producing 20 per minute but this one requires 30 per minute so we're like almost there, so that brings us two to a few tricks feature yeah yeah that you can utilize so one way to like solve this problem that we have specifically if you if you do the math you can notice like we need we need 60 but we're only producing 40. so if we were to like bump this up by a third or, just like if we wanted to produce 20 more then we would have enough so there's a neat little feature in this game it's called overlapping sorry yeah half so this is a neat feature in this game where you can overclock machines at the cost of power, so the slug that we found we can actually convert that these slugs are a bit special i don't know the exact lore behind these looks but they're like magical or something, and they can produce power shards, so let's make two power shards and what we can do is we can plug these power shards into the machines and then we can overclock them so we can overclock it to 150 clock speed and that will give us 30 iron plates per minute which is which matches what this machine requires right the downside of that or like the i guess the the law of equivalent exchange is that we all now require 45 iron mingles per minute so also the input also input requirements also increase, and right now we're feeding it 30. which is not enough so we need like a little bit more exactly, we could just overclock this machine and be like oh job's done, but we can also do a little bit of math and like split a little bit of what a little bit of mullet split these lines a little bit, so if we use a splitter here because if if if you know the max output of these smelters is 30 per minute so we and we want to get to 45 right did you guys know there's a calculator in the game by the way did you guys know if you divide 30 by half you get 15. 13 45 oh my god oh my lord so what we can do is we can take the output of one machine and split that and then use a merger put it here wait there's the output there you go all right and then combine these two to one merger so now the theoretical rate of that conveyor belt is 45 iron ingots per minute which matches what that constructor requires, and the right now it's not actually accurate because the the machine isn't actually like balancing it out but it will so like right now we also get 15 ingots like three so to speak, which we can distribute somewhere else if we want to so let's take a look at the rest of the line here, let's check the screws for instance god that that belt is annoying me so we need 60 screws per minute to to fill up this one and this one is only producing 40. same thing there if we increase it by 1.5 we get 60 per minute so now we're producing 60 screws per minute which now requires 15 iron rods per minute and wouldn't you know yeah 1500 exactly what a regular constructor that's producing iron rods is outputting so now we're actually matching this one that previously was overproducing, it's matching this one just need to, hook it up i think you've not hooked up one oh yeah yeah yeah and the thing about the con the the this one is that it doesn't require more than 15. and if you remember from here when we split this from 30 to 215 lines we get one line extra here of 15. it's all perfectly balanced so it just balances out magic magic, the the one thing that we're not going to talk about is this last line is is same thing here like this one needs 15 per minute it's actually been fed 30. we don't really need to feed it 30 we can actually balance this out as well we're not really using it for anything right now though so like you can just keep feeding it yeah exactly, but you kind of see like the the the whole thing why i brought this up is like now we're subtly utilizing these lines a bit better one thing i also failed to do here is i am i'm getting a line of 120 per minute and dividing that into three which is a kind of like weird ratio the correct ratio is if i divide this by four we will get, 30 this one needs 30 per minute so we can divide 120 by four you have four constructors running with 30 yeah iron ore or rather if you look at this from this perspective you get you have a line of of 120 and one machine requires 30 per minute so we can do 120 divided by 30 that will tell us 4 which is the amount of like smelters that this line can supply at 100 efficiency so if we want to be you know extra pedantic and like proper we can split this line into four and if we want to load balance it which is another step to this we also want to do in in comparison to the manifold splitting that it before where we had one line that fed into multiple smelters we can also do a regular split where we split it evenly so we split it first in half so we get 60 60 and then split those into half so we get 30 out of those, and then we get it and so like this side of things like you know if you if you don't want to do the math and you don't want to go through this optimization you know you really don't have to the other thing is maybe you want to do some optimization but not everything completely perfect and running 100 you can do that too you know it's it's really up to you to what degree you want to like nerd out over the game you know
