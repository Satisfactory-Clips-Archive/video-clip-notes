> as I said we're going to fixable radiation keeping you a Max radiation after recycling something, I don't know I think it is on the computer side I think the tricky thing with that bug is that we haven't been able to easily reproduce it when we're trying to fix it, so unless it's it's already been pretty well established on that ticket for that bug, if you can give us as much information on how to reproduce it as possible, then then go for it because I know that we've tried to look into that maybe it's not that specific bug but like I recognize the bug itself and I know that whenever the program is to try to fix that bug they've never been able to reproduce it properly so they can like actually check into what actually is causing the issue, so save files you know as much info as you can like if you have steps even you know pretend that we're five years old you know the better that the the more info the better really
