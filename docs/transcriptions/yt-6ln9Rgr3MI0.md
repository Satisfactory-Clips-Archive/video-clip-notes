> for sure jace you should do group iron man with some coffee stainers you know i don't really want to like i don't want to like get coffee stainers to have to spend more time with me than they have to you know what i mean i feel bad for them um but i but i was thinking of doing like group iron man with a couple friends i've got some friends who are interested so i'm i'm kind of curious about wait what is what is that group iron man so that's runescape yeah okay i i thought like instead of a runescape thing but like how many people at the office play runescape no one yeah so that's the other issue is that no one actually wants to play and iron man iron man is not really a mode for new people either so like you need people who are kind of experienced with the game to jump in with yeah so it's gonna try hard it's probably not gonna happen
