> and it changes your exploration plan if so what can you tell us about it the the thing I can tell you about it is is that we have plans to change the spiral coast, and that is like the top northern part of the map and this is something that we plan to do for a long time, and I actually have I actually have a bit of news here okay this is going to upset a lot of people so a couple of people ask me later earlier if the resource notes will change in the spiral coast and they they in fact will dun dun dun which is really which is actually surprising to me which which should tell you how big of a change this is actually going to be because I don't think we've ever done that before we've actually moved resource notes like that so big gasp yeah so, yeah just dropping that bomb right on you 10 minutes before the stream ends uninstalled for sure you know we still don't but like don't fret we still don't know when the change this bile goes will come out, and when it comes to like map changes in particular we are

> we're we're trying to be very upfront as to like what the changes are the fact that like you know this should be telling that by the fact that we don't put out road maps right we don't tell you like this is this is what's planned for the game because it might change but we have put out a road map as to like what map changes are coming to the game because we think that that's actually a really important information for you guys, so when we get closer to releasing the world changes I'm sure that we will put out a lot of content to give you guys information as like what exactly is changing so you can plan ahead sort of, for the changes, but I get I guess the only information that we have right now currently is that just get your out of northern coast or whatever it's called right now

> because that biome will change plan ahead equals panic exactly, but that is that is surprising I don't think we've ever intentionally moved nodes before, because we have a couple of places where like we've rebuilt there's been one node I think that we moved and that was the the like crater one in dune desert so that's gonna be interesting oh great I have nothing important there only my entire nuclear power setup yeah but we will give you guys more news when we actually you know have a a plan to release something tied to the the world changes which probably might not be I don't know I don't know when that will happen
