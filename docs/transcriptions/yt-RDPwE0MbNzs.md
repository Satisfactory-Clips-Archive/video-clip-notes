> what's your stance on terraforming and do you plan for update 809 my stance I'll give you my stance on terraforming right now are you ready I don't like it well the, terraforming as a feature I think is an interesting feature in games I don't think our game needs terraforming, I don't think we can add terraforming to our game, I don't think I don't think you all the same terraforming in satisfactory I'm pretty confident in that, but- I genuinely don't think our game needs it like- I made a video about this people made fun of me like what our game is and game isn't right but like, one of the points that I made was like just because you can imagine a good feature right in a game and I think like if we could imagine satisfactory and there was terraforming it would maybe be a better game right it would maybe be a better game but just because like there is a feature you can add to your game that would make your game better that doesn't mean you have to add the feature and it also doesn't mean you're actually lacking something, because there's a million things that your game can be like a million there's an infinite number of things in fact not even a million a billion maybe even a trillion things that can be in your game, so and it's really really easy to see things that are like hey this could be cool and so terraforming is one of those, terraforming could absolutely be cool it might cause more headaches than it's worth, techno technically speaking- I don't see how it will be possible at this point and design wise I don't think the game needs it I don't think it needs it it would be so much work for something that probably isn't needed yeah if we could snap our fingers and it'd be in the game and all the user experience issues and the knock-on effects of adding terraforming could be solved maybe maybe it would be good but yeah could add map editing instead I think map editing would be, more doable than terraforming but- I don't know what the plan is for I don't know if there's going to be any map editing maybe maybe like some ability to expose map editing for mods or something who knows maybe that could be a thing in the future I'm spitballing ideas I'm not saying we're doing it
