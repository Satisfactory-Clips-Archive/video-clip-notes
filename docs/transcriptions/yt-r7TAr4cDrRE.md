> maybe you already answered this question but will you implement some of the mods that are out there such as alternate power for example more naturalizability so when it comes to mods in general, I would like to say I'm not 100 sure if this is true or not but I would like to say that maybe 95 of all the mods that are out there are like ideas that we've had at some point, and like are on like mark's little like idea board or whatever, or someone's idea board that brought up, because you know we've had a long time thinking about this game and we've had a long time you know you know we've had people literally their whole day just sitting thinking about like what can we add to this game all day, so like very rarely are like mods surprises to us it's like oh that's a cool idea sometimes it does happen, but as to like so when we see mods we really go like oh that's a cool thing we should add to the game it's more often than like oh somebody implemented this thing that we thought about before I wonder how it works and then we can like sort of use that as part of like our sort of guidance system if you will to be like that was a cool direction and a lot of people like that mod so maybe that confirms our bias in terms of like that was a good idea we should still pursue it, or sometimes it's like something completely out of blue is like oh that's a cool thing I haven't thought about that but, but as to like as if we look at mods necessarily and like try to implement them doesn't really happen too often I think it's more like a guideline if anything just to like confirm, you know if if we're on the right track with certain ideas or not and it's nice to see sometimes I think market said specifically some he's seen some mods where a lot of people really like some models like that's cool that's good to hear because I was kind of nervous about doing this specific thing I can't remember exactly what it was but that you know tells the tale that we're on the right track here
