> severity so here you can see a QA post by emus posted three years ago about the Blade Runners being in the wrong orientation in hypertubes and I believe that's still an issue to this day and, yeah that's been that's just been there for three years and it hasn't been fixed yet now the reason this is not a severe issue it doesn't break the game it is a little janky but and we do intend on fixing it but right now there's more important things for us to focus on and that's just kind of what we do so if a bug is deemed less severe than other bugs or features then it may just be push lower and lower on priority and it just takes a while before we get around to it instead we just focus on more severe and game breaking bugs another thing that affects the priority of bugs
