> can the power lines be partially dangled from a power pylon rather than through the middle of it so zip lining is more smooth, so this is this is one of those examples right where it's like you get a suggestion but like what's the problem and the problem is it would be really sick if you could just hold on to the zipline and just keep going yeah between polls one way or another maybe it dangles like you're suggesting maybe some other means I don't know I think it would be a really good idea personally especially since we've like given the Sprint ability on Ziplines to me personally I think it would make, sense for you to zip through power poles one way or another I'm not sure how we would do it yeah that would be sick or make it so that like if you hit a power pole you will sort of like glide through it and then the Collision box with like the zip line will be like oh there's another power line here it'll like catch on again I'm not sure if that actually is doable but you get the drift like yeah it's a sort of automating a little bit better so it's easier to stick stick to things but I'll have to just tell you like I mean QA is your friend go to the QA site leave your suggestions right there I'm happy to hear them here and we can talk and hang out together but you got to put them on the QA side too that's where it matters the most yes for sure
