> have any of you been able to open andro say pre-screws yet, yes I mean we're using some we we have like a collection of save files that we've gotten from community that we use as like, stress testing save files, we have like a server that runs every night that place plays the game by itself so it flies through like the environment and loads up a save file flies through the environment loads up a new one flies through and it reports back like what the frame rate was like in different areas and stuff like that and I believe we're using andrews for a bit of that testing
