> so it, roger how many people, are translating brazilian portuguese I don't know the exact number but I think it's five or or ten at least because we have some people that come and go and some were more active than others and I remember flavio bonacardi which was crazy spy I think on squad he translated a lot of strings and I didn't approve it then now yet so I still have work to do and we have another three guys that was very active I can't remember the names of them now but I translated a lot of strings and most of most of them I had help from from others because we we chatted a lot about which term is right which terms better because like like the example xenos aqua in portuguese brazilian we don't have a word that translates the this thing so we have, we had a translation which was added by in lingu by thais I think and that that one fuming which is sounded very weird for us because it's it's the the join you join two words which is full min which is like eliminate alien which don't doesn't sound very great for us and I think the best was to stick with zeno zapper because it's interesting zeno means alien likes not say satan and it's it's very hard to to translate something like ah the thing that you use to kill aliens so we stick with we stick with the default translation yeah
