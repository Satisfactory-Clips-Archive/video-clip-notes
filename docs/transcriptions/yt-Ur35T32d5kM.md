### Transcript

> on a scale of 1 to 100 where do you estimate you are to 1.0 I can't I can't answer these questions all right the answer to when is 1.0 coming is later it's coming later and I can't say anything else I can't tell you when we'll tease it I can't tell you what scale from 1 to 100 I can't tell you 69 sure we'll go to 69. I can't wait until later yeah 69 missed opportunity true everyone here is better at this than I am can you just make up a random date you were accurate without date seven yeah but I always make a random date about the next thing that we're doing so right now it's we're talking about update ATM all right ATM all right so just white TM until it's here and then we'll talk about 1.0 TM it sounds like wait this sounds like a an element now, it is the, with the atomic number of 88 ATM if you mix that in with waitium you get one point opium okay wait hold up Adam atium ATM machine update ATM a 1.0 release is 100 11 teeth of October exactly April 1. can you imagine if we if we we should we should reveal dates on April 1st and then people would be like Ah that's not true and then just drop it what if like on April 2nd we made it right but then on April 1st student I made a stupid video going like one point I was gonna drop tomorrow and I was gonna be like okay good one and then it actually drops exactly update ATM can we draw money from our update ATM yeah three dates on the wiki for update eight all right I'll give you guys a date you guys I'll give you guys a date it's gonna be update it's gonna drop on you guys ready February 29th 2023 there it is there it is it's coming out February 29th look forward mark it on your calendar if you can huh that's right J is 10 per second yes can you get an ATM for sync tickets yeah and if you deposit your money to the bank you get like interest or something I just want another podcast episode to be honest maybe we can do that maybe we can arrange that and be our back appealing to my Congress person to add a new day yeah why is February weird it doesn't even have 30 days and then it changes what's going on what's going on isn't it because like in actual year is like 365 days and and then like six hours or something isn't that why an extra day gets added what if we just what if what if we just 0.26 is it okay well what if we just make the year 365.26 what if we just do that all right and then everyone at New Year's you have to like pull your thing back the the clock but then that's it you don't have to worry about February being weird I had a friend who was born on February 29th we're like born like one year apart and like by the time I was 30 they were like 11. it was weird it just they just kept skipping their birthday they're aging very slowly or make every day slightly longer right make every day slightly longer what if we just like redefine what a second is so that it's like point zero zero zero one of a second or something longer and then we don't even have to change anything we could have the same clocks we can do everything the same and no one would even notice yeah maybe we should just use Unix timestamps true foreign because we should measure time in a way that isn't dependent on being Earth yeah that is very earth-centric of us wow we're very, we just did use metric time trujo 1.0 would be on 29th of the second 2024 is there a 29th yeah I guess so 2024 I guess so right it is it is we have an opportunity we have an opportunity yeah right super minox yeah there's the there's the, there's there's those exceptions I knew that that was those weird exceptions if if a leap year is on a multiple of 100 it's not a leap year yeah right, and if it's a multiple of 400 it's not a leap years does that mean does that mean year 2000 was not a leap year it was year 2008 leap year it is a leap year what wait you 2000 was a leap year but 1900 was not okay this is a rabbit hole wrong stream anyway if you didn't watch his JS do math no my math is right it just doesn't make sense I don't know it's confusing it's confusing ten plus zero because 100. exactly good one woodmaster, let's just make it up as they go along pixel yeah maybe while you're archiving this clip I didn't do anything yo it's not my fault it's confusing one two thousand is a multiple of 100 and 400. so it shouldn't be a leap year but it was every four years not every 100. all but every 400. okay I see so it's every every four years and every 400 years is a leap year but not every 100 unless it's a 400. okay makes sense makes sense makes sense but 2000 is a multiple of four thousand you made 400. all right what in the Andrew hell did I walk into you've been here all along Ruby no don't play it off like this
