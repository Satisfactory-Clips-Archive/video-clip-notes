### Transcript

> Will there be an NDA?
> There will be an NDA but it'll be a soft NDA,
> and what that means is we just request 
> that you do not share anything online,
> any information, any screenshots, any footage,
> don't stream anything,
> and the reason for that is the game
> is just not done yet.
> We would prefer to work with you improve the game
> and then show the game off to everyone a little later on.
> When this changes, when the NDA changes,
> we're gonna make that publicly available
> we're gonna tell everyone, so hopefully,
> please keep it under wraps and
> then we can show the world later.
