> update seven this year we haven't even released update six you guys are so needy like oh it's update sixes now but I want update seven now we don't know what's happening after update six honestly no it's a seven just go straight to 1.0 that is possible might not happen a while though but you never know I mean I we don't know that's the thing right we don't know what we need to you know because the the main thing for us really is that it's very valuable for us to push stuff in in like in segments because we get so much good feedback and you guys are so much like it's it's okay this always sounds like a cop-out whenever gamedev saved this but it's there's no getting around it but like having players test your game is so much like more much more in performance not performant so much more it's so much better than testing internally not that we don't do testing because we do do testing you guys you guys have no idea how [ __ ] broken this game can be, like you guys think you have it bad you guys have no idea, but but like if you just do the math right when when we launch an update I think during the weekend we have how many was it last time damn it I haven't I usually have a number for this but like okay say that like during a weekend say that a hundred thousand people play the game right you know so let's quick maths here okay if if a hundred thousand people play the game for a weekend let's say you play eight hours each day so 100 000 people times 16 is a million 600 000 right hours played okay let's say that we hire a qa person to to do nothing but like play the game, which is by the way not the only thing you do when you're doing qa you're doing other things as well but so we divide this by eight hours a day right that's 200 000 days to amount to a weekend, so like okay how many people do you hire to be able to like fit the same like we can never amount to the same amount of like testing that happens which is like I you know- I certainly believe it when when big game devs say like run into like huge it bugs I'm not saying the name of the company but I doubt totally believe this that they say like we did testing and we never run into this issue and a lot of people aren't into it I totally believe that because that is something that we happens to us, and it's just that's just how it works like there's no getting around like releasing a game is nev like not you can never prepare enough like if anything whenever like, like call of duty games are released and they are like as bugless as they are that should tell you how much time is spent on keyway, you know so so, I don't know why this became a rant but but, what was the whole point of this by the way I just [ __ ] one of those tangents- I just think it's interesting I don't think a lot of people realize just how big of a like you can how [ __ ] expensive it is to do testing on the same scale as like releasing a game I think I don't think people, feedback yeah so feedback is really good feedback is really good because we get a lot of testing we can find issues that we we weren't able to like find even if we spent an entire year play testing, and, and also like the you know since we're early access we're also taking advantage of that we're taking advantage of the fact that the game isn't finished we can listen to feedback because it oftentimes if you release a game and you say like it's done and then people are like this thing is broken like it's hard to like kind of fix for that because there might be people that think this thing is broken might be a lot of people to think no it's not so we really have a good like opportunity to like shape the game

> to be you know sort of what is best for everyone, so basically tesla's something you pay for it in a sense yes, but also you know you're also getting, access to software early essentially and if you don't want to be a tester I mean I don't think I don't think necessarily we see it as you guys are tested like the people that bought it earned access, because we still we still see it as like a like like our game is supposed to be a product that you want to buy right I don't think we want to see it as like, you're buying in to play the game I think we still see it as like no you are buying a product like,

> there's a balance third of course but, we're products you're a product you're everyone's a product but, what I'm trying to say like it's very beneficial for us to release stuff so like is there gonna be an update seven is there I don't know like it depends on what we're working on what we have left if we feel like we want feedback on stuff because it might not be you know feature-wise something we need feedback on it might be more like if we do if we release like a new version of servers or something like that that we want to test and that's going to happen incrementally anyways so we'll see we'll see what happens I don't know I'm I'm really curious what will happen after update six I'm I'm I'm cautiously positive because it is it is like this this period has been kind of different for me too like both how we communicate this because it is different for us doing this way so release not use this year I doubt it who knows maybe we'll [ __ ] pull through I also don't know how much we have left
