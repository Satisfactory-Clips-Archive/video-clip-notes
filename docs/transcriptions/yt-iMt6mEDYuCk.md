### Transcript

> okay so what okay so what happens now if if a vehicle shows up to a truck station that receives fuel but there's not enough fuel there the the vehicle will then wait until it has enough fuel so as to guarantee that it can complete the entire cycle right the entire route but while it's waiting there what if another truck shows up does it just slam into it who knows well so right now uh my understanding is rasmus is working on a q system we don't actually have a concrete answer on this yet but uh there is a we have some ideas on how to fix that and and make some sort of queuing system so that um basically uh yeah your vehicles won't sort of like charge into each other um even even if they're on different paths as well so that will even uh handle separate paths using the same truck station there's that too that's pretty impressive actually yeah so yeah yeah so we'll see how it goes that's the intention right now maybe it doesn't work out right and then and then who knows we'll have to solve that you know across that burn that bridge when it comes to it right hell yeah
