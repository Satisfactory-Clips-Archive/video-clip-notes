> let's grab the conveyor belt down the
> bottom I've got a hot bar and I've got
> the conveyor belt on three so I just
> press three I grabbed that there and I
> place it in here and we get a conveyor
> belt and all the iron ore just spilling
> out Wow exciting okay cool so now this
> is a smelter and in the smell - we need
> to smelt or into ingots and we have to
> choose a recipe because not always
> smells can do more than just iron ingots
> they can only just do that here in this
> example so I'm just gonna click that
> recipe and it shows that it needs iron
> ore it'll turn it into iron ingots but
> nothing's happening in fact it's not
> even taking anything in why oh because
> of power fancy that it needs power Oh
> didn't see that coming
> all right so let's hook it up to the
> biomass burner well I can't seem to make
> a power line that's because buildings I
> only have one attachment point so we
> have to get rid of that and see now I
> can connect again but you can see that
> there's like this big power pole
> hologram here I look at the ground it's
> there as well and what that'll do is
> it'll build a power pole and connect it
> with the power line and the cool thing
> about power poles is they are up to four
> connections this one does and so from
> here I could just build power line
> to the minor and then another one out to
> the smelter and now the smelter is
> working one thing to consider though is
> that there's only one more output on
> this power pole so what I like to do is
> I like to just build out another power
> pole so now that one's full but we have
> three more there so we might as well
> just hook everything up I guess for now
> now that we've talked about power poles
> I have to drag one more out here put one
> on that one and I have a building over
> here as well
