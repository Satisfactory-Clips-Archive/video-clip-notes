> why not just replace foundation grooves with a single object, not impossible, not not impossible we haven't like figured everything out yet with that because it's been a little bit of an issue that like adding more and more foundations just makes the menu very very cluttered I know that some people are like okay with that but I don't it it's not great having like a menu is just like a bajillion things I get overwhelmed immensely when I see that, I was gonna say so yeah, now that we've implemented that like e thing where like you get that context sensitive square wheel thing, it's possible that because because I've seen a lot of people play the game in the way where they pick one of each item in the hot bar and then just like sw turn the hot bar and then switch to that thing and it's I guess it's a little bit of like a preference thing there like people if people like it or not doing it that way so I'm not sure if that means that we're gonna switch that in completely but now that we tried it out and see how people think about it maybe that like helps us in the decision making of like what route we take there if we make it so that foundations maybe are more generic and you just pick one and then you pick the size on whatever in the scroll wheel or something like that I'm not quite sure I think that's up to our ui artist to like kind of like grab your feedback so if you have any feedback on that please make sure to post on the qa site cannot stress how useful the keyway site is for that kind of shiz
