> can we experience the story with or the existing 500 hour factor oh do you have to start from scratch so that's an interesting uh question the thing is i'm not 100 sure i think in the past i think we've said that we want to make it so that you can still do it but i i i genuinely don't know i i genuinely don't know if anyone actually knows for sure just yet because we we have to see we have to see like what the best way to implement the story is you know um and if i don't know i don't know if that means folks will have to start again from scratch to get to get the most out of it or not but yeah i mean i want to say hopefully not but at the same time i think that even though that's a major inconvenience uh i think we should do what is best for the game even if that you know even if that sort of screws some people over uh because the game is what lives on forever you know uh but we'll sort of see that's that's just my opinion on that
