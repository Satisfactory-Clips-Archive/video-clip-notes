> it yeah has the decision to press on to 1.0 recently been prompted at least in part by financials my impression was you folks did like experimenting with updates before 1.0 and there were updates planned but ultimately shelved okay so that's a pretty interesting impression i'm not sure what gave you that impression but i get the feeling that maybe you're not alone like maybe we've given that impression somehow so i figure i'll just talk about it anyway and i'll clear the air there actually kind of was a little bit of a shift uh to focus on 1.0 but it wasn't prompted by sales or anything like that like we're doing great you guys um thank you the prompt was mostly like well we got to do update four now uh and after update four it's gonna be update five and in order to really plan what we should do in those we need some idea of what the end goal is gonna be so we really just started focusing more on 1.0 uh as a means of having some kind of direction so that we weren't shooting in the dark basically and that's pretty much it and we have a pretty good idea of what that is now we're still always refining it but uh yeah we really want to go for it because you know we're an early access game and we feel that it's it's our responsibility to get out of early access we need to we need to finish the game and and give you the experience that we wanted right and that doesn't mean development stops after 1.0 you know we could still add stuff maybe i'm not saying we will but we've always alluded to the fact that we probably would add more yeah we still want to we kind of want to get out of early access you know that doesn't mean you know we're not cutting things out to get there to rush to get in we're clearly not rushing you guys we're so slow with our updates we're not rushing we we sit back and we take an honest look at okay what are we doing what do we want what do we consider a good finished 1.0 game and then we're gonna work towards that but that shift did kind of happen uh a few months ago and you know the fact that you brought up this question i guess it shows in some in somehow and that's really interesting to me so
