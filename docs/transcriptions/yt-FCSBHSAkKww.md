> problem with the resource scanner slightly off it doesn't do elevation of the node there i'm trying to think i think we're going to revisit that at some point, because there's another issue with the the reese's gun not the reason the resource scanner, sorry i'm thinking of the the other thing the the resource no wait which one is which again the one that pings is the resource scanner i think internally and then we have the item scanner thing which is called something else because one of them is called something in the game but it's internally called something else i think resource scanner is the one that pings, , object scanner is it called scanner is the one yeah so yeah yeah yeah so so, i think the the node thing where it pings and it's like not the same elevation i think that's something that comes in the world that's resource scanners oh god i'm so confused yeah like yeah but that the resource scanner that's one there's two problems okay i'm describing here one problem is that the the the ping for the nodes, sometimes isn't correct that's something that's going to be fixed in the world update because i believe that it's just visually incorrect so like that's going to be fixed in the world update when the nodes are like rendering properly and then we have a bug with the object scanner where it keeps pinging objects you already picked up and that's something that we're gonna fix at some point i started working on that fix and it was kind of tricky
