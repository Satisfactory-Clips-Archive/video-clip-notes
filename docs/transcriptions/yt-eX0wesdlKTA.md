> so yeah yeah engine upgrade good stuff let's talk about that for a second so if you don't know we've done this before okay if you're new to the scene and you haven't been with us with this journey that is the engine upgrade update that comes every now and then again like how many times have we done that like maybe two three times, , maybe more i'm not sure yeah maybe so so the we the reason why we're doing it is because we want to, we have updated the engine a version from 424 to toward 426 or even 4525 before whatever we updated the engine to 426 remember yeah and that is that is along with like the stuff that's going on with update 5 so we quit kind of like we needed the engine upgrade for update 5 stuff but we're going to put out the the endographic first to you on experimental just because we don't want to like put that out there on the release of up to 5 because it's probably going to be a ton of like weird issues whenever we do these like updates to the engine sometimes things that have worked before, we get bugs from those and like there are issues with maybe how we've we've because we've done some like changes to the engine itself so sometimes those changes are like reintroduced by epic sometimes we have to redo the changes that we've done because they've changed like a rendering pipeline or something like that, so so that can introduce weird issues that previously didn't exist and that can happen so there are no like new features in the engine upgrade so to speak like there's no gameplay changes, it's just that the game may in some instances depending on your hardware and like your your current setup you may get some like optimization improvements, we have updated the the rendering system for the conveyor belts so that might work a little bit better if you were having crashes with that maybe that will be resolved and yeah there's not a lot of bug fixes there's maybe like a few tweaks in there too
