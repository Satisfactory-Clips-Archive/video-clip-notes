> usually I make it to about tier five and my brain starts to malfunction with all that I have to keep in mind so suggestions help me out yeah profit okay I have a tip right because I'm kind of the same right when things get too confusing for my brain it just shuts down all right so my tip is don't worry about it don't keep everything in your mind except that either you will either keep everything in your mind get bogged down then quit again or just go like ah it I'm just gonna like I'm just gonna make a thing today and I'm just gonna go and do some power and then you just do it it doesn't matter if it's not perfect doesn't matter if it doesn't look good it doesn't matter if there was another recipe you could have used to get more power don't worry about it just go and make power and then and then that's it and then, chill out afterwards that's it and now you made Power great job at your plans and paper you can write lists too yeah that's a pretty good idea because then you don't have to keep it in your head right you don't have to worry about that too much you feel like a visual thing you can look at that's good that right there Jace is why we have so many unfinished projects yeah I mean- I know the I know the struggle I know the struggle you just need to empty your brain and stuff and just do just do what you can and then like maybe it's everything you hoped and dreamed of maybe it's not at least you did it

> so like that's like like, I like- I made, my aluminum build recently for the first time and I was like super kind of like oh God because oh man when I was trying to like get like a perfectly efficient like Elementium Factory I was like freaking out I could not make it happen and so I just I just I just changed my mind I was like it I'm not gonna try and make it perfect I'm just gonna build four of these buildings and they'll produce what they can produce and actually smashed it out in just an afternoon or an evening it's pretty good how do you empty brain I don't know I don't know just choose one thing you want to do don't question it don't get too bogged down by it don't worry if it's inefficient it doesn't matter if the conveyor belts aren't quite you know if there's like gaps in it or if they're backing up it doesn't matter it's better than not doing anything you can always fix it later it's fine and maxing is where planning never ends yeah it is really satisfying when you make something that's like perfectly min max though it does feel really good it's so bugged down that, start hating how I lay everything out and then always quit it through five yeah just don't hate how you lay everything out just accept you saw you saw the you saw the spaghetti in the community highlights earlier today they made it to tier eight you don't have to do everything right it doesn't matter if you're layout because they're they're layout was chaos it was absolute chaos and they've got the tier eight it's okay foreign it's chaos Jace the war master of Chaos no min max math doesn't work with your artist's brain so I just focus on building neat looking things yeah I think people like me who can't make things that look good or min max but you just build just build hashtag just build at this rate coffee stain would make more spaghetti than hunts hey hey it's not us that's making the spaghetti you you're making the spaghetti you guys have made more spaghetti than Heinz #just build this build guys you are the spaghetti enablers if it's if it's look if it's a choice between spaghetti or no building and no progress look I mean you have to just take the spaghetti don't regret spaghett nice
