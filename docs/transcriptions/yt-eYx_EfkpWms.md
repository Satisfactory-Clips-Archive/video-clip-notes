> a lot of people asking about are there gonna be these new things needs new things in update five well you know what you know I hear pipe mk3 conveyors mk six et cetera et cetera et cetera various things are they coming update five you'll have to just wait and see I'm not about to blow the load now okay I'm not about to just give everyone all the information of update 5 right now we will drip feed it slowly over time and, yes to be a huge addition like drones you'll you'll have to wait and see you guys I'm not gonna spoil update 5 stuff we'll tell you slowly over time, one of the one of the things that holds back some information as well is that you know whenever we try to do something if it's a teaser we don't necessarily want all the you know information to go out we sort of just want to tease and start getting sort of discussion and get some engagement going get people hyped maybe right but then there's also like the other kind of videos that we can do which are more informative where we give like hard details about what's going on, and sometimes the bottleneck with making these videos is also just it can be one of two things one maybe we don't have all the facts concrete just yet so we don't want to make a video where we can give all that information the other thing is that maybe we know what we're doing yet but we don't have like finalized assets and we don't really want to start making teaser videos showing off features that are like not really in a presentable fashion, so there's a few things that we would like to sort of start sharing soon but maybe we just need to wait a little bit more for some assets to be ready, you know in a way that we can present them either as a teaser or as a informational video obviously it's okay if we you know I'm sure no one will mind if we show some stuff that is like not final final but whatever but, , you know we could say oh it's just working progress but usually those kind of videos I wouldn't mind doing if it's like an informational video because people are getting a lot of value from the information too but the other thing is you gotta realize is like the developers who work on these features want to make sure that they're presentable you know they've been working really hard on things and when they first unveil it they want it to look as good as it can so that's another reason why we sort of just hold off on some stuff but you know we'll try we'll try to start putting out info every week now that's actually kind of the plan so we'll see we're in a new season
