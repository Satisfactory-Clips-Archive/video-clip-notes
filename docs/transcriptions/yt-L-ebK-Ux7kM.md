> the next question that people ask is the overclocked MK3 minor output situation where if you, you know overclock the MK3 Miner there's actually no way to, output that much, resources from The Miner because there's no belts quick enough and there's only one output on the miner so do we have a solution planned the answer is yes we have a solution planned and it it does seem like we have decided on what we're doing however I'm not actually allowed to tell you what it is but no just know that we are aware of that issue and, we have as we've said in the past we do intend on addressing it and it does seem like now we know what we're doing to address it and that fix will you know it'll make its way to you guys eventually okay yeah just knowing it's underway yeah it's gonna happen so like we we've heard you guys we've taken a lot of, a lot of feedback and stuff and we seem to have, solutions for it now it sort of it sort of brings up the question of like what about, thank you because we're thinking the limits of conveyor belts throughput right and needing to up that people have you know a a sister issue with that is that, pipes still struggle right to to pipe through 600 cubic meters of fluid, and so I asked about that as well, do we you know what's the situation is it still the issue do we plan on fixing it whatever and it does look like we we still have an intention to, it seems like we're interested in trying to solve the technical issues around that to try and fix it, and that's where we're at on that right now so like you know I that might sound like an obvious solution but like there's another solution which is well if we just downscale, fluids, requirements then then like it will probably just work as it is but it looks like we're pretty interested in actually finding the technical issue in solving it so then hopefully that will be fine people still ask about MK3 miners every stream yeah I mean maybe they will but at the end of the day all I can do is let you know what I know and and I can't really do much more than that so I can't stop people asking the same questions you know if they if they just didn't hear they didn't hear so maybe we can put like a make a video about it or something at some point just to get it out in front of more people I think I think that's probably a good idea I really appreciate these follow-ups great I'm glad you liked it I'm glad you liked it so I'll I'll, make notes, I closed my notes I'm sorry but I'll make, notes for any more follow-up questions that we might come up with I'm not gonna follow up everything just some things that like if if maybe people actually do know at the office, but I don't know what it is or if I've forgotten or if nothing's changed in a while then I can follow up on certain things just add second output to buildings I mean there's many ways we can solve it Elder one, yeah you can stop them just ban them solved no that's not very good for the community
