> better blueprint snapping coming that's another bit of feedback that the team has heard a lot about, and another thing that they're taking into consideration and yeah I think I think there is probably going to be work done with that I can't say if it's going to happen or not because like who knows if like we sit down and do it and we go huh look there's all these issues with it and then like now what who knows but it is it is a bit of feedback that the team absolutely has like gotten from you guys, it's also feedback they've gotten like we we have gotten that feedback ourselves too like when we play internally like I'll play it and I told them like how the snapping is kind of annoying, I've gotten that from snow as well but yeah there's still there's still more work planned for for blueprints but we think that like it's still it's still really good like we are we are leaning on the Early Access thing quite a bit here because it is really good for us to put them out now because the feedback we can get from you guys on on how we should handle it design wise like what size should it be should there be multiple options what other features does it need like there is no amount of internal testing we can do that you guys will not like that that you guys that we could do that would make up for you guys playing the game for like three weeks there's there's not like there's no shot we can't even like you guys feedback is like way more valuable it's like too valuable so it's like we think that even as it is with some issues, we think it's in the long run gonna end up being better because we get better feedback sooner and and then we can make adjustments from there and and we think that even though it's maybe not completely perfect now you all are you like you'll still benefit from having the feature as it is right now than than not so
