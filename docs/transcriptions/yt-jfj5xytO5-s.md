> will there be mark's mark ii trains, no probably not we don't have any plans for any mark two things in the game just because it adds so much like extra work on on the models because we don't feel like just slapping on a goal good old mark ii like text on on a factory building it doesn't feel good we want to like it's got to fill juicy and do we have any mark to production we don't have it here right what was that production building we didn't have mark 2 production no we don't I guess the I mean there's like the miners and and yeah that's it because that just ups the speed but like yes I guess the intention would be just just update the speed if we had like a mark ii, constructor or something but yeah because it feels kind of weird design wise to to put that in yeah because that's kind of what the alt recipes are kind of filling that space design-wise that plus box as well exactly so and then and then let's just move it like pushing like moving the goal post right because then it's just like all right now I've got everything running on mark two constructors now I want mark three yeah like you'll never be satisfied
