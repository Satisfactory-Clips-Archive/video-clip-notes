> plans to add solar no um solar and wind power is something that we're not interested in adding the reason for that is because we think that all power generation in the game needs to come with sort of a trade-off and you need to be making some form of decision when it comes to power you know and the way we see it in our game is that having wind power and having solar power is just like infinite power essentially because there's no there's no nothing that's stopping you from just building you know an infinite amount of solar panels um or wind turbines for that matter either uh there's no like trade-off there and other people are like yeah but you can add like that they they don't get power during the night or like there's they get dusty or whatever you have to clean them and two things that we don't like about that is not having uh sun during the night is won't work because the days are 45 minutes long and the nights are five minutes long so like it's an insignificant amount of time where they won't be adding power the second one is if if we were to like have maintenance to factories and that's something that we hate we hate that idea uh just because satisfactory is supposed to be chill satisfactory is not supposed to be like um like the the one thing you maintain is power uh and balancing of power essentially in your factory and that's it we don't want you to like have to revisit old factory buildings and like i go back to certain areas to fix them up um chill has mutant spiders chill in the sense that like in the building aspect of the game okay um like when you're building factories we don't we want to be a chill experience we don't want that's why we don't want tower defense we want don't want you to feel like you have to like repair so it goes into that category the one thing that mark has pointed out that it kind of like is interested in is having maybe water turbines and stuff like that and like you're only able to place them on waterfalls maybe because then it becomes a resource thing where similar to the geothermal ones where you have a limited amount of space to place your water turbines and how you spend that space so a little bit into like that's more interesting but i also don't know if that's going to happen water power 50 confirmed sort of yeah but i don't know if it's gonna like it's an idea let me let me rephrase it because it's like it's an idea that we like but there are a ton of ideas that we like that we're not gonna do just because we don't have the time to do it or that we feel like it's a priority for the game so to speak like vr would be cool for the game we we would love that but we're never gonna do it we're never gonna develop that ourselves at least because we don't wanna spend time doing that um and we don't feel like it will add much to the game it will add much to the what is it like one percent of people on steam that own a vr headset or something like that um so it'll be great for them but like we always have to make decisions based on the grand scheme of things you know um so so
