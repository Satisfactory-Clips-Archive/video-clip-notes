> okay can you make it so we can use, can you make it so we can use closed conveyor belts to help with rendering performance it may be a small preview, so we have tried that, we've we've tested it like our our, technical artist, he's he's tried try that out and see like how much of a difference it makes I keep forgetting to check with him what the difference was like was it worth it like it might would it maybe be good for the game, I think, if anything we would add that as like a maybe as a kind of cosmetic to to pipeline or to conveyor belts for the people that really need it because it is tricky like it's not as easy to use and get like you don't see what's on belts and stuff like that, and yeah for rendering specifically but we also have a bunch of ideas on how to fix rendering issues in general, so like there's still a lot of stuff to fix before we get to the point where like do we get a lot of gain if we don't render items on belts and stuff like that, so we'll see what happens, but I know we have tried it so it's it's not something that we've you know it's not an idea that we've ignored or anything like that it's something that we've pursued
