### Transcript

> specifically what I do here is maybe
> better explained as world design or
> world building I like to sort of build
> more in layers so I first do okay what
> kind of landscape are we looking at like
> are we having a lot of mountainous area
> is it more flat lands is there a lot of
> water so erosion rivers etc so I'd go
> for the big stuff like cliffs and water
> and landscaping and then I figure out
> what kind of landscape material we need
> so then I do another passive painting
> and that usually also introduces more
> detail in the landscaping that I do and
> so I just go over an area layer by layer
> by layer and then eventually but last
