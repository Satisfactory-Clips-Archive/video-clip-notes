> is there ever going to be a satisfactory for mac or four-player mode I don't know what you mean by four-player mode because you can already play with four people but for mac, it's the same that goes for any platform that isn't windows so mac linux and consoles we don't really support them even though people are having success on linux anyway, for the same reason that we don't want to it takes time to support the other platforms whenever you do anything and we want to put maximize our effort into the to pushing the game forward, and then we can put it on to other platforms when we know what we're doing because you know there's still a lot of work that goes into rebalancing things and just creating new buildings that you know have always supposed to been there but we haven't done it yet so, we need to make sure we prioritize that stuff over the other platforms unfortunately
