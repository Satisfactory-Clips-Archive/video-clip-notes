### Transcript

> I hope to see you there Another thing that's probably worth mentioning is we mentioned it last week
on Twitter and on the social medias but maybe you missed it is that information about the save files going from update #2 -  which is what we are now into update #3 we previously said that we didn't know if your saves
would be even loadable in update #3 or if they *were* loadable, your factory would be broken and that you would have to fix it however one thing that we are very confident in now is that your save files should be loadable if they are loadable you are most likely going
to have to refactor your factory like if you have hardly anything in your factory
maybe you don't need to refactor it but if you've got a medium-sized to big
factory you are most likely going to have to refactor your factory
and fix it all up but your saves will load™ Should Load™©® if they don't please let us know *laughs* and back them up first. We'll see if we can make sure
that it works for everybody. Okay so the next thing is something that we
would love some help from you
