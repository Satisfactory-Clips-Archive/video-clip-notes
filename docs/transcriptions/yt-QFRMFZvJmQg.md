### Transcript

> all right so, let's talk a little bit about state of dev apart from from the many people play the game, something that people may have noticed today actually, when you booted up the game, and it's kind of tied into something we'll talk about later which is this thing if i can wait, oh whatever it's it's up here, fixmas what's happening with fixmas this year, so this is a bit awkward, so fixmas some people have seen that like fiction says triggered on on, i think both ea and experimental actually that like presents are coming down so that is that is last year's fixmas, that triggered, for some reason and it's kind of buggy for some people because it won't like actually trigger anything so if you played fixmas last year and you've unlocked everything then you have access to everything again right now and that's not a big deal but like for some people it's kind of like locking the the progression of fixmas from last year and there's no calendar and i don't think you can access the mam so it's a bit buggy and that's because we didn't anticipate that it would trigger today from last year, so we're gonna have to address that by putting out a patch today and that will kind of like, disable fixmas for people that are still on november 30th, which is a little bit of bummer but we we have some exciting news later down the line that we'll talk about when it comes to we will be we'll be talking a little bit about fixmas just a little later so i'm just going to leave you on a cliffhanger just so you guys know what's happening if stuff just like starts not fix messing up, don't be alarmed that's intended behavior, but yeah i mean this cliffhanger is only gonna be for like another 40 minutes and then we'll tell you what's happening okay so so it's not a big deal, so yeah it's it's brokenness right now the fixmas that you're seeing right now is last year christmas or facebook yeah but we'll get we'll get around to that
