### Transcript

> all right so uh let's talk a little bit about state of dev apart from from the many people play the game uh something that people may have noticed today actually um when you booted up the game um and it's kind of tied into something we'll talk about later which is this thing if i can wait uh oh whatever it's it's up here uh fixmas what's happening with fixmas this year um so this is a bit awkward um so fixmas some people have seen that like fiction says triggered on on uh i think both ea and experimental actually that like presents are coming down so that is that is last year's fixmas um that triggered uh for some reason and it's kind of buggy for some people because it won't like actually trigger anything so if you played fixmas last year and you've unlocked everything then you have access to everything again right now and that's not a big deal but like for some people it's kind of like locking the the progression of fixmas from last year and there's no calendar and i don't think you can access the mam so it's a bit buggy and that's because we didn't anticipate that it would trigger today from last year um so we're gonna have to address that by putting out a patch today and that will kind of like um disable fixmas for people that are still on november 30th uh which is a little bit of bummer but we we have some exciting news later down the line that we'll talk about when it comes to we will be we'll be talking a little bit about fixmas just a little later so i'm just going to leave you on a cliffhanger just so you guys know what's happening if stuff just like starts not fix messing up uh don't be alarmed that's intended behavior um but yeah i mean this cliffhanger is only gonna be for like another 40 minutes and then we'll tell you what's happening okay so so it's not a big deal um so yeah it's it's brokenness right now the fixmas that you're seeing right now is last year christmas or facebook yeah but we'll get we'll get around to that
