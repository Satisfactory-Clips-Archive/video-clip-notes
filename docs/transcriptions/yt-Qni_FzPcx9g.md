### Transcript

> somebody asked about mark two factory buildings and the we've said before we're not gonna have that would you like to elaborate on why that is mark yeah because they yeah probably most people know of this because they were either in the engine or just because they thought it was i mean it's not a bad idea because it kind of limits the object amount and especially in late game you need so many items that, it helps a lot to just have faster production potentially that way i scrapped them because i didn't feel like that was a good investment over time because if we want an mk2 constructor we probably want to make it look different somehow and that's again more work that we need to do so i would rather invest that time into trying to make the overclocking for example better or having different ways that we can amp up production in a similar fashion that is potentially both nicer to use and, more resource efficient from our side when we actually produce it and we have some solutions on that and we're actually gonna try to investigate that as well when the time arises but i've planned it in for 1.0 although not very specifically but it's something that i want to look at yeah but that's why we don't want to do the mk2s because it's just yeah it would be a lot of work to to keep the standards that we have for our production, for all those kind of new buildings yeah it's also like how how many buildings like would that mean every single building is a mark two like that's a lot of rework or not rework but like a lot of a lot of work yeah there's just generally better solutions like the overclocking or alternate recipes we could rethink that a bit as well if we really want to achieve that hmm
