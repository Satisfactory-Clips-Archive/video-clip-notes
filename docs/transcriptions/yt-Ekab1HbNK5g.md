### Transcript

> and to tell some news about the the nuclear PP overclocking sorry that's so funny PP, I'm five years old by the way yeah I didn't mention this but, one change that is coming in update seven is we're changing the water requirement for nuclear power plants so instead of requiring 300 Water they will require 240 probably I think it will be 240. 240 makes sense because it's like It lines up with the with the, water extractors and then if you overclock 240 you know you'll get 300 600 eventually so that's the number that I said in the video because I think that's the number we will change it to, but I, reserve the chance to change that number, in case Mark changes his mind last minute because you know he is a very that that boy changed his mind like we changed our clothes you know, but that's the number that we have in our heads right now so that that's the number that we're going with for now
