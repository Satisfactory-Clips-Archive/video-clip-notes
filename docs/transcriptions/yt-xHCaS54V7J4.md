> I need to, reposition things alrighty folks did I miss that of Dave nope it's happening right now right now actually that's a good point merch for folks March, there is thanks snoot and thanks Jace coupon codes for lizard doggo.com if you're interested in merch like this big doggo here Marius is my son, if you're interested in getting anything you should definitely check out lizard doggo.com now and use the codes I think they they run out the campaign ends tomorrow maybe you think codes are still active yeah heroic replicas they're they they run out I think on first of December I think they stop working so if you're if you've been oh in about a week or so okay great so if you're, been on the fence with merch, now's a great time to consider that I think one of them is like free global Shipping if you spend over a certain amount as well which has been, you know a pain point for some people when it comes to you know shipping costs can be rough, another thing is, heroic replicas has also gotten a bit better with, the shipping as well because they've got some some of the stock is actually within EU and stuff as well now so I think I think if I correct if I'm wrong here but I think, shipping should be better within EU or outside of us I guess, for some things too so you know if, if you've been on the fence check it out your video is slightly behind your audio is that the same for everyone else it should be fine, this is something that I've noticed on twitch sometimes if you just refresh, it sometimes it gets better yeah I think it might be your Twitch stories give it a refresh buddy, okay so that's, yeah merch has gotten a bit of an update there, also why do my my notes just fix it and what does that mean oh I know I meant to say fix Miss fixmest right it's a fixmest that's what I meant to say, we're doing fixmest again this year folks, and I'm actually gonna be releasing a video tomorrow that's going to cover our state of Dev stuff that we're talking about here so you guys are getting it early okay because we know stuff earlier so I'm gonna tell you now, and, and then when the video comes out tomorrow you all have to go there and you have to comment and say wow I had no idea this was coming incredible you have to say that right all right so we're going to talk about the state of stuff and I'll put a video out tomorrow and you have to be surprised okay so the first thing is going to be fixmest we're going to be starting on December 1st so that's in two days

> well look when you put it that way Matt and Ruby, yeah so fixmest is coming, first of December it's going to be active in two days it's going to be active on both the Early Access and the experimental versions of the game okay and as some of you might know Update 7 is on the Early Access, is on the experimental version right now and update sixes on the Early Access despite that, the fixmest changes will be going to both regardless so there'll be an update okay, in terms of what you know will there be new stuff that's actually going to be no new stuff in fixmest it's going to be the exact same fixmesters last year, reason being we're literally still working on update seven, and so time has been a bit tough it's been hard to, justify taking people off working on Update 7 and future stuff because we're working on future stuff too, to work on fixmest this year unfortunately but we know that people like it we think it's a fun seasonal event and we think that there's some people who might not have gotten everything from fixmest last year and this is a great opportunity to get it okay so it'll be the same fixmest but it'll be fun, and yeah should work on, should should kick into gear on the first of December, and I believe I believe everything works with blueprints, yeah I'm pretty sure that's been, tested and we'll see how it works, I'm not actually completely sure I can find out, I can hopefully guarantee that it would crash with blueprints we'll see I'm I don't know, but in terms of like whether things will work with blueprints I'm actually not sure I think they will I think the intention is that they will, yeah okay so that's the first part of state of Dev this is gonna be a fixmest the second part is Update 7 release date, it's with a heavy heart that, there's no time there's no time for update seven we're going straight to update eight I'm kidding, we're gonna we're gonna actually release it next week folks on Tuesday next week so December 6th is when we're gonna be moving it over from, experimental through Early Access and we'll hopefully have, our patch notes video to drop with that as well so we'll have something to look forward to we'll do a fun stream next week we'll get a patch notes video we'll get the release of update seven and everything should be good okay updated confirm yeah maybe maybe, beam fix all bugs fixed, I was told that it should be fine, yeah that, they're fixing the bugs so, should be good if you do have any bugs that you want fixed always go to QA site, questions on satisfactorygame.com and, let us know, birthday present nice different calendar pick at least I'm not sure what changes they'll be as far as I know it'll be just the same one because everyone's really really busy and so it's like either we roll with the same one or we don't have any fixmas you know the beams are broken just them beams okay well make sure you put it on the QA side folks and, we'll get fixing the beams satisfactory is a bug-free and completely stable game Jace 2022 yeah exactly, okay yeah I think that's pretty much state of Dev I don't think there's anything else to say I think that's it the bugs J's just some happy little accents yeah
