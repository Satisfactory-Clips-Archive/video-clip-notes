### Transcript

> say that again that's right God we watch by the way so Sidetrack a little bit but me and Jace had like a little lecture where, we talked to a bunch of community manager like students and, you know like we made the lecture like last we warned we weren't we made a stay back turn around we made the election last year and we used to like a snippet from the update 5 video and I got a little bit like oh remember those days yeah that video was really good it's like I don't know that might have been one of the best teams- I was like all the- I like all the all the crunch from that video just like disappeared from my mind when I saw it I was like oh that was so good good times yeah very proud of that peaked an update five piece Maybe but I but, maybe there's a bunch of really exciting things though coming yeah yep yep yep yep yep, well I look forward to doing another one we didn't get to obviously you know I wasn't really around in order to do, a passion to be developed me neither yeah I mean, yeah look forward to getting back on it I mean I told the story I think, I think I told it on stream where like we we probably would have made a patch notes video for update six if it weren't for the fact that the Boombox got like delayed and like we shifted around and like the video had worked on for the boombox got moved around, because originally the update six trailer was supposed to be the teaser video for the Boombox and it just kind of evolved into that because we found out that like or we feel that felt that it was less work doing that way, and honestly it was kind of because like it was the the most easiest like release video we've ever made, but yeah- I yeah because like all the videos like the patchless videos and the trailers and stuff like they're all a lot of work and it's it's really stressful on the people who who do those and make them to make them and sometimes it can be it can be a little tough sometimes right like because I know like after we'd get that video out right and then one week later we'll jump on a stream and people are like cool so yeah for update six and my brain immediately goes but I'm still recovering you know and the thought of doing another one is like at that point in time specifically is really tough on the brain, but you know I've been away from it for a while so I'm kind of pumped to do yeah honestly at this point yeah I miss making live action stuff, yeah yeah for sure and I think that's kind of what awakened within me when I when we watched that little clip we have so we did shoot something in February that we still haven't used for anything and I've got a couple ideas of how we can use that, yes
