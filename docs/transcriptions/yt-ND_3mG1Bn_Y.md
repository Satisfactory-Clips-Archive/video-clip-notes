> can we see the spreadsheet I don't think there's anything secret on that spreadsheet that you have right, it depends which one okay we'll see we did show we did share in the tools video that we put out, two a couple of weeks ago, there's a huge document it might not be factory layout document but there's like document about some of the decision making between the other features and stuff yeah I think chase in the video for the tools he showed some stuff so there was a snippet from the the spreadsheet that I have that keeps track of alternate recipe balance oh yeah that's the one yeah, a lot of people found this don't think that's up to date no it's it's from update five what was I mean it's updated I think oh okay, maybe four

> I think a lot of people find it interesting that like well a couple of notions I saw that people found interesting on that was that I'm going to bring it up on screen here, was that some of the like almost every alternate recipe has like a trade-off or like you know there's there's a goal with the alternative recipes I don't know if you can see them yeah whatever that's important

> so, so yeah that was the main thing I want to bring up here is like enhance zoom in I can't zoom in on a video, but, like essentially yeah if you're like each recipe flickers and the the iron rod screw steel raw steel screw wait what's it called casted screw like it's the easiest to build has less it requires less buildings less power has powerful output but it's got a bad input ratio for instance that's as an example of one of them, and and I guess that goes in for like almost all recipes that we make for the game even the basic ones right the basic ones are a bit different because these are specifically designed around these points which are their trade-offs right so we want them to have some downsides and some plus sides especially compared to each other and their base recipe for the base recipes what we're mostly trying to achieve is a progression between them because we know that players are generally gonna build one set up and then the next setup and then the next so what we're trying to do there more is trying to increase their knowledge on how to solve certain problems and kind of layer them on top of each other and then combine them in different ways so that one is more based on yeah the recipes need to get more complex over time and teach different parts of the game to the player well these are really all about trade-offs

> gotcha michael is all downsides I like that I like that, people have very strong opinions about certain, old recipes I think that kind of like makes it funny yeah I think the nicest thing to see there is that there is like still then disagreements about that yeah which is I think exactly what we want well we don't want people to fight over what is best of course but we want different people to see value in different things depending on their situation or perspective within the game my favorite old recipe is the portable miner one yeah what was that what was the goal with that one to allow it to allow it to be automated okay I figured I mean it's just nice to be able to do why not I guess I've crafted otherwise so many of them I guess and obviously it's yeah it's obviously worse than the main the main recipe right yeah but you can automate it so yeah I guess that's true bet you didn't think of that chat I certainly didn't
