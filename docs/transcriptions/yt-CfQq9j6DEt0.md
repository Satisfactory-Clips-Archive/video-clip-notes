> can there be an option when creating a new game to randomize what resources of and what purity appears at each note location that is always possible to do, that is something that we probably would introduce when we add more game modes to the game which I don't know when that will happen but, so probably some point before 1.0, because that's not impossible to add, what we can't add is like you know level randomization as in like procedural generated planet can't add that to the world and we can't have, terraforming because of the way we built the game
