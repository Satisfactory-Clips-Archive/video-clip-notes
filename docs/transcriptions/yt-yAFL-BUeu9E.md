> yeah will there be any visual map overlay of the blocks so uh there isn't going to so like in last week's video i talked about um that we had ideas for feedback but we want to see what people feel they need right and that's actually one example so one thing we thought of is like some kind of like visual representation over like what a like of like what a block is from from a signal or something like that and you know sort of like internally debug-wise we have stuff that kind of does that but we we just kind of want to get feedback from people first and then sort of see whether or not we actually do need that and if we do need something what do we actually need whether like whether like how should that visual representation be uh or maybe we don't actually need visual representation but maybe we need something else and and yeah we're just waiting to see what people say first and then we'll sort of figure it out from there but the idea of visual uh representations over blocks is something that we have considered yeah because like in our minds when we're releasing trains now in update five like they're not fully fully finished like we are expecting some feedback so we can keep working on them a little bit more and get them to that goody-goody state because there's a lot of stuff that we can still do when it comes to that like feedback stuff but yeah we don't know whether or not it's worth putting in the effort or if it's needed or if it's good or if people get it and stuff like that and that's really what you guys can help us out with if you go to our question site hit us up once the trains are out
