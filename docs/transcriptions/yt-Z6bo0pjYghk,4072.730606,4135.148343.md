### Transcript

> sake of it yeah we barely managed to, finish everything we set out to do, in update six because the the update six that you guys are gonna get to like today isn't gonna be like the full story, if you watched the video I posted last week I mentioned that, you know the update six that's coming out today isn't like the update six it's the start like that's the where we are right now and it's and it's a pretty good stable version of it, but there are more like more things to come in terms of like, tweaking certain behaviors would be for animals or creatures, there's a bunch of probably like I don't know there's probably a bunch of stuff probably like a couple of tweaks to vehicles in a lot of ways it's kind of the foundation for things that we want to build on a little bit further and the main reason that we're releasing it earlier is because it's hard for us to release later much later who would delay it at this point yeah so we were like let's just push it we have a lot of good changes that we want players to test we have a lot of major background systems that are quite impactful I think that we need tested as well yeah so it was just more practical for us to just release it early even though things aren't really finished
