### Transcript

> so one question we got here is did you crunch for update 3 not that much yeah i think you worked a lot more and not as bad as update 2 how would you compare to like the release release much more yeah that was crunchy yeah yeah we worked weekends we haven't worked a single weekend but i know yeah didn't you but you were in yes yes it's not like two hours yeah that's okay that's not crunching no there's been like so because i've seen like yesterday like dylan had like one thing at eight yeah i posted a bug yeah at like nine and he went up and fixed it at 10. yeah you're welcome uh yeah cool yeah but i'd say that uh crunch has been a lot less lately and also that we don't encourage crunch as much as we've been doing before and it's not doesn't feel as needed also because we're actually just going out just going out on experimental so it's going to be extra until this time yeah really actually nice yeah it feels pretty stable though like what i've seen but i haven't played that yeah but you haven't heard much going on we don't need to bring that up
