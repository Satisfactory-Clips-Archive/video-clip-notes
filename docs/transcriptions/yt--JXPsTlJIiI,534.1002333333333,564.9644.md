> hey everyone my name is jason i'm a community manager at coffee stain studios and today is my final video uh for 2020. so i thought i'd do something special and do a really big q a video uh there's a lot of questions it's the biggest one we've done so let's just get on with it now and we'll jump into the questions how likely will it be that our saves will break in updates after update 4. yeah so a couple weeks ago i mentioned in a video that tier 8 is coming and it will also kind of break your saves in update 4 so your saves will load but your factory will probably not be working anymore you may have to repair it i suppose uh so you could say that was not necessarily intended uh but given the direction of the game given the feedback we got um you know we had to change the way that we looked at tier viii and so we had to make some more drastic changes the intention now is that you know we want to avoid that of course and there is no there's actually no plan right now to do any other major rebalancing after update 4 into 1.0 so the current plan is no there won't be breaks but the reality is there there's a really big chance that you know we will start observing some you know some feedback from the game and we'll make decisions that you know well you know what we may need xyz for the game to be good and maybe that will result in in the uh saves breaking it is likely that this will happen again but we don't want it to and we don't plan on it but you never know our tiers 8-10 anywhere near accurate on the satisfactory wiki okay so some of you may not know this but we actually have like an official wiki which is maintained by the community um i'll leave a link to it in the descriptions down below on it there is uh listings for tier 8 tier 9 and tier 10 and some information of things that are in them or you know rumored to be in them so this question is asking how accurate are those listings in um the wikipedi the uh satisfactory wiki the answer is not accurate like at all there's actually only like one thing in tier eight that is correct and everything else is either wrong or won't exist now a lot of the information came from the fact that some tier viii related stuff was initially cooked into the build then data mined out but the thing is a lot of the stuff that was in the game a long time ago was in the game as a prototyping thing and many things have been in the game and been removed so that's kind of just what happened what was in the game years ago uh that has then been removed was not really an indication of what's actually gonna come so that's sort of where that information was based off but uh we can confirm that most of it is wrong yeah will fixmas and seasonal events in general be a regular thing maybe we don't really know it's super fun obviously like and everyone seems to be loving fixmas and that's great and it was really fun for the team to take some time away to just like focus on something really fun for a little while like if we have time we'll do it but it also really just kind of depends where we are in development at that specific moment in time as well so last year we didn't do anything christmas related and that wasn't because we didn't want to it was just like uh with all the work that was happening with update three we did not have time to stop to to get a seasonal event out so it would be cool to do other things like eastern or maybe other you know and and other things as well we'll kind of have to just sort of play it by ear you know it'll happen if it happens i guess is is the short answer will we get science anytime soon soon no soon tm yes how are you i'm good are there going to be more types of foundation shapes will there be added functionality such as rotating on other axes we plan on giving you more options with foundations and walls and this is going to be a super vague answer here but whether we do that by making more things or whether we do that by changing the way things work is something that we don't really know yet but um foundations and walls and building functionalities is not done completely as it is there there's probably going to be some changes to that um in the future will train to be getting any updates signals collision trains will definitely be getting updates it's something that we've been meaning to do for quite a long time and we're it's just been falling through so we're going to get around to trains trains are going to get more love for sure and the plan right now is to have both signals and collision on the trains we don't want to introduce one at a time we want both so it's going to be eventually the plan is that eventually trains will have both collision and signals i don't know when that's coming though but uh one day how does the current trajectory to the game compare to everyone's original concept of the final version what are some things that are better slash worse than imagined well i mean pipes [ __ ] up the game that was the biggest mistake you know so things are worse than we ever imagined now there's no going back the game's over a dead game it's all over okay so the vision of the game has evolved over time um we think for the better we have control over the direction of the game every step of the way right and every decision we make is based on you know the here and now of what does the game look like now what information can we gain by uh you know from feedback from players and then how can we make it better right so you know the game initially started with base defense being a core part of the game and then we actually started making that and then we found that we didn't like it at all and we cut it completely and now it's not going to be in there right you know and then there's the question of like well is that better or worse than we imagined well we think it's better than we imagined because the game is better now because we don't have that we believe okay so like that's kind of why we strive for it to always be better and we think that it's been going in a pretty good direction um yeah pretty normal stuff for game development i think you just sort of have to pivot and shift and react um to uh design problems that may show up as you uh develop the game will we keep our fixmas stuff after the event ends the fictional stuff will remain uh you're gonna keep all the items and whatnot but recipes or build fixmas buildings so if you tear anything down you won't get it back um anymore i guess unless we bring it back again next year or something like that uh but some things will disappear like you know advent calendars is going to go uh the mam tree is going to go uh hats the lizard doggers design is going to go wreaths on the power poles things like that will sort of disappear as well you can kind of preview what it's going to be like right now by turning off the fixmas event in game there's an option in gameplay i think to turn it off and that's basically what it's going to be like after the event ends uh so you could sort of demo that now uh yeah but you know so maybe some people want to make a bunch of cool christmas stuff and then leave it in their game so they can look at it six months from now uh and you know you should still be able to do that but if you tear it down you won't be able to build it back up again how proud on a scale of zero to 100 are you of the code you wrote and systems you helped make in satisfactory the question then goes on to sort of say it's something i struggle with sometimes wanting to be a perfectionist but knowing that perfection is the enemy of good enough sometimes i find some of my stuff well below my own standard and i never get around to improving it because everything else is more important so this is kind of just like uh like what you're mentioning here is kind of just like a problem that is pretty common in game development i suppose uh and you kind of need to find that balance between uh perfection and good enough because uh sometimes uh perfection's just not really like achievable but also uh we thought you know you know you sort of directed this at me but i thought you know what we'll we'll open this up to uh everyone in in in the office and this is the response that we got

> yeah so you can go back and pause that if you want to read it all but uh i think this is kind of telling i think this tells this person surprise only who asked this question i think this maybe gives you this heads up that a lot of the people working on this game right now feel they don't know what the hell they're doing either get forget the perfection just move forward what does a day in the life of community manager jace look like i assume wake up afternoon lunch from 1 p.m to 3 p.m and playing video games by 4 30. yeah whatever dude whatever whatever dude i think you're funny well yes how are you planning to balance optimization versus new tiers features in the future optimize as you go or as early access comes to a close and the game approaches 1.0 will there be a big push for optimization leading up to that the short answer is we just optimized as we go uh there could also maybe be pushes of optimization at certain points along the way but uh short answer is optimized as we go now we've got a couple questions here from rage boner and i two questions from rage bono because hey they're good and two his name is rage boner or their name is rage burner is player fatigue a concern for you do you see people drop off on mass at certain points in the game if so what do you do to combat this so fatigue is a is a huge thing that we look at of course for sure and we have noticed um points at which people drop off and you know maybe they're too bored or maybe they're too frustrated or something like that and so we make adjustments to those places so one example of that is actually the bauxite refinement that's something that we had noticed um that there was a lot of player fatigue around that or some issues around that and so we're making adjustments to that in update four uh more information on that in the tier viii video from a couple weeks ago can we paint vehicles yes eventually the real question is can we paint lizard logger that's the real question no one's asking it where did the idea of satisfactory come from it's easy to think it's just a 3d version of factoria but i would guess the idea originated earlier no it's pretty much 3d factorio uh that's pretty much what we called it internally as well that's basically what we were kind of going for we took some inspiration from other places as well and uh obviously after tackling design challenges that came up uh with the nature of our game you know the game took its own sort of shape and form as well but um no i mean heavily influenced by factorio of course uh but we're not a clone not a clone you guys one of the quality of life items many of us would love to have is the ability to replace walls doors windows etc without having to delete them not a question but yes it's something that we have thought of and it's also uh there's some design things that we need to be sold before we do it but you know i think that's realistic that we could have that at some point definitely a really cool idea is there a plan for nuclear waste besides being used as lizard doggo treats so for that uh tim has all the answers please dm at timberlake on twitter uh he gave some of the answers on on stream a few weeks ago i think there's an update coming where you can you can do stuff with the toxic waste leak just comes out and says this [ __ ] he has all the information on that feel free to go and dm him and ask him are there any other plans for vehicles amphibious vehicles aero vehicles uh so we have a lot of ideas for new vehicles in our backlog so we have a massive battle of things that we you know we might want to do and uh there are a lot of vehicle ideas in there um but we don't know if or when we're actually going to do anything about it something that director mark chan is thinking about is um actually upgrading the existing vehicles or uh upgrades to vehicles one example is like what if you put like mowing contraption or like mowing equipment on the tractor so that you know it becomes more viable later uh to automate it so it collects biomass or something like that i don't know maybe that's kind of cool uh biomass and lizard dogger meat you can just mow it all up together put it into its inventory hmm yeah i don't know so maybe like maybe like upgrades to vehicles could be really cool so any plans on giant boss enemies and a giant mech suit to fight them in mark thinks the uh mexico will never happen uh he's wrong of course also big crab will combat be expanded upon more enemies combat will be expanded upon the the focus isn't necessarily on combat we see uh combat as part of exploration and exploration which is um you know it's the combat it's creatures uh equipment even is you know under the umbrella of exploration uh exploration needs a little bit more work and so a lot of those pillars underneath exploration will get some love as well so there's probably gonna be some changes to the way combat works um and yeah more equipment and more creatures and a big crab are there plans for mass building foundations and walls okay so we've talked about this a bunch of times but it's a question that still comes up so many of you who uh you know watch all of our videos are like ah this question again but um the answer's generally been it's an ongoing discussion and so i figured i would ask mark you know what's the status on that and he told me he said it's still an ongoing discussion are you a woman trapped in a man's body is it really that obvious is there a reason we cannot package sulfuric acid well this question was asked before last week's video came out about the parts if you had seen that video from last week you will have noticed that packaged sulfuric acid and package alumina solution will be coming in uh update four and if you haven't seen that parts video i recommend you check it out card up here the js will there be lights yeah we plan on it one day there's gonna be lights all right they're hard to make we're gonna we're gonna make the lights they'll be in the game one day we're looking into it if you were a satisfactory building what building would you be i'd be a biomass burner i'd be a biomass burner really [ __ ] simple and basic uh i thought that we would ask snoop this as well and see what he said um and he said that his favorite is a steel furnace okay oh and by the way for those wondering simon would definitely be the superposition oscillator you know it's not even a building it's just an enigma all right is simon okay i don't know let's ask him hi simon how are you hey i'm i'm good thank you fine good all right thanks man by the way what did you think about cyberpunk so far it's all right why don't my computer streams in my hub show me power consumption or total production because we didn't program them to yeah it's a highly requested feature this kind of thing uh some ability to monitor your um overall power consumption or production and things like that would be cool to have it in the game solved in some way it probably wouldn't be on tiny screens you know or we could have those screens to display some stuff but if you know you probably want more detail and maybe a custom menu in order to do all that so it's uh you know it's a lot of work and and if we can find a way to do it i think it's something that might come but um yeah it's just uh it's just a matter of you know actually doing it our farm is gonna be a thing so farms and farming um is something that we're pretty sure we're actually gonna do at some point um unless we change our mind okay but as it stands right now farming is something that we've had in our minds for a little while and um has been appealing and and and has continued to be quite appealing for for this game however if we do do it we don't think we're going to do it before 1.0 we don't think we need it for 1.0 so um that's the current situation on farms farming will there ever be third person uh it's something that we want i mean why not some people like it however third person actually comes with a lot of unique challenges that we would need to solve you know if we if we have third person in the game if we support it then we have to make sure that it works well as well and building in 3d is obviously quite a hard design problem for us to have solved in the first place and we've done a decent job now but uh changing to third person introduces new issues and so we would need to solve that as well it's a cool thing to have but uh it's not driving the game forward i guess and so that's so it's like it's constantly falling short of the priority list i suppose we'll see we'll see if it happens or not character customization uh yeah we think that we're going to have that uh to what capacity we don't really know yet like are you just going to change your colors or will there be different skins or like hats you can wear um who knows we think that we'll probably end up adding character customization at some point it makes sense and it makes a lot of sense for multiplayer as well names in photo mode when uh so this is a question from braindg someone uh one of our content creators does a lot of cool uh community games and community events definitely check them out uh if you haven't dg uh and they've been wanting names in photo mode for a long time for you know pictures they take and you want to see who's in the pictures right i'm sure a lot of people want this as well now this is something that we'll probably have at some point the problem is that uh it's kind of low prior and so it never really makes it onto the priority list either um another one of those things but we kind of do want to enhance photo mode in general and so it may be that we're just going to wait until we allocate a bunch of time to make a better photo mode then we'll then have the names uh show up in photo mode as an option there as well so definitely something good i'm sorry brain it's taking so long but there's a lot of things people ask for that take a long time so uh it'll come any thoughts on adding drones to the game that would get you suppliers from the factory while you're building far away and don't have a vehicle pass set up yet so we hear you on the second part of that question um in that it's problematic when you're building far away and you want to get supplies to you so you know that is a problem that could be solved in some way but whether it's drones whether it's something else don't know but uh totally hear the the concern or the problem that you're experiencing there and we'll find some some way to work it out do you miss australia or is sweden better so for those of you who don't know i'm australian so i grew up there uh but i live in sweden because that's where coffee stain is and i've been living here for a while um but i don't really miss australia i i don't like have a thing against australia or anything like that i like australia it's a great place but i don't i don't really miss it i'm i'm happy here in sweden will there be new biomes uh well we can ask hannah so hannah what do you think are we gonna have any new biomes no okay she seemed pretty pretty sure on that one do you enjoy working from home or are you looking forward to getting back into the office uh personally i love it i love working from home uh i'm the kind of person who loves a lot of a lot of alone time so so this uh has actually been amazing for me uh working from home uh but you know there's not everyone is like that a lot of people needed to to get out and you know work in an office i'm sure a lot of folks out there um uh can can identify with with that as well so there are some people who go back and work at the office and and um due to the regulations that we have here that's okay so long as it's not too many people and there's not that many people and we have a really big office so uh so some people get to uh go back and work at the office but i love it working from home will sam or ever be useful yes how do you have your coffee and slash or tea so i prefer tea to coffee and uh i like it black just with a pinch of cocaine just a little little pick me up you know extra get that extra kick give me you'll be starting for the work day do you ever look at the mods and think there are features you'd like to include in the full game uh not really most of the things that uh have been like modded we've already had like either planned for or have been in our backlog or something like that there are a couple things that have come up that are you know that we hadn't thought of that we now uh think of whether we'll do it or not don't know i think i think something that's really interesting is seeing the implementation of specific features you know so sometimes we may have a feature in mind but we don't visualize uh how it's supposed to be and how it's supposed to function and we get to see examples of that via mods and so that's pretty cool as well also there's something actually kind of strange that happens alright so like word on the street is is that whenever we start talking about a new feature that we want internally you know around the launch table the modders then release that feature like two days later so uh i'm putting my tinfoil beanie on and uh and uh i don't know what's going on there no kind of sucks vote lime green all right dedicated server status report okay so dedicated servers are still being worked on we're chipping away at multiplayer bugs and we need to solve those multiplayer bugs first before we can do uh dedicated service so it's not uh so much an issue of making the functionality of dedicated servers the issue is m is fixing bugs that will break the gameplay experience completely whether you're on a dedicated server or not and most of the issues people are having are issues that dedicated servers will not fix we need to fix those bugs as they are something to remember is that if you're on a dedicated server what means is the server is the host and you're the client and everyone playing is the client and most people reporting issues are people who are playing as clients and what what this means is on a dedicated server everyone will have that client experience and no one will have the host experience that's something to remember here so the focus on getting dedicated servers working is making sure that our multiplayer works better and we are constantly working on that so that's the the status report is we're still working on it do you plan to add copy and paste functionality or slash blueprints or any other way to quickly duplicate existing factories okay so we've answered this question a bajillion times but again this is an ongoing discussion uh people still ask so i'm gonna answer it again the answer was always a no and i thought well because it's ongoing i'll check in with mark and i checked in with mark mark's thoughts have actually shifted a little bit he's kind of starting to think that it's more of a it is kind of more of a good idea now this is just mark's opinions mark even though he's the director doesn't mean he makes every single decision right we're a team of people and we everyone has different opinions and and uh so you know everyone everyone's opinion's way in here right but but mark's opinions um if we were to do it we don't think that victoria's blueprint system is what we would want or we don't think just a simple copy paste is what we would want but some kind of functionality to facilitate the repetition that people experience could be cool so that's that's the that's the update for you that's uh mark's current opinion on it which is different than before so there's movement there but um i can't really tell you anything more than that because that's literally it yeah has the decision to press on to 1.0 recently been prompted at least in part by financials my impression was you folks did like experimenting with updates before 1.0 and there were updates planned but ultimately shelved okay so that's a pretty interesting impression i'm not sure what gave you that impression but i get the feeling that maybe you're not alone like maybe we've given that impression somehow so i figure i'll just talk about it anyway and i'll clear the air there actually kind of was a little bit of a shift uh to focus on 1.0 but it wasn't prompted by sales or anything like that like we're doing great you guys um thank you the prompt was mostly like well we got to do update four now uh and after update four it's gonna be update five and in order to really plan what we should do in those we need some idea of what the end goal is gonna be so we really just started focusing more on 1.0 uh as a means of having some kind of direction so that we weren't shooting in the dark basically and that's pretty much it and we have a pretty good idea of what that is now we're still always refining it but uh yeah we really want to go for it because you know we're an early access game and we feel that it's it's our responsibility to get out of early access we need to we need to finish the game and and give you the experience that we wanted right and that doesn't mean development stops after 1.0 you know we could still add stuff maybe i'm not saying we will but we've always alluded to the fact that we probably would add more yeah we still want to we kind of want to get out of early access you know that doesn't mean you know we're not cutting things out to get there to rush to get in we're clearly not rushing you guys we're so slow with our updates we're not rushing we we sit back and we take an honest look at okay what are we doing what do we want what do we consider a good finished 1.0 game and then we're gonna work towards that but that shift did kind of happen uh a few months ago and you know the fact that you brought up this question i guess it shows in some in somehow and that's really interesting to me so thanks for the question that was good okay so that's a lot of questions a lot of answers uh and if you found it interesting or informative or helpful or fun and entertaining even uh leave a comment down below and give it a like and i just want to say before i go a big thank you to the community thank you so much um uh not super good at doing this stuff but thank you um this year has been crazy and it's you know a lot of things happened and you guys were there with us the whole time being supportive and positive and and um passionate as well and active and these are not things that as a game developer that i or we should take for granted uh i think it's clear that if you look around at a lot of games out there that are you know they don't always have this kind of support and and we are fortunate to have that we're fortunate to have you guys um being as amazing as you are and as funny as you are so uh thank you very much for putting up with me and thank you very much for playing our game thanks for sharing screenshots and memes and videos uh on youtube and streaming the game and thanks for joining us for these videos and on stream as well thank you so much for making those um uh worthwhile even i guess so um yeah i i'm not yeah like i said i'm not really good at doing this stuff but uh i just want to say that i don't take you all for granted uh i appreciate you all and i i think we're very fortunate to have a community like the community we have um and it's it's an honor to be your community manager you guys so thank you all very much for an amazing 2020. well it's as good as the world was on fire but we were doing great great job everyone um uh and i look forward to uh continuing to be your community manager in 2021 some of you will be happy to hear that some of you may be less so who knows anyway whatever enough jokes thanks again everyone stay safe over the holidays and i will see you next year okay bye
