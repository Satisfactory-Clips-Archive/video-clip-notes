### Transcript

> um and uh another thing that we're specifically looking into is the plutonium balance this is something that i'm sure you guys have seen i've seen discussion about this already um and that's the fact that you can totally sink now hold on total wait wait for it okay don't don't don't know me yet because wait for it okay so if you don't know right now up until this point there's never been a possibility to sink plutonium uranium waste right in the game it's always been like an unsinkable thing and that's kind of still the same case you can sink uranium waste plutonium waste from the plutonium production line but there is a one little loophole and that is the plutonium fuel rods are sinkable and that is by design believe it or not um that has been intentional because we kind of want to see putting this in we kind of want to see what you guys feel about it and we kind of want to see if um the decision making in like is it worth going through the whole plutonium production line and sink it just to get rid of the waste or if you feel like the um nuclear like production power production line is worth it you know like is it worth keeping that or is it better to just sync it and i don't think we're going to remove that option in the game but we may tweak a little bit of like how much power you get from plutonium versus uranium so that hearts attacks all around um so we'll like buff or nerf either one i'm not quite sure exactly what's gonna happen there um and we're still kind of looking at it uh based on on you guys feedback uh but right now we feel like maybe being able to sink plutonium fuel rods is a bit too like uh what's the word like it's like the obvious better option maybe now uh or maybe not we don't know it's we're kind of like waiting a little bit to see what community thinks um above biomass biomath is just like one biomass generator is better than a new whole nuclear setup so that's something we're going to tweak i'm not saying we're going to remove the fact that we can sink plutonium fuel rods i'll be that's not impossible but i don't think that's going to happen because we do like this like trade-off kind of where you're weighing the benefits and the trade like the issues and the benefits of doing that so we'll see we'll see
