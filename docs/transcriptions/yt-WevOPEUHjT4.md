> and whatnot, will there be an update on how many copies of the gold the game has sold in the future I don't know I don't kind of think so I don't think there's really any need for it personally like, you know we released the the total sales around key moments that kind that kind of indicate, successful lack thereof, but we succeeded in our cases, doing another one in like six months is going to be I don't know it feels kind of random and and- I don't I don't think we've ever really necessarily, that feels weird to talk about that's just the thing it's always felt weird to talk about we like I think part of the reason we've we've talked about it before is, one it puts the reality out there if the game is doing good or bad, you can see now right like there that's there are the numbers now no one has to speculate anything, , and then but then the notion of like you know when we have good numbers it's like well are we just gloating right so if it feels weird to talk about it and- I don't know if it's ever going to serve a purpose or maybe maybe someday but there has to be a reason I think forced to do it rather than just just for littles it's also a little bit tricky because the embracer who owns coffee stain like our conglomerate or whatever it's called like, they're publicly traded so we can't just like throw around sales numbers however we want we have to like check in with them as well to some degree or something I don't know exactly how that works, because something something but yeah
