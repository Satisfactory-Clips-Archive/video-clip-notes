> you guys gonna address the bugs and crashes with dedicated servers yes at some point we will dedicated servers kind of run on its own track so to speak because it's not they're not very tied to like the updates per se, so but we we are going to get around to the dedicated service they're also like experimentals they are released kind of prematurely in a sense but and unfortunately we haven't really been able to, dedicate too much time, to them in the recent like six months or maybe even a little more unfortunately which is not good but at the end of the day we had to divert our time to other things but, I know that recently more talk about the dedicated servers and what we plan on doing with them has kicked off internally and so hopefully we can get some more time and work done on them but the intention 100 is not to leave them as they are, it's just that we've been focusing on the main game more than dedicated service but they're we intend on improving them yeah and we definitely feel bad that we haven't been able to do as much with it because there is as we have wait yeah so, but yeah we're gonna get around to it eventually
