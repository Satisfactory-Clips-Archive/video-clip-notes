> why does the chainsaw doesn't consume fuel wait it should it i mean it should if it doesn't consume fuel it's a bug, my neighbor is using the chainsaw right now if you're asking why the chainsaw uses solid biofuel and you you are asking about like why it's not consuming other fuel types that is probably something that's going to be added in the future package fuel okay yeah then i'm asking that the correct question so that's something that we're probably gonna add in the future the problem that we have currently is that there's no good way in the ui to like pick fuel type for for equipment and it's a little bit of an issue that we can't do that right now and we haven't had time to implement that so that's why we haven't added like more alternatives to to fuel and then the next question a lot of people say that why can't you just like pick the best one in your inventory and the reason for that is because we don't think that's a good solution because then it could pick fuel types that you don't want it to pick so right now we just decided okay for now let's just do that it uses the first we pick the fuel type and it sticks with that, until the end and in the future we're going to make it so that you can maybe, choose what fuel type you want to use for it, so yes in the future we're probably going to fix something do a wheel yeah maybe the the problem with that the wheel is that it's not intuitive maybe that you need to access that wheel, and it's also an issue like if we if you pick a fuel type and you run out of that fuel and you have the other one and you think you've picked the other one then it also needs to be like obvious that you're out of that fuel and maybe you need to switch you know that kind of stuff make two chainsaws one for each fuel what what about an alternate recipe for a chainsaw and that chainsaw only uses turbo fuel or something like that mark are you listening i got a great idea i bet mark already thought of this and he's like you dummy right fixed it exactly turbo saw i love that name holy that's amazing yo we kind of need to add it just because of that name actually oh i love it on the topic of chainsaws by the way you guys i know that some people have requested being able to, to like turn off the aoe thing on the chainsaw so you can like pick a certain tree and and chop it down that's also something that we've considered, adding in the future i think turbo saw we need specifically speedy deforestation exactly exactly i love it
