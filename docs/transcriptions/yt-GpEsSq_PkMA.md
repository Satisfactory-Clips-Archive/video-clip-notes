> something fix easter maybe who knows yeah easter egg season I mean that sounds funny it's sort of I guess it sort of depends on what we're doing because like, a lot of times you know like people wanted we're asking for like a halloween event for example and I think like I feel like the team's probably down to do seasonal events almost with every seasonal event because they're they're kind of fun but the problem is like sometimes we're like knee-deep in an update and we can't really we can't really do that right, even fixmas this past year was very lucky and yeah it was really tight and we pulled that out of our ass like it was unreal, but, so like I think if if like planning wise if we don't have if we have space to create something fun for easter I'm sure I'm sure people in the studio will would be psyched to do that but if they're not then we probably won't one of you know one of the key things with these seasonal events is that people have to feel in the office have to feel like motivated to do it and inspired to do it and feel that fun and energy we can't like force it you know yeah and around around fixedness they they really feel it the people who get involved they're really feeling it and they do a great job because of that fixmas is, has always been like our product manager says like okay if anybody wants to do anything you're free to do something just let us know what you want to do there's not like anyone saying like okay let's make something for fixmas let's make this thing or this thing the people want to fix miss so like you you and you you're now making fixmes yeah you know it's it's not like that so if no one is feeling to make anything for easter then you know that we can't really like say like no we have to have a seasonal event you know it has to come from the heart yep kind of like there's only one big holiday event that's true maybe and maybe the team feels that way as well right maybe they you know like if they're doing a bunch of holiday events maybe it just gets kind of like stale for them you know it's not this like one-off novelty thing that we get to do once a year or something who knows it's up to the team
