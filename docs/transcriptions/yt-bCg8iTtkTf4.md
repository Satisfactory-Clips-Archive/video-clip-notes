> and uh yes you like the way let's game it out plays your game yeah of course i like the way everyone plays the game there's there's no one right way or wrong way to do it we really like that there's so many different ways people can play the game you know some people really love doing the spreadsheeting out of the game min maxing stuff that's one play style other people just want to make things that look cool they don't care if it works or not other people just like to they just want to get the the the research milestones um and they don't really care how things look or if they're running out 100 um efficiency and some people just like to dick around like josh does um and i i think that's really good that's one of the things that makes uh you know that has made satisfactories as successful as it is that a lot of people can find their own way to play it so yeah it's really good something that we've talked i think we talked about this with josh when he was on stream a while ago with us was the fact that like you know we don't do like any i mean even less now in the t5 but we didn't do a lot of like you know collision checking with like the conveyor belt and stuff like that because people that care about clipping they won't clip stuff and we're sort of okay with that and we're you know losing that even more so with update 5 when we're introducing the soft clearance and heart clearance where you know now you can totally go bananas with your your conveyor belts and pipes and cosmetics and build them wherever you want like you don't have to care about clipping anymore and you know the sort of people that care about that stuff they will still you know like i i still care about that stuff like i won't do too much soft clip if unless it looks good but like at least now you have the option and we've always been sort of like okay with that that like people are free to play the game they want to and that's yeah we think that's how hard was
