> that spreadsheet sounds interesting how many don't want to see that, too many too many I have four open right now and I have one that's a weird flex yeah it's so chaotic man you don't want to see it yeah like I said I'm not I'm glad like this is the same thing when I worked on like rpg games I was like we looked at the spreadsheet that some of the game designers had when they were like like balancing you know like time to death and like how long it should take to kill enemies and like how they should ramp when you're level up and stuff like that and I'm just like oh my god this is just like too much math too much spreadsheet yeah and the best part is that it it just gets out of hand at some point because you start all clean and everything but then development actually happens and you have to just get going right so you never have time to clean it up anymore so I just I'm just sitting with this pile of here that I try to make sense of I guess that's what I think just that I was just gonna say it's color-coded in this way that nobody will ever understand because I just use random colors to indicate certain things instead of just leaving notes everywhere so it's a bit more oversightful so I know that I still need to look into something or that something is good or bad or questionable
