### Transcript

> anyway so that's the uh the resource well uh extraction method the resource wells and the new gas you might be wondering what will gases be used for they're going to be used for you know the creation of new parts and stuff they're going to be tied into the blender actually quite a lot so if you check the uh i'll put a link up here we made a uh like a like a teaser video of the blender last week that came out on our youtube channel uh here yeah so the so the blender is going to be making use of the nitrogen gas and some examples of some parts that are going to be the nitrogen nitrogen will be responsible for will be the fused modular frame this was actually teased over the fixmas advent current calendar some people could get it and if you read the description there's kind of a teaser in there that you know nitrogen was a thing so yes you can use nitrogen to create fused modular frames there'll be a cooling system which is going to be a new part and there's going to be nitric acid as well which will be responsible for some new refinement and fuel production processes
