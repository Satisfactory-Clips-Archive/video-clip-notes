> DLS is satisfactory so DLS s dlss is not planned at the moment because we haven't seen any, reasonable like reason to do it because the thing with the LSS is that it improves the rendering time or like it it fakes rendering like it it low it unloads rendering time off the GPU but the game is CPU Bound for the most part so it wouldn't actually make a huge difference, so so we haven't really seen a huge advantage of having that and also if you have a GPU that can support dlss then you already have a GPU that's well within reason to be able to render the game like rendering isn't a heavy portion for satisfactory this is It's the CPU bound game, so if your course are maxed then or like if your CPU is Max then like having a faster GPU won't actually increase the the render time, not even my save I mean I'm not sure but there's a bunch of issues too with, with, like the way we do rendering as well where the LSS wouldn't really work because it can't actually do proper proper Magic so we don't really we don't really think there's going to be any good gain by implementing it at the moment
