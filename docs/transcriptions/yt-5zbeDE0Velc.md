### Transcript

> uh did satisfactory have any other names before you settled on it uh do you know that chase a factory game yeah factory game is the working title that's why you see it everywhere uh yeah the folders and stuff that's what we named it when we started the projects and we didn't have any i don't from memory i don't really think so like we went through a phase where we were voting on names and satisfactory kind of won and some people took issue with satisfactory me included i didn't like it at first um i was wrong uh it's a good name um but yeah so we sort of voted on stuff and then sort of just sort of debated on it we didn't decide on it we kind of just stopped talking about it for a while and then we just kind of said yeah we'll just go satisfactory uh but it was it was a good it's a good name it was a good decision like uh i you know it's not like i feel like even if we didn't go with it i would have remembered that name as an option you know whereas i don't remember any of the other names as often as they probably don't matter but satisfactory was like a little a little bit memey um turns out it works really well with our community management style where we're very okay with just being average yeah mediocre is more than enough i will say that if if if i was around at the time when we were deciding on names i would also be like against it i think if if i just heard that as a name i'd be like no why but i'll i but also i agree that like that's probably the best name we could have come up with that because it does make sense and it's like i couldn't imagine another name for the game yeah honestly like after especially now that i joined it and like i didn't know any others like i don't i can't see any other name for this game at this point like it's already ruined for me
