> okay so bogdan was restarting the server that was going on and then, yeah we got the bs as well we've been working a lot on a bunch of stuff a bunch of stuff yeah muscle creatures yeah creatures stuff and, we're gonna try and break the ai system today yes I know that would be great somebody has mentioned like before there's a couple of like, yeah books that we're like hoping we won't run into because like one thing that we really have to sort of drill in here is that the, like a lot of systems aren't like fully fully finished like I mentioned before for update six, we're in like a good state but there's still a bunch of stuff coming, and and one of the like major things that we felt like was a bit lacking is the creature stuff and that's mostly because it takes time to sort of you know nail it down I think we're pretty happy with like the ai system itself, has changed quite drastically like from almost from scratch or ground up yeah
