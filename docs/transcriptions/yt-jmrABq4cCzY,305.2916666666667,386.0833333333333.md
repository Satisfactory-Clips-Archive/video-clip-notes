> something else i also want to address is a bug that a lot of people actually got upset that we fixed and that was one of the bugs with there were some foundations with like a downward slope where it didn't have like any collision at all uh or some collision i'm not quite sure exactly what the state of that was but it was a bug nonetheless where some of the foundations didn't clip and that bug was kind of like fixed unintentionally because we didn't necessarily sought out to fix that bug but it kind of did now i just want to talk a little about this okay because we kind of want collision on foundations but we do understand how that was such an atu building and we really don't want to take that away from you um so what we're gonna do for now is we're gonna reintroduce that bug with the foundation stuff and in the future for for some coming update maybe the next one or the one after that we're going to look into ways to make it possible for you to build the same way without you know utilizing something unintentional with the game with like a bug like that we want you to be able to pursue those kind of creative builds and be able to do the things that you can with the limitations of the game um but we also want collision do foundations but we're gonna we're gonna work something out but but in the meantime we're gonna reintroduce that bug
