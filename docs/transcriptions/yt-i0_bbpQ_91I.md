> uh the game needs small flying vehicles travel long distance um i just seen that so so this is where i i've mentioned this a bunch of times i'm gonna say it again but uh i don't i don't think you do need a small flying vehicle to travel long distance because if you did then long distances won't be long distances anymore um and then you may find some other thing that you need oh like the flying vehicle is too slow i want to i want to mark two one and so that bar just keeps moving um so the thing is like long distances are supposed to be hard that's the thing that's the point of them uh and just to take them away is no good it's it's the the same kind of concept where people want uh to build large like uh like like uh what's the word mass builds a bunch of things or copy paste large things um yeah i mean it sounds good in principle but it just moves the bar and changes the game completely it makes what was hard easy and then you get new hard stuff and then you want something to make the new thing harder uh so i don't know i think the the challenge is um the challenge is that challenge is supposed to be there
