> how about a hypertube exit you can place it anywhere on a hypertube and exit there without having to place up your entrance oh i see what you mean so you can like hop out at different points on the hypertube sounds like a pretty cool idea i don't know i don't know if it's something that we would do i mean again make the suggestion qa side i say it a million times but it's like that's you know it's okay to bring it up here and then i get a sense of what people want right but if you put it on the qa site people will check it and it's it's it's there it stays there, yeah like people have asked about things like splitting hypertubes and stuff like that i think there's a desire for that kind of stuff don't really know how it would work or if it's possible but you know we see i know that other people at the office have seen those kind of suggestions too
