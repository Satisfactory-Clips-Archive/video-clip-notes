> did any of the streams on here or on steam show active development i know you did a little series on youtube where you showed what everyone did uh yeah so we we have done like a couple devstreams in the past but then we kind of find ourselves in a position where we kind of can't really do it that well because if something's like kind of not on video you kind of want to tease things like yeah we want to like yeah we want to sort of unveil things and we usually do that when they're in a state where they're almost done pretty much but it would it would definitely be cool to get more um development streams going just need to figure out a way to sort of do it and also time weight time wise as well um because people are busy because it slows people down yeah if they're going to be streaming work it's going to slow him down that's another aspect if people want to do it too it makes sense for them
