### Transcript

> all right so I'm going to bring in mark now into the call, mark can you hear me cool I can't hear you if you can hear me or whatever, hopefully mark will point and poke in maybe mark forgot about us he's like you said oh oh here we go hey mark hey man let me also bring you into the thing I was trying to lower my mic and then I realized it was already lowered oh I see you you went too far yeah I was just feeling on the side of it like where the did it go gotcha well you're here now and that's all that matters all right everybody so let's give a warm warm welcome to mark mark is here hey mark hi mark hey guys never heard that before, yeah it's a classic, so yeah mark is our game director for satisfactory if this is a first time seeing mark marcus appeared on a couple of streams in the past it's been a while now actually I think but here we are mark is back mark gives the best updates on what actually is the the rationale behind design decisions in the game because he actually knows them I try, so yeah so yeah there's geez there's so much to talk about, about update six it's it's like it's rough that we reveal everything at the same time because like where do we even begin but, I kind of just wanted to touch upon like the the whole reasoning behind why we're focusing on the exploration aspect specifically and like the like what what do you think what would you say is like the main goal with the changes that we're doing for this update, I mean you mentioned in the video I think quite well that we we've kind of always pushed it under under everything else right we felt it's underdeveloped, it's one of our selling points I think it's satisfactory that we have a handcrafted map, and that it features exploration that you can kind of compensate in different parts of the game by exploring and get different things done that way but we have always focused a lot on different aspects of the game and haven't really been able to focus as much on this part of the game and it it's not just about going out there and fighting creatures and getting the rewards it's also things like the map and the mam to us are part of the whole exploration gameplay loop we've been wanting to improve that for a while now right yeah because I think that's that's we haven't talked too much about that yet and I think we we're like I think that will make more sense when we actually reveal more things that we're making but yeah the the whole goal here isn't necessarily just to like make the environment look more fancy and like you can go out and ppu more enemies like that it's the whole game loop right and the the aspects of that yeah and it's essentially bringing that part of the game to the same quality level maybe not the same, amount of quality and definitely this the same quality level as the rest of the game right so especially things like rai we've always kind of felt like, it's not that good we have some issues there we've had problems with creatures spawning in really late for example or just ai having issues with terrain and navigation and we feel it kind of undermines all through the rest of the game right like it's a part of the game so it needs to be good it needs to fit in with the rest and that means that it has to be same kind of quality standard yeah gotcha, so we are going to talk about the overclocking stuff, I think this is a pretty big topic right now in our community, I'm thinking if there's anything else to mention we will probably get around to like if there's any questions you guys have we might dive into that but so let's address the elephant in the room or whatever and talk about overclocking so what what what is the from from your point of view like what is the main rationale behind why you came to us and were like hey we might change the overclocking like what was the there's different points there so for one right it's an exploration tied in feature hence that we're looking at it now because it's all about collecting these slugs to then overclock that's something that we have felt for a while is that the slug's value isn't that high to a certain group of players because of the fact that overclocking isn't that good because the trade of that is there where you trade basically getting an easier solution to either producing more or saving space or just getting rid of an annoying problem in your production line, it requiring more power that trade-off to a lot of players we have seen isn't very, isn't really worth it and that unmasked slugs and the view of spending time right mark's mark's headset is a bit funky sometimes you're just like turning into am I roboting again yeah and it comes and goes so it's fine now I don't know what is causing that yeah it's weird anyway you can still hear me properly yeah yeah yeah yeah I'll give you a heads up if it happens okay that's kind of the reason that we started looking at it and I mean there's there's basically may three main reasons, why we looked at it this way to make it linear and, increasing the value of slugs in this exploration is one of them because we want players to see multiple different ways of solving a problem and one of those could be then go and exploring to get more slugs to solve a problem in your in your factory right and we want that that solution to be, to be a valid solution and then there is the thing where we see that there's probably an issue for new players that they see this overclocking thing I think like hey that is nice I can solve this problem way easier this way especially if they have a small factory then they probably have enough shards to solve a bunch of their issues yeah or just expand their production but then they don't realize that they use more power yeah that's of course something that they might have to learn or that we could give more feedback on but we also saw the option like if we just removed the exponential increase in power we don't even have to solve that problem in another way it just disappears there's there's definitely like a a subset of people when they play the game that like constantly run into power issues and they're just like why I feel like I'm making a lot of power, and it might be the case where like there are overclocking a lot, and not like realizing just how significant that power change is because it's not super obvious when you do overclock that the power requirements change because I believe when you drag the power overclocking slider it doesn't update the like in output values immediately it just shows you like or how does it work again there's something with when you drag the slider it doesn't actually update until actually the factory starts producing stuff yeah I think a lot of the values only update when it has completed a new cycle yeah, so I'm sure that's I think that is still currently the case when it comes to the production window in a production building so you have a value that updates right away, at the target value on the of the bottom side next to the slider but the actual actual values like all the values fall on the update I think later yeah but I could be wrong about that because we have done updates on that in the past as well to improve that yeah there's something I remember because I do all like the way I use overclocking a lot of times is to even out ratios because I'm lazy and I don't want to do too much math so sometimes I'll always have like one or two factory buildings where like, if I just overclock this to like 1 25 or whatever I'll it'll be an even ratio and I don't have to care about the the issues with that and I'll just live with that, and I think like a lot of people that start out do it that way, to just get the even split if they care about that stuff but then we got the first two reasons so we got the the low level player as we call it the low level player reason where they don't understand how the system works and themselves over essentially which is something that we don't want of course, then we have the value of the slugs and then lastly we have to think where we see a lot of high-end players we we're assuming that quite a few high-end players are at some point starting to overclock even though they know that this in a way is less efficient just because they want to keep playing the game and they have a lot of buildings in their factory and their computers are starting to have issues so then a valid way to fix that for them is to overclock but we don't want them to have to undermine the thing that is really important to them which is efficiency in the factory to keep playing the game we would rather have it that it kind of goes hand in hand of course yeah but then the the difficult thing with this whole solution is that it's of course not the only solution to any of these problems like we could increase the value of slugs by giving them another purpose that might be nice and then players might have to pick on how they want the use of slugs we could, improve, the feedback on when you use exponential power we could improve the balancing of power if people are really struggling with power to solve the problem that way there is probably other solutions as well that we haven't considered for for any of these problems really and for high-end players as well yeah to make sure that they don't run into the building cap as quickly because that is also like an aspect that maybe not a lot of people, you know now that we we sort of lead you guys into this but you know when we when we prompt you about this and asking your opinions about this like the problems that we have here can be solved in many ways and this is one way, to solve them like and I know a lot of people have given like different, takes on like what if you do like linear up into 100 and then do exponential or you know do keep the trade-off when you're going over 100 but don't have it when you go under, and stuff like that and, you know there's there's there's a lot of different ways you could do this and I don't know if if we'll ever hit like a magical like everyone's happy we solved all the issues we compromised
>
> [Music]
>
> because we are solving sort of different problems and people might even see different problems when they talk about the overclocking issues and stuff like that yeah and that's just something we have to accept because I don't think we can make everyone happy and I don't think no matter what the decision is now that we make for this I mean some people are gonna think it's not the right choice but there is always that difference as well between the theoretical idea of how this is gonna impact your play compared to how it actually affects you when you're actually playing yeah so a big thing that we have been I mean we've been talking a lot about this since like monday because of the video dropping and then all the different perspectives coming out and that is of course the reason as well that we ask for everyone's opinion is because we kind of we just wanted to know what people felt about this like there's different ways of solving a lot of these problems and we kind of want to know if this is a valid path for us to take yeah and we might still do it anyway no matter what what people are saying just to try it and that is kind of the benefit as well of just being in early access and being able to change these things kind of on the fly because I think even if we change it it's not going to have like a direct impact where it's not really going to ruin everyone's factory if we change it back and forth it's it's a bit easier that way than than it is, with a lot of the balance other balancing issues that we have then we need to do more consideration yeah but sometimes it's just best to try a thing and just see how it rolls yeah I guess there's a lot of people if they've like underclocked a lot and they like perfectly balance their power consumption or something they might get a power spike or something yeah but you know for I think for a lot of people it will be a buff, yeah and I think it's I mean it's it's problems that are easier to solve than a whole production line being messed up because we changed the recipe right it's probably you just need to build a bit more power and you're good to go rather than having to overhaul your entire your entire setup yeah, are there any like compromises that you've seen that you felt like this is actually an interesting way to do or like do you see any reason why any of the like different takes on how we could change the system, apart from making it linear, yeah I've seen some things, I'm not sure yet how valid like what is mark's top 10 like alternate versions of overclocking you know yeah I haven't stored in my brain actually when I started and I've seen a suggestion before when I started thinking of this I was like would it be fun to have upgrades in the mam so that you could reduce the exponent as you progress for the game because especially what we were looking at back then when I started coming with that that proposal was that we wanted to mostly make it more effective for end game players to use it for that whole performance issue because we're like what if we could make this nicer to use for end game players and then and then fix the performance and then also explain to players hey there is an exponent exponential growth here by having those, those a person I've seen that exactly oh mark I'm just rolling it out oh god is it good again yeah it's just like when you stop talking for a second it just fixes itself it's so weird what the yeah yeah I've had it before in meetings as well I'm not sure I just need a new headset maybe yeah I don't know if it's the headset or if it's like I always thought it was teams interference yeah maybe it's interference I don't know we're on discord now yeah so maybe it's not teams actually oh weird anyway sorry, but yeah I mean I was saying that yeah that exact suggestion, that from the proposal that I just described I've seen that come by and I really like generally how people are engaging with this I think that's been the most fun part to see where he asked like a question like this and then the whole chat just explodes in the youtube comments just about this topic and there's so many different takes and people trying to like find midway solutions and stuff yeah and it's really just fun to look at and it's, I mean it's really useful for us because what we're really looking for is what is important to players right like we want to know sure it's interesting to see the different solutions but what we really want to know is what what people want out of the system what do they want out of the game and how can we try to find a way that it supports these different player types that we're looking at here yeah for sure, what does it say I got so distracted by a comment in chat and I'm sorry my whole day is ruined, no
>
> [Laughter]
>
>, yeah like yeah one thing that I think is really interesting is like there's so many there's so many different takes on on like ways to do it, I'm kind of I kind of stumped actually that there are so many different ways to I guess that kind of like serves the purpose of like the problem that we're quote unquote solving or whatever is that like there's many solutions to the same thing and I don't know if one is necessarily better than the other,
>
> [Music]
>
> but we but we have like our own sort of set of like the thing you mentioned in the beginning of the rationale behind this decision like the the investigation of it the things that we kind of want to investigate and look into solving, and maybe under cl maybe linear overclocking is the way to go or maybe it's not, yeah no matter what I think we will just try a thing, we've been discussing different ways to move forward it because we might just also need more information on it I mean that's again why it's good that we're having this discussion also with the community yeah and then we'll probably proceed I mean no matter what we do there's going to be people that disagree with the decision and they're going to really keep talking about it and that is fine because if we change something we kind of need to know people experience it after that as well and I kind of keep swaying back and forth as well we're like ah but it's fun to have to trade off but it kind of sucks that it isn't linear yeah in these other scenarios so yeah it's just, I mean it's a difficult opportunity I don't think there is like a set one vessel and that is the thing I think that the people that kind of want to keep the system they like the trade-off part right because that is a big part of the game is that you have to sometimes just make decisions between what what is best for you in a certain situation that's kind of what a lot of our things are built upon especially for example the ultra investments yeah because actually yeah sorry because I certainly know where I lay or like lie in this discussion I like that the way that it works right now with the trade-off but I also don't build like I don't know if- I think I build in like a sort of medium sized range of like buildings because I have never done I've never gone full bonanza making like nutty like I want to make 5 000, sugar daddies per minute in my sugar daddy factory like I always go like I just want to get it done I just want to finish this thing and then if I can't make the ratio work out then I'll overclock and make it work you know and lay it out, and I like that trade-off because like that means that okay but then I have to think about power, but I also I also know how the the overclocking system works, and I know that is that that is like a conscious decision that I make when I do overclock stuff, that I have keep that in mind, yeah but if that is the main issue right if we're really looking at the main issue being that people don't know how it works then then of course that's not not a good enough reason to change the entire system then there's always ways to give feedback to make it clear and I do think that like that size that you're that you're describing building at that is probably the right size for actually using the system yeah anyway or being even smaller than that because what we want as well is that players that maybe aren't as hardcore with factory building might have more issues with it but still want to play the game that they have ways to compensate there's like different ways to solve problems that don't require them to just keep building bigger and bigger to get more, production going yeah or to solve an issue I don't know if you saw I don't know why this reminded me of that I don't know if you saw I can't remember if this was a tweet or this is a video or somewhere but- I did a setup where I had I would I was pi powering, particle accelerators with just biomass burners, and I was taking advantage of the fact that when you're under under clock they consume like almost no power so I had like I underclocked like 20 or 30 particle accelerators and I had like 10 or whatever biomass burners just fueling that, so there was definitely mean potential in the current system so fans of biomass burners I will have you know you know the current system is pretty good for that so yeah but I guess we'll see, I kind of want to touch a little bit on the topic of like because because one thing that people have brought up is like would it be possible to do why not both would it be possible to have like, some sort of setting like when you start the the game to be like I want linear power consumption or I want the non-linear trade-off thingy, as an option uzu actually brought that up today as well to me, I think it could be nice I mean like having more modes to customize your play experience and the way that this is kind of turning out with these different types of players wanting one of different wanting different things from the system is that maybe that is the perfect choice for us right where you can customize how the system works for how you want to play the game one issue that I see with it and that's kind of generally with game modes is that we don't want to divide I think the community too much too much robot robot mark there we go, I think a nice thing right now when you play is that you kind of understand when other people are talking about the game like the experience that they're having you can communicate on the same level and if we if we have a lot of players playing differently with these kind of settings it's very hard to understand each other potentially with like the problems that people are facing and the things that you want to discuss gotcha within the community yeah, and- I guess maybe that's just not something that we can avoid if we want players to be able to customize experience more which is what we do want to achieve in the end I think yeah so maybe it's it's a non I mean it's maybe an issue but it's not something that maybe can be sold and something we just have to live with in the end if we want to make the best experience because like we kind of already have that right with the modern community and the people that play vanilla yeah there's already a little bit of like segregation in between like how people prefer to play the game so we'll see, because one thing I get one natural thing that comes up with that is because we're not planning to do game modes in this update we're planning to do it later down the line so you know could could this be the case where like if we if we want to pursue that then we maybe will hold off on this change and then maybe introduce it when we work on game modes or something like that or maybe I think if we feel like we want this change in some way we probably will still push it for this update gotcha like I can't say right now it's going to be completely linear maybe we're gonna reduce the exponent and just make it less harsh to make the trade-off, no still yeah cause I definitely I definitely see the improvement for new new players, I think that having like linear being sort of the base, version base like default setting for this if you will whatever like I think it makes more sense when you're starting off playing the game, you can play hardcore mode yeah sugar daddy drives yeah exactly that's the ultimate recipe for that, cool so is there anything else you want to share about overclocking specifically before you move on, I don't think so cool, what'd you have for breakfast that's the next topic, lunch lunch for breakfast oh nice me too, I don't remember what that dish is called it's like this typical swedish thing where you have these kind of potato patties with like thick slices of bacon no it's not it's chad help me is that what you're thinking of I'm not sure but that was good yeah I, since I don't eat meat I don't have it but I know what you're talking about I've never liked it no no because I never liked meat from the give me all right yeah, yeah it's a it's a weird it's a it's like sometimes I think about like what is a traditional swedish dish I can never think of it it's always like  meatballs and blood yeah whatever, yeah peter pan is like another one that came to mind but yeah it's a pretty typical classic classic swedish one that's another word for it right anyway I wouldn't know this this is what you get instead of talking about fine fancy you get to talk about weird swedish food with dutch mark yeah, I kind of wanted to touch a little bit about the, talk a little bit about spire coast, so I don't know if you say I said this in the beginning of the stream fam but the the kind of next thing that we are gonna like show off and talk more about is the spire coast because we've talked so much about it and we've given so many warnings about the spydercos but you guys have no idea what it's it what it is like you know you haven't seen anything from it apart from the the teaser that we showed in the in the last week's video, and there's a there's a few things that I kind of want to touch on with mark, regarding like you know what it actually entails by changing those barcodes because we made the choice I don't know if can you correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think we've ever changed the node layout when we made updates to the game so far we've done it a few times we have yeah so do nestor definitely because there were notes there if I'm not mistaken and we completely we did something completely different with that area so we had to change that right, I do remember that we've done it before because we have had we've had to look into what issues that would cause gotcha one big benefit that we have is that the miner knows still that it was built on a node and what note that was so if we move them anything that you build on those things will still extract in a normal way right yeah which is that that node is now in a place where it looks like it isn't being used but it actually is, already taken so you will just have a bunch of notes if you build in that area and then move your factory yeah that that appear as if they're empty but of course your your extractor is still taking resources from it and it's already taken and I believe this is- I kind of missed in the beginning if you said this is how it used in the past but I think this is kind of how it's going to work now as well right if you have placed an extractors on notes that are moved the extractor will still function, it will just look weird, and I think I think that is still true because that's that's definitely been in the past, and I think that's the whole truth for this update so you know if you have factories in the spire coasts they will sort of still function they will clip through the environment as far as I know, they just will look weird and it's possible they might be like it's possible they might be clipping into environments so you might not be able to reach them, so, I don't know if you guys have heard of you know the the tools that exist around satisfactory like save editing tools, they're gonna have to work overtime once we drop update six, because there are ways to like remove stuff, and move the stuff in those editors, to get around that stuff but, but yeah like the the notes that we have in the spire coasts at the moment like how significantly are they moving would you say quite significantly I mean they're still kind of going to be in the same area of that zone but they're just not on the same spot anymore gotcha and we kind of shuffled them around a little bit because we wanted to have the transition from the different areas around it to be a little bit different when it comes to how you you get to those nodes yeah, yeah but it's the same amount of oil note same purity so it's in that sense it's completely the same you can still get the same stuff okay so it's it's more of a move of the current nodes that are there yeah we just had to shuffle them around a bit and, because we didn't want to be, restricted by how they were placed necessarily initially we were like yeah let's try to build around them but it's just better to move them and be done with it sorry go ahead oh yeah because any anyone that has built a factory there it's gonna be anyway wait repeat that because robot mark just took over oh god I was saying that anyone who has built a factory there on those notes like the only reason for us to keep in there is to not mess up then how your factory setup looks but I mean it's gonna be anyway because you're gonna have giant cliffs straight for your buildings yeah that's true so it didn't really make sense for us to try to restrict ourselves with how we built that area because of the nodes that are placed there yeah so we just moved them, are there any do you remember this I don't know if you've stared at the old inspire coast a lot and remember how it looks but were there any crash sites in the old spire coasts,
>
> [Music]
>
> I don't think so because we specifically held off on passing it don't wait too much say that again we're losing your mark is it just getting worse now no it's not getting worse it's like it just randomly happens sometimes it's kind of yeah, no I don't think there were crash sites I can't say 100 sure there were some on the cliff wall yeah so if you if you look at spire coast and I'm looking at it right now with this map that I have, there is this canyon there between what is fire coast and what is a northern forest and that canyon from hannah's perspective that is part of spider coast it's so that k n has also changed yeah, and there were crash sites there and exploration rewards and creatures so they're gonna be fixed up, something to mention for spirecois is that we won't have the time to fully pass it, with gameplay yeah so while the notes and creatures reversal there are probably still going to be there and they're I mean the notes definitely right and the creatures are going to be moved around as well so they're not spawning inside of cliffs we're also going to do a pass on passive creatures to make the area not feel completely dead we're probably not going to have all the hostiles we want in that area there yet we're not going to have slugs or any any other exploration rewards besides crash sites there will be crash heights there and that's mostly because we don't want those crash sites to then later pop up inside of your factory, and on because you can't remove them currently right so that would be annoying but seeing as you can pick up the slugs for example we're going to just place those later because we don't have the time to do that now, something important to note as well for that is that there will be more resources later in that area like supplementary resources like more copper maybe sulfur quartz or keterium and probably a bunch of iron and again we're not placing those yet either because we need to have a deeper look in our entire at our entire resource spread across the world which is something that we also don't have time for right now so we would otherwise just place them temporarily and have to change them later probably so we don't want to do that we're just gonna face them yet and do it later all right I'm sure you said something really cool at the end there but but yeah essentially essentially there's there's more things to come with the spire coast, later than the line, not in update 6 necessarily but we're still going to keep working on it, so yeah there's going to be more info about the spire coast, you guys in a future video we also will have hannah on stream, next after that video I don't know exactly I don't know if it'll be next week over the week after we're kind of like shimmy shaming with the schedule right now so it might you never know what's gonna happen so, so yeah more more exciting things to talk about the sparkles I think you'll be more excited to talk about it too when you guys actually have seen it and get a sense of like what changes actually have happened, because it is a it is a beefy biome, that replaces like a pretty empty area I would say, previously because that that whole area like including that canyon has always felt a bit like empty, and you know a big work in progress because it has, and now it's coming so yes this is aspire gulf coast no go away maybe what shut up mark don't no don't do this he lied don't don't give them hope
>
> [Laughter]
>
> oh look what you've done can I say how much I appreciate when we did the, the premiere of the video there was a there was one segment in the video where I talked about like why we're doing the change and I what's the action I need to actually look up the phrase I say here I think I think I say something like I think I say something down a line of like we have to focus on what's best for the game not what's most exciting and chad just lit up with golf comments oh my god so yeah tropic tropical, tropical golf course sure whatever, so yeah I think let me see if there's anything else I want to bring up here
>
> [Music]

> my list has been filled out of things that I wanted to bring up so happy days yeah, I don't have anything else either anymore I think cool we have nothing interesting to citrus other nope
