> do a commodore 64 satisfactory d make I have actually made a commodore 64 game and believe me it is a pain in the ass, I would- I it was fun doing it I was super stoked about that project because it was I was I actually legit made a d make of a game for commodore 64., and, it was fun because it was like I learned a lot of stuff, but the learning process is over you know and I know how hard it is to do stuff on the commodore 64. you have to program an assembler, my favorite part was when we like put it on media like cassette tapes I like recorded on a tape recorder and just sent the I had a program that like translated into audio that was fun but no I would never want to do that again
