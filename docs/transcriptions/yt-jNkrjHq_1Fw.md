### Transcript

> the switcher here and then yeah simon did the pre, like the actual editing of it so I've got a few bts shots here from simon's mockup so we originally we this this scene went back and forth between me and simon how we wanted to do it, because we originally did just like the drones were just flying past but then we're like it's not a big reveal so we wanted them to like hover around and then we ended up with the way where like one drone like drops down and it focuses on that, and simon first blocked out the scene as like he had the footage and then he tried to like mimic it, in blender and then he like made like this is what the scene looks like in 3d and try to match it, and then at the end of it he he needed to like bring it over I know I think this is also in blender yeah this is also blender so an a3 detracted so that the camera movements matched the three animations sound popping really guys is the sound up you guys oh really, okay I have to restart stream this really sucks sorry guys, give me a visit yeah I'll be back in
