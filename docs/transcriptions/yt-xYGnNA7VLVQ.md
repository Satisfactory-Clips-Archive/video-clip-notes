> okay people keep saying that josh was god in the video he wasn't god he was close enough it was close enough it's not god just close not god yeah just close enough yeah close enough the I think the the tagline in the script is angelic voice or something like that was it angelic voice I wrote mysterious voice in the closed captions yeah I don't remember what- I don't think, see here's the little little fun fact all right josh didn't know anything about when we sent him the script I sent him like a redacted script to josh, he only knew that like this is a, like a pivotal moment in the in the patchiness video and you're giving jace a pep talk so that did he even know that I said I'm so tragic golf nope he didn't even know it was gold wow interesting I rejected golf from that he I think it was just like I'm so trash at this or something right or or I can't do this or whatever so so like even josh didn't know golf was, wasn't coming I love that it's a tragic golf I know no no you say I'm so trash yeah oh no we saw him we summoned him he's here oh god I think he's trash got it I think we also changed around the, the script a little bit because I don't think in the in in our original script that josh got it didn't say like I'm trash I think you he responded to something else and then we changed it in our version that script that script went under a lot of changes we were literally on a call the night before just like changing the script and we're like yeah we'll just memorize this on the spot tomorrow yeah we didn't by the way yeah we didn't went through five iterations before it went to shooting and then after shooting we also found a couple of issues with it and had to change it after we recorded everything yeah and add in some extra voiceovers and stuff like that but it all worked out should I play it where it lies yeah that was the last second edit there's also a part where we talk about dedicated servers and I just like cut off half of the things we were saying because we realized it didn't make sense I know hi friends I noticed like josh hello, production stories on your videos we're thinking of doing another stream about that yeah
