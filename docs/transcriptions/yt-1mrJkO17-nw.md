> any movements on the mark ii pipe uh thingamajig with uh 600 blah blah blah uh no movement no but we are gonna look into that at some point yeah it's not a small thing that can be fixed and um it most likely is not a small thing that can be fixed and it's possible that the solution for it requires touching a lot of different things and so we need to make sure that we know that we plan that out it's not it's not just a bug that we can go and fix yeah like i i know like a lot of folks kind of want that just just fix the bug uh it's not something that we can just easily fix or from what we can see it's not like that it's also possible that it's tied into something else we need to work on and then it's like now is not also the best time to do it um so yeah bear with us in the meantime
