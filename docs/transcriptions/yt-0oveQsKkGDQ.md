### Transcript

> let's see here can we get something that allows us to make full use of mark iii minor, like another output so, something we've said before a lot of times, is that, we don't know at this point maybe we'll do something about it probably maybe we'll just rebalance the game and just like everything slower but, no but that that thing that you just pointed out the fact that like you can't mine marks mark three miners to the full potential that's something that we're gonna resolve at some point but, long long story short or short story long here's the short story long right so there's two issues with the game that we need to solve one of them is like we have precision issues with our belts the way that the, sort of the the the math is calculated when belt when when items are moving in and out on belts is the lower the frame rate on your computer the the less precision the the movement on the items, make and the faster a belt goes the more important that precision is so if you're playing on a slow frame rate and you have a really fast belt you can run into issues where your factories aren't you know like 100 efficient which I guess already kind of happens right now and that's something that we need to improve in general so that's one issue the other issue is no wait that's the main issue so so that's the main issue why we just like can't add a mark vi belt we had a mark 6 belt in the game before and then we we noticed that that's a problem it's also a problem on our pipes when you have like 600 and you want to keep everything in like 600 us 100 efficiency, then because of that precision issue, with how computers work, then at lower frame rates you can get like yes I think that I think that is correct cool, you can run into issues where where you don't get like full 100 efficiency out of pipes and that's something that ties into that same problem so that's the problem we need to solve we we're aware of that issue right, and we don't have a solution right up right now but that's something that we need to look into we haven't had time to look into it yet because there's always been like something more important all the time you know like, but eventually we're gonna get around to that and you know whether we do a thing where maybe we can't add a faster mark six belt or whatever then we would you know add another output on the miner for instance, or maybe we will add a mark six belt and then we don't need to change anything with a minor but as to like what option we go with we don't know at this point so, so yeah that's that's the, that is the situation with that right now and tldr belts go burr but they're not good enough so we need to look into why they don't go burr good enough before we add that we we were very aware of that thing my belts go bird for sure
