> what would you tell the team to avoid doing in the future now that you're leaving oh wow I don't know don't try to do anything stupid I don't know it's making make a good game I try to tell myself that focus on what you should focus on those type of things right really generic no I don't know it's it's, so hard because I think that's one of the important things really is that, the team like the team believes in what they're doing, and that they themselves, like that's where I think a lot of the motivation extra effort comes from is that they believe in the plan or they believe in what they're doing with the game and I yeah as long as they they have a conversation about it with the community I think it's gonna go great was a good that was a good answer that's a really good answer- I that that's I feel like that's something that sounds obvious and straightforward but in practice it really isn't that obvious or straightforward to do, it's it's very it's really easy to get into that sort of rut where it's like, I don't know there's one fixed idea that never changes it's not malleable people just feel like they're the cog in the machine they don't really you know they just do whatever right but no if if you feel like true ownership of your own work and and vision then a lot more can come from it both like effort wise creativity
