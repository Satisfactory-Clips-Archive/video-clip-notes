> will you add more sulfur nodes I need sulfur so much and I'm almost out of nodes I think that is ah I'm not 100 sure so don't quote me on this but I think there's there's some plants that have more sulfur or if we did add more stuff with some I can't remember, but, yeah let us know on the keyword side if you feel like there's not enough is a few hidden oh do they not show up on the map when you like search for them or that'll increase the purity that could also be an option
