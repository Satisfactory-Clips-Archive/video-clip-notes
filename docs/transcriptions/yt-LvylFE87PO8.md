> how finished is the game in percentage I don't think anyone can answer that at coffee's name because we keep, adding things but that's like part of the problem right where we're we just kind of like need to get stuff done you know why why we didn't delay update six because we keep moving the goal post sort of, we just gotta we just gotta finish but, how finished I don't know like it's it's pretty finished I'd say but it's hard like how like if you okay so if satisfactory was like finished now we just want to rebalance a bunch of stuff like how how would that how would you count that you know like all the items in the game but we still need to rebalance it is it nine percent is it 100 like what if we balance the entire system you know it's kind of hard to to say and I certainly don't know what the percentage is because I actually don't know like everything we planned either so
