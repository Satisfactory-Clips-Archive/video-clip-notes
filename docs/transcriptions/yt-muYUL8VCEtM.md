> there is a lot of questions coming through i'll just give the general answer of like if you're having issues and stuff like that, the qa site questions.satisfactorygame.com is the best place to go to leave those that's where the that's where the, producers and the team go and look for, yeah feedback and bugs and stuff like that and that's where a lot of the, you know like the fixes we've done with the patches over the past week you know have come from the the team looking at the qa side so please, leave them all there you know we can take questions and stuff here a little later but ultimately it's all going to boil down to go there and post there, yeah yeah and if you're running into crashes the crash reporter that you get up and you like hit send crash like we get those, so we will like you don't need to really do anything special whenever you're into crashes sometimes maybe you can circumvent crashes like if there are workarounds and checking community if there if there are ways to do that but you don't need to do much in terms of crashes, we will get those reports and we are like you know knocking them off one by one as we're like going along with this yep yep pretty much all right
