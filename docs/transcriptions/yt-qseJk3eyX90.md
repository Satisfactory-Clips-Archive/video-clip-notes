> oh boy now we're gonna get down to the nitty-gritty the real the real meat of the the stream y'all we ready do we need an intermission do we need a little little break for get some snacks and stuff, yeah the real news I saw before what's going on with the update update eight when is update coming out water break make sure to hydrate yeah stretch we should we stretch everybody I don't need these anymore stand up do a little hoo good it'll move on oh that feels good I'm just good for my back all right all right break's over back to work what's the state of death what's this little snoot this snow it is I stretch my back I feel very stretched now, yeah state of dev what is going on in the world of development for satisfactory what's happening, there's not been not been much movement from us for the last couple of weeks what's going on talk to me tell me what's happening yeah, so, I came back from vacation last week, as you remember no wait two weeks ago maybe whatever doesn't isn't important, essentially most people go back from came back from vacation last week so, we're we're we're sort of getting back in the groove we're getting back to working on various aspects of the game and, we're working on like one of the goals that we have right now is to get update 6 out on early access essentially so that's what we're focusing on we've been we got like a tiny delay not too much, with update six we were supposed to push like a patch for experimental last week but for various reasons we got a little bit delayed and we weren't able to do that so this week this week this week, is when you can expect to see hopefully if if nothing like bad happens in the in the back the back end, with the build which can't happen happen has happened in the past, you'll see a patch for experimental where we're gonna be essentially and it's gonna be maybe a big patch because we're gonna take pretty much all the work from last patch from a while ago people have been working on some various things and we're gonna cram all that into one patch we're gonna push out today hopefully hopefully today, fingers crossed and, we'll see how buggy it is because this, it's been a while since we pushed a patch, you know we have we have our own like internal qa, that are doing qa on like testing the game and stuff, but you know qa can only do so much unfortunately like the the real meat is when we actually push stuff on experimental so, we're curious as to see what, what the actual state of the game is because we we don't really know until the patch is live like and that's kind of the nature of like game development in general, unless you're doing a vast amount of testing, so so but we're the the goal is essentially to to start like rolling out patches on experimental and try to sort of wrap up, where we are with update six as of now and, yeah get it out to early access essentially, if you weren't here last week when I talked a little bit about some some things that we already know at this point is oh yeah nice now I see that ccs are working, they didn't work last week I hope they work when jace was here, somebody pointed out to me that the, the the closed captions didn't work last stream so got that working again apparently, anyways, so ea is not happening this week no and, but we are we're gonna roll out patches on experimental again and hopefully fix a couple of things, I don't know the exact state of things as of now like sort of what is being what has been fixed and you know like there's a there's a bunch of potential fixes so there's there's a bunch of potential fixes for, dedicated servers with foliage, I don't believe we've fully resolved the extractor bug but we might have I'm not exactly sure what the state of that one is, but the the foliage like issue that people have been having on dedicated servers that one has a potential fix but since we haven't been able to like roll out the patch we don't actually fully know we only have like a theoretical theoretical solution for it so to speak sometimes when we are fixing issues we can't reproduce it ourselves so we just have to like try and like theorize like what could be the cost, and that's sort of one of the cases for for the footage fix for dedicated servers so that's probably gonna be part of the next coming patch, and there's probably a bunch of other fixes we've been working on on creatures, one thing that I mentioned last week as well was that you know we had we had a little bit grander ideas for creatures back in the day or like back before when we started working on them for update 6 and sort of the the work on creatures and like the rework of like the system behind creatures as well which isn't just like the ai itself it's also like how the navigation system works, like how we sort of store the ai behaviors and stuff like that on the build and stuff like that, that that like progression of that system and all that like re-haul of that system essentially, took a bit longer than we expected and then there's also like the notion of you know once we finish the overhaul of the ai system and the behavior system then then implementing ai is like a huge task and it takes a lot of tweaking and it's it's something that just like takes a long time to to wrap up so, that also took a bit longer than we expected so we've we've, we've, we had like ideas of like where we wanted the creatures to be for update six on early access, but we feel like we're not gonna be able to reach that and if we're gonna delay the entire update just to so us for us to be able to reach like that like point where we want it for creatures we feel that that's probably not the best way to go right now so we're gonna like wrap up creatures we have been working on like some of the known issues like with how creatures spawning and and that some creatures are very docile and stuff like that, so that kind of stuff we have been working on and that's gonna be rolling out in the next couple of patches and, but yeah there's more there's more work for creatures essentially like what I'm trying to say here is we had the aspirations to sort of wrap up creatures to the like 1.0 quality that we sort of wanted you know we we wanted to like make the changes the creatures that we wanted and then say okay this is the quality of creatures that we expected to be for like the final release of the game and that was the thing we wanted to come up with x6 early access but we feel like we probably need more time with creatures actually so we're not going to put the 1.0 stamp on creatures just yet we're going to roll out the current iterations of creature development for update six and then later down the line we're gonna keep working on them and release them in some other form so so that's the state of creatures at least so but we should be able to fix like most of the the known issues creatures that we're having right now you know for instance that like I mentioned that creatures get like just look and stop and stare at you and stuff like that and get stuck and that kind of stuff or not spawning and stuff like that so so that should be rolling out in the next couple of patches there's been a lot of movement on the on the creature, development as of late so hopefully you guys will be able to see that and test it out and see you know what actually got resolved and, what we need to keep working on essentially and from from that you know I think from from your feedback not like and this is not just for creatures but I think overall for the build I think we're gonna get a better picture of like how much work is left before we can push it out on ea, because we kind of need that feedback we kind of need to know like where we are where we stand before we can even like estimate like roughly like when we think we're gonna be able to push out the the final like update six version to ea or not the final but the the one that goes out the stable version of update six essentially, so that's that's what we're focusing on the next couple of weeks and I don't think it will take like too long but it will take a couple more weeks I think you know you can you can expect a couple more weeks but, I'd say you know update six should be on early access sometime in september, unless like unless we get really like something we didn't realize or you know something really bad goes down I don't know but that's that's the, that's that's the news as of now, update six sometime in september might be mid might be late might be I don't know as soon as possible as soon as we can essentially is the goal that's why we can't like give a date today because we don't really fully know where we stand because we really need that feedback in like that experimental, patch a couple of patches on experimental to like get a better understanding of like how much work is left, so yeah soon soon soon essentially yeah exactly, so that's where we stand with update six, and yeah as for like what we do after update six it's kind of like still, we also need to sort of figure that out ourselves you know if we I think I mentioned this in the last stream as well but like what the next step is if we're going to keep like iteratively working on the game up until we feel we can release the content that we made for 1.0 or if we should have another patch not patch if we should have another update in between, then like then and now if there should be an update seven or not that's sort of, still a little bit we're trying to figure that out trying to figure that out ourselves because we sort of, I guess this I guess this is a general problem in game dev but you know we've we've been trying to narrow down the scope of what we want the game to be at and what quality we wanted to be at and and you know what other elements are in the game that we haven't had yet, and that is tricky like I feel like we're constantly being surprised at how hard it is to nail down what we want satisfactory 1.0 to consist of

> and it's something that we've been working on while we've been working update six so last week I sort of did like a powerpoint not a power a pain presentation where I should sort of showed off like you know the different, the different, development branches that we have, not to be construed as a road map because it definitely wasn't a road map just want to make that perfectly clear it was not a road map okay I think people that were watching the stream knew that but I think when people shared it like elsewhere it got a little bit confusing so, import yeah branch strategy exactly so but the the main point of that what I wanted to get out of the way is essentially that you know while we were working update 6 like we've also been working on on a lot of other stuff that didn't go into update six that we intend to put in the game later down the line, and it's just it's based on the fact that in between updates there's only so much time that we can work on stuff so up until now we always focus on like what can we do in between that time frame and that's sort of what the entire studio is working on now we sort of split it up so that like some people are working on what we can do for the next update like what goes into update six and other parts of the studio been working on what takes a bit more time but we intend to put in the game later down the line, so that's that's stuff like you know whatever we do with the story you know whatever is tied to 1.0 release whatever content we haven't unveiled yet you know stuff like that so you know there's there's been a lot of like cool development that we haven't been able to show yet and probably won't be able to show for quite some time unfortunately but there's also like a bunch of development that's going on that we are going to talk about, that's coming after update six that goes into update six yada yada, so what I'm trying to say essentially like tldr there's a lot of development going on right now some is for update six some is for later down the line and right now some of us are focusing on getting like the final kind of push for update six like I think I think, update six we sort of done a feature freeze for update six in a sense so like what you see in updates today is mostly what you're gonna get on early access there might be a couple of tweaks here and there, I know that we're working on some some like it to the atmosphere system and some changes to yeah like I mentioned the creatures I think that's been the biggest, like thing that we were working on so, so yeah and like like I mentioned the next patch that we intend to put out on experimental should hopefully happen today fingers crossed but I feel like I feel like it's a stream curse whenever I say that the next patch we intend to put out is going to go out today it never happens and and mostly the reason for that is like because of the our build server or like the the we found some issue with the build that we felt like ah it's not worth putting out on experimental,
>

> so we will see okay we will see, if it goes out I think it will go out a bit later today, so, so yeah I think I think that's the state of dev yeah who broke the ci pipeline again, it's kind of we're kind of stoked because we finally have someone that can like work on the that the builds server, like someone can dedicate time to do nothing but work on the build server which is we're pretty stoked about that pretty happy that that's finally a thing because it's always been like it's always been a divided task between the programmers so sort of like the bill is broken again god damn it okay who fixes this you do you do it okay cool I'll do it, but now we finally have someone working like full time on that stuff so that's great but it's probably we probably won't see like the full effect of that until like a lot like in the future sometime because it's it's a huge system like it's there's a lot that goes into that, you don't just push a button and then a build pops out of the engine right there's a lot that goes into it and it takes a while too it takes like I mean the whole process is sort of you know because it has to go through like once we have like the build that we intend to put out it has to go through our qa and be like okay well are there any like what's the word there's we do, there's a word for this like just making sure that nothing's on fire you know, making sure that from a quick glance that you know there are no merging smoke test that's the word I'm looking for smoke test do like a quick smoke test making sure that you know this is something that isn't embarrassing to put out like there's been a couple of cases where we put out a patch and then like there's an obvious crash like if you pull up the bill gun the game crash is like how do we not notice that, so it goes through a smoke test and then we have to go through the whole rigmarole of uploading it to steam and epic which is, and flipping them live which is a very stressful part of the process, and then you guys can download it and play it and that whole rigmarole can take a whole day, you know, so, yeah so that's that's the plan right now we're hoping to get a patch out as soon as possible on experimental you guys can try it out tell us what's wrong what isn't wrong maybe some maybe we actually did some good this time if we actually fixed it and if you are running into any issues make sure to use the keyway site questions.satisfactorygame.com to let us know what you're running into and, boom good times will be had by all I think that state of death have I forgotten something

> bring up the sign again yeah yeah let me go back to that slide, yeah y'all remember don't make me hit the sign remember to go to the keyway site if you're on anything issues cool that's state of dev I think I think that's a good summary of what's going on I think the most yeah the the patches are gonna come come come rolling back and we'll take it from there essentially like based on based on how that goes that's when we'll decide what we do next essentially
