> your thoughts on logic implementation on the game, I think it would be cool I don't know where I cause like it is a bit complex and I think like I think one there's like two things here right when it comes to logic system for our game, it can it can open up a lot of like possibilities with our game, you make a lot of cool stuff because like part of satisfactory is really all about like tinkering you know and and you know being able to to set up whatever you want and do like can I abstract changes of your systems and stuff like that because like there's nothing that says like you have to play satisfaction in a certain way and we certainly haven't designed it that way, but, but you know if if you add like a logic system and and we also want to cater in like you know that the rest of the game loom makes sense for that, then we also need to like strike a balance between what, what we kind of add to the game and doesn't like enforce it to people you know, because if if we make something that's like too difficult to maintain when it comes to logic system then I think people would be a little bit discouraged so I think we need probably need to like draw a fine line and I see panna cotta in chat here too panna cot has made like a huge mod for logic systems in the game and I think that like sort of shows you know the deep end of of a logic system because you can do a lot of that stuff in that mod and I don't think we would like go that deep if we were to implement a logic system, I think we would sort of need to find like middle ground, for like what makes sense in our game because it is it is like in other games where they have logic systems like it's really easy to get kind of like caught up in in the difficulty in those kind of systems and it's it's like for the people that want that that's a great addition but we always have to like sort of you know rationalize between everything we add to the game that makes sense for the entire game so, so yeah long story short I think it would be cool but it's also hard to say what be it would be a good like balance, I think so, yeah
