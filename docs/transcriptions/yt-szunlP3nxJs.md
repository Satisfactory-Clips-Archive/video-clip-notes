> the expensive part of showing like fluid in pipe is that you need to if you if you want to have like you know actual fluid motion and stuff like that they need to simulate it and doing fluid simulation is really expensive, computing wise, you know there's obviously other ways we could do it but you know like out of the options that we came up with we felt that that pipe indicator was the best one because it doesn't lead into like if we did like shitty flumid fluid simulation people were just like why didn't you just do proper fluid simulation make it look good you know here at least it looks like a conscious like effort to make it look that way coffee cup is the most accurate fluid simulation yeah exactly I think the fluid animation actually is just animation it's not actually simulating anything in the cover or I know that it's like that it's not a guess it's all pre-made or what's it called offline

> computed based on momentum, it's based on momentum in like in in terms of like how we animate how it animates
