> something totally different what do you enjoy most of your job I think I've thought about this a lot, and I keep changing the answer but I think my favorite part of my job is seeing people, what's a two-parter right because in my role as a community manager you know I interact with a lot of the content creators that around our game they interact with a lot of people that are making content with our game and I think my favorite part is like people making stuff out of our game so whether that's YouTube videos or memes on our Discord or, you know whatever it is like making content out of our game and that that notion in itself I think is super cool, I also think it's super cool I think it was something that we sort of sort of knew about we didn't fully grasp and realize until me and Jace went to twitchcon where you know there are people that have legit made careers out of making content out of our game, and you know maybe they didn't start making didn't start their career by working like using our game to to stream or make YouTube content or whatever but it's been like a big part of it and I think that notion in itself is so cool and I think that that's like one of my favorite parts of my role specifically is that like I've been sort of trying to nurture that ability for people to be able to do that and at the end of the day it's still like the streamer and the YouTuber or the contact Creator or whatever who sort of did it like it's their journey and they're the ones that are people tuning in for I'm just glad that we get to be a part of that journey and be able to like nurture that that relationship because it's I think it's very very beneficial for everyone you know like it's beneficial like for a streamer for both us because we get to Market our game it's great for the streamer because you know people know what satisfactory is whatever and they get to join in and then oh this is a cool streamer and then twitch gets money because of so like it's such a big big win-win-win-win, so I think that that is is one of my favorite parts of my role specifically, there's there's been just so much like positivity than growing from from our community in general and it's hard to, to not enjoy the ride you know what I mean, so I think that's that's one of my favorite Parts like being able to like support people making stuff with our game yes
