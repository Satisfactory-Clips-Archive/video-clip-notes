> ziz X TV any thoughts on reducing megabase building TDM or is that lower priority limit it's really interesting that you you asked that question because this is something that we've talked about, many times before before zooping was introduced to the game where we said, you know like we can add Mass construction of some kind or something some sort of feature to help that you know if you want that but it's only going to move the goal posts you know like we said it back then that like if you can if you can build quicker it just means you'll build bigger but you'll still like a megabase will still be really big you'll just build more if you can build quicker right and So eventually you're going to reach a point where you're like oh I wish I could build even quicker because I'm it's taking so long to build something it just moves the goal posts yeah and like we literally so we just added zooping in update five I believe it was, and so you know like just a year ago and it's and it's interesting that you asked that question because it doesn't really matter what we do like we added zooping and you will still have that feeling I'm not saying like the feelings are valid but it's like people will still always have that feeling of can it be less tedious, I don't think there's anything we can do to remove that feeling permanently without destroying our game, so let's destroy the game yeah it like like that's not to say we can't it's not to say we can't do anything like maybe we can do more right but like I don't think we'll ever get rid of that feeling no, yeah I definitely think there's a lot of stuff we can improve in terms of like the general, like the the build mechanics that we have, I think I think like sometimes small changes can make like a huge difference as well like the for instance the fact that like our lifts never have a consistent rotation you know like when you're building a lot of lifts you constantly have to like fight the game a little bit Yeah like stuff like that I think can can can do big improvements as well yeah, and it's it's like a question of us scanning around to like looking into that more because I like working on so many other things at the same time so it's like it's always like so many things that we want to do and so many things that are requested so it's like hard to, get around to everything
