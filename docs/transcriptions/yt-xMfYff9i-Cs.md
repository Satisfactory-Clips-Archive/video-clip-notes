> difficult to do with that chase yeah so so let me talk about mods, because somebody asked about this when mark were here and i i i want to make like the most what's the term make the most out of mark's time when he's here because mark, that doesn't need mark doesn't know about that he doesn't care about that stuff but so mods for satisfactory the mod modders are working on mod support we don't have official mod support for the game, but we we try to help out the modders as much as we can and, they are working on it as far as i know they're very confident that it's gonna be available next week when it comes to early access there was something they reached out to us about with this saving system or something i'm quite sure if we were able to help them there we're done we waited for a safe fix yeah so i'm not quite sure what the state of that is, actually but, yeah modern working on it and somebody asked like do we do we condone mods and i'm like yo of course we're of course we condone mods we don't have official mod support because we don't have the capacity right now to like being able to like dive into it and help out as much as we can and then be able to support the build pipeline and all that jazz because that's all set up but the mod makers right now, of course we don't contain yeah they don't condone us so why would why would we condone the mod makers, but we of course we support mods we love mods, we have i don't know why we i understand why we get this question sometimes because sometimes it sounds like people are wondering it's like do you want to shut down mods i guess maybe some studios have that approach i don't know i don't understand why you wouldn't want to have mods supported for your game it feels kind of like at least to me personally it feels very like, given but i guess some studios are just like against that i can understand it when it's like competitive, games where like it's pvp and and you know mods can give you an advantage but that's not the case for us certainly, so i don't know i don't i i don't quite understand why some studios are against that we're super we love it we love our modding community even we wish we could help them up more but you know we have limited amount of resources
