### Transcript

> wouldn't be better to name it 6.2 see that's something we actually discussed a bit the problem with the up like the fluid update was that it was confusing for people like what it was and we did have a discussion whether we should actually call it update seven or not but like in the end you know it is an update to the game like it is it's the seventh update to the game in a sense you know why I think too much about it, because like the important thing really is that we just set expectation of what's coming in it and I think we are doing that and I think we did that for update six as well because like update 6 was also a small update and that should also been a you know just a random update name so- I think I think it's just like less confusing yeah 0.6.2 exactly like it's, it's confusing no matter what we do you know in a sense and just let's just try to be consistent instead I think it's more important to be consistent than trying to like figure out the best solution for everything if that makes sense don't do a USB USB confusing as hell yeah missed opportunity for update 6.9 we would need to do like eight more updates to the game though like it's too much work we did get, 420 though did we or for two we got for 2.0 right back you know we'll take that one

> did jump to 3.5 yeah but that was because we made five like updates two update three we made more than that like a lot of people think it's like semantic versioning isn't that it's it's not a decimal value it's like it's two integers so you have like major minor, I forgot it again major minor patch and then build number and then you just increment the number of what type of update it is and we've sort like we're not 100 like doing exactly how some versioning works because there's a bunch of like I mean it's a lot more well documented we're sort of doing our own thing it's also because we're in Early Access and we don't think it's clear to just communicate that like we're only making minor updates because they are my major updates in a sense, and you know we don't have any well to a certain degree like the the mods we do have to you know a little bit of, dependency on us there but for the most part you know we just kind of do what we think kind of makes sense, with the version numbering so it's close to Silver but it's not really we a community can call it six yeah 6.9 no matter what you call it that's fair that's up to you follow your dreams it's going to be super confusing though like if the week is going to be like update seven also known as 6.9 like which one's 6.9 what stops you from update 8 to update XP to update 11. well first of all we're not Microsoft that's the biggest one
