> all the answers that we have uh one quick thing i just want to address real quick maybe someone usually someone clips this kind of stuff but i've been getting a lot of people uh contacting me about a crash people are getting in multiplayer that's tied into something like called like reliable uh overflow buffer or something like that and we've looked at it and we identified that it's something with mods so if you're earning to that issue it's a bit problematic because if you it's something to do with like milestones getting duplicates in in one or multiple mods or the combination of mods or something and the problem is that once that problem persists it gets saved in the save file so even if you uninstall the mods the problem will still persist and it's it's unfortunately nothing we can do about it at this point but i have poked the mona community and uh hopefully they will look into a solution to it but as of now uh there's nothing really we can do about that stuff uh shame on you for downloading mods or something i don't know we love the mods yeah so but stuff like but yeah it essentially brings back the thing where like you can on your own if you start installing mods and are having issues uh that we can't really do much about because we do have checks for that in the original game but apparently those aren't like they're circumventing them somehow um so yeah
