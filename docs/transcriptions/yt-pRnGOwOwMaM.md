### Transcript

> what if i use jump pads now though i don't know megalian don't ask difficult questions that's a good question actually actually do the entire path i mean i think i think what would end up happening is if you did that um you might end up because the jump pads are probably not completely deterministic you might end up with like your vehicle trying to hit the jump pads it doesn't quite hit them and in fact when they're not simulating physics they won't even hit the jump pads but if they did and they didn't hit their um waypoints you'd probably have to wait a lot of time for it to continually nano machine up to these waypoints that are up in the air i think that's probably what would happen i can't wait to see that in a videos on the internet soon uh i wanted to drop update five that's gonna be fun
