> uh all type in the game causes my video driver to crash uh not happening wordless i rem i feel like i've read that on the steam post somebody managed to figure out why that happens uh but i believe that's right say that again what was it what was it uh when all tapping the game uh it costs it crashes the game or the computer i believe we have fixed that i don't know if that's the thing we fixed for update five or instead of thing that's fixed that might need to be revisited um we'll see when update 5 hits that because i believe we have fixed that it's just like internally fixed um but there yeah like you said there are workarounds if you use borderless mode for now make sure to uh check the qa side and check the steam forms if anyone's managed to figure out that issue if it's a driver thing or something else in the meantime
