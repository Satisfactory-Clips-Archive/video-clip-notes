### Transcript

> recipes subject to change again surprisingly the update allowed me to make my box at aluminium stuff 600 efficient yeah, that was intentional and we felt like bauxite specifically was too expensive, there are going to be more recipe changes in the future it's, very hard for us to know right now what those changes will be, just because you know game design is such a house of cards where you you do one thing and that affects something else so it's it's really tricky to know all the time we're pretty happy with most things I think so I don't think we're gonna rebalance much like up to tiers seven and eight, but you know if we add more equip like if you have if we add more, research tiers or whatever or you know more stuff within the tears themselves then maybe some recipes will break and then we need to rebalance them so really hard to say but I think you can expect some balance changes but as as always we try to communicate as fast as early as we can when we know that we're going to change something we try to communicate what changes we're doing so that you guys have time to prepare for it, so that it doesn't become as disruptive you know as pa like try to mitigate that as much as we can but but you know the game is in early access so we have to sort of we have to work on the game yeah so yeah
