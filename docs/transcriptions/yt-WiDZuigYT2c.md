> will we always have sky factories where we need to figure out how to build more on the ground uh i mean you can build wherever you want right uh so you don't have to have skyfactory if you don't want to but if you sort of mean is there going to be like uh stability kind of like structural support kind of thing where you need to make sure that everything is you know the structural integrity is sound or whatever and whatever you're building uh i don't think we're adding that to the game so uh if you want to have sky factories i think you you can continue having them in the future yes you don't need to worry about that
