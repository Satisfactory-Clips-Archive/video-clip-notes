> if there's many to add rtx smith that's for you yeah wait is this though before i say that if there's anything i learned from from clean energy is that it's so much more resource demanding than just going oh there's chocolate wood in the block what was it rtx planning to add rtx, like anything can happen like i don't think we will but nothing's impossible right but it's not on our prior list at all if you know what i mean like there are so many other, rendering improvements we can make with the game we don't want to slap on like this expensive ass rendering technique, that's just kind of like it'll be nice for the people that can run it but like right now a lot of people are having issues running the game because it's so rendering intense yeah so i don't i don't i don't like maybe for shits and giggles but, that happened in a while yeah it is one of those things that is, you know if you if you balance the costs what the verse reward or whatever it is, it is it is like a very small portion of people will get a an experience that really isn't going to change we wouldn't even change the game for them that much right it looks better and that's it, it doesn't really add that much more and a lot of people won't even be able to have it at all and it's not easy to add i just saw that comment it's not easy because you need to maintain if you do add it the the biggest thing about that is maintaining it on the wide platform which is like all the issues that comes with it so, and that's really expensive that's expensive already with the game as it is no you just go to edit preferences rtx support what do you say it's just that easy what is it from the ua5 it just works that's the one it just works if anyone ever says it just works in tech run the other way yeah yeah i hate that i hate it it never just works it just works if you were the person who made it like it never just works yeah it's like it's like unreal engine you know you can you can export to like linux or whatever or console it's there you can just do it just works no it doesn't doesn't just work if it's the default, game yeah if you open up the like a demo project from unreal engine yeah yeah it just works maybe but even then this like they legit say even then they don't support everything in the default scenes like the the vehicle system and whatnot they they don't support that on all platforms and whatever the only time i know my gp and my gpu fans work is when i play satisfactory

> the only thing that just works is physics yeah yeah below the checkbox enable manage magic no honestly the only thing that just works is like the one where like you be able to stand on another pawn in unreal engine yeah that take boxes [ __ ] magic yeah that actually was actually hard to do, there was a good thing where is it, is is the bunny hopping on conveyor belts the super speed thing intentional, i don't i don't know if it was like intentional per se but i don't think it's something that we would like consciously remove you know yeah i mean it was it was intentional we we tried it like oh it works doing like this and then we i think we nerfed it a little bit to be honest well, because it used to be way more powerful but we we have like we have seen it and we were like yeah it's intentional but the bunnyhop like boost thing a lot of people are like oh is this a bug like no we worked hard getting that in there yeah
