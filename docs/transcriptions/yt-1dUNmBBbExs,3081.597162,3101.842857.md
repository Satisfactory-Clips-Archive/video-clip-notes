> hey everyone my name's jase i'm a community manager at coffee stain studios and today i thought i'd do something a little bit special because as you may know as i've said before the entire team is on vacation and so there's nothing really new but what i thought would be kind of cool is if i shared uh a segment of a stream that we did a few weeks ago based on unofficial mods that the community has created so i'm basically just going to take that chunk with a tiny bit of editing and just put it at the end of this video so it's going to be pretty long but there's a lot of cool mods that people have made and so while it's not new content from us this might still be interesting stuff for you guys that you can go and check out yourselves as well so we i'm going to put links in the in the description below and i urge you to to watch the whole stream and look at what uh it's mostly snoot who shows off what's going on okay so what i will quickly do just before we get into the to the stream section of the video is just do a quick uh frequently asked questions section people are still asking these questions uh everywhere every day so um i'll answer them real quick so uh why have there been no updates is the game dead no we're on vacation when is update four gonna come out don't know we're on vacation what's gonna be in it oh no we're on vacation so we haven't figured it out dedicated servers what are they going to come out don't know we're on vacation uh however i do know that we're going to pick up production on them when we get off vacation put a little bit more prior priority on it uh now that we're not doing a big update like the steam update was but they're gonna take some time will dedicated servers be part of update four no dedicated servers will be its own separate thing once it's done we're gonna put it out or if it's an experimental version we're gonna put it out right away it doesn't need to wait for an update for right uh and then the last thing is merch a lot of people asking about merch and yeah we might actually have merch to show off next week so that's gonna be cool and i'm uh keeping an eye out for the package and once we do i'll probably either show it off on stream or in a video or both oh one more thing uh if you have bugs questions suggestions to report please do so at questions.satisfactorygame.com if you dm me with them that's cool i guess i can get an idea of what's going on but i can't get that to the team they're on vacation but even if they weren't i can't keep running and telling people someone asked for this someone asked for this there's this bug right otherwise i would do nothing but annoy people all day so it's best to go to that website questions.satisfactorygame.com because when you make your posts there it sits there and our directors our producers our programmers and all that kind of stuff they check that site and they get a good idea of what's important so please do that time for the stream let's go before before so so this is a this is a two-parter of this whole thing right because i don't just want to like show up like you're a bunch of cool mods without like acknowledging just how much [ __ ] work that went into uh uh like getting mods working whatsoever how much work work has gone into like supporting mods in general but also like setting up like this whole [ __ ] ecosystem of like both wrapping around like how you access mods if you're developing mods yourself and also like making sure that people can get mods it is an easy way so there's there's a lot to it so i'm just going to start by showing off the mod mod manager i'm going to i'm going to mix these up 50 billion times so essentially how do you get mods right that's that's probably the first question to answer um and you go to this website called fixing.app uh so from here this has been where they've been distributing mods from the get-go kind of like since we've had mods from the guinea and yeah this is where you get the mod manager which is
>
> [Music]
>
> really nice it's a really nice way to get mods you don't even need to like go to the website once you have the mod manager uh to like download and load mods and whatever and you don't even need to like [ __ ] like you need to install them but you don't actually uh need to because everything is managed in the mod manager uh so it's really neat so like you download the mod manager and then like you can browse the mods and be like yeah i want to get all the mods and i can look at like oh this looks cool apparently uh 16k where was it 16k um on the modding community there's 16k members i don't think that's on the website or on the discord so but anyway 16 000 people noise yes yes um why people laughing did i miss something because i recruited uh i i realized i didn't set up the sound so i didn't actually but yeah so so so so you can open up the mod mag and be like here's here's a cool mod uh passive oh wait oh my gosh switchback here's a cool mod like passive mode and and then it opens up like this extra branch and it shows like some like here's what the mod is about or like you can go here and be like here's the huge storage thingamajig really cool and stuff like that um so so even with the mod manager you can just browse and like check for mods itself uh it's really dope and you can like search like i want i want uh faces only fans jace oh there's not a jace mod too bad bummer um so yeah really cool and the thing about this as well is like there's there's there's kind of like a few more systems behind the scenes as well i've made i've made a diagram check this [ __ ] out let's see if i can find it boop um such a nerd dude i know right this is high school this isn't powerpoint this is a satisfactory all right so so the way it works right is that uh for to be able to like load mods and wait let me just hold up i'm i'm deviating from my own notes there's something in in the behind the scenes it's called the satisfactory mod loader which is like the system that like loads mods into the game itself um and that's also like the version like that keeps track of like being able to like access stuff in the game through the mod uh because for the longest time like it was kind of like closed off and that's that's what kind of like happens when we don't have official mod support yet is that you can't like access stuff in the game yet uh but because they made this [ __ ] thing uh and i'm trying to find the documentation for here we go right so so like there's a bunch of stuff that you need to like set up in order to like act to be able to make a mod right and and i just want to quickly run through that because just to show how much work there is behind the scenes for this right uh so first of all there's something called the mod bootstrapper which is like the thing that they they use to like access functions in the game to be able to like access unreal engine specific things um or you know be able to like access the r are the code that we've written so they can access like loading uh the same functions that we do and that's the bootstrapper and that's kind of like in behind the scenes running and then you have the mod loader which takes the like uses the bootstrapper to like access the stuff and and it handles like unpacks and unpacks the mods etc and then if you want to make your own mod you have to like download uh both the version of v-wise that we're using the audio engine you have to download like a special branch of unreal ending that they the modders have created that you can download on epic's github page um you need like your ide and blah blah like there's just so much work that goes on uh that's been set up just so that you can make mods and this is essentially the different like the different components to it right so you have like your different mods are loaded into sml which is then loaded into the bootstrapper that injects into the game um and then you have the satisfactory mod manager that handles all this behind the scenes and that also downloads and uh and handles it from the satisfactory mod repository this is the fixit app website a lot of stuff um and it blows our minds that that somebody wanted to set this up first of all uh but also like how far people have gotten so far it's gotten like so nice to use kind of thing it's really good yeah and it's it's really conv yeah that as well like it's so convenient to use like it you don't even need to like do do the classical thing of like yeah i'm going to download this mod and like place it in the folder like no you don't do that so so i'm going to show that later in the stream because i want to make sure that uh i don't like load in a mod that will crash the because i have a lot of mods loaded in right now and uh some mods don't jive with other mods for instance and i don't know which ones do um so yeah essentially you you pick and choose your mods you like find this model i want to try this out and uh you download it by clicking on it and then when you feel like i got everything you press launch game and uh it boots up the game it loads in the mods and you just play and the mods are in the game and that's pretty much it so simple yeah it just works it just works it is kind of to me it's kind of magic one other thing that i think is really cool that we tested that i didn't know this had but some mods also support multiplayer um and if you try to connect to a game that's running uh a modded version you'll get like a pop-up in the other one saying like oh this player is using a modded version and you can't connect to them even though you haven't like installed anything uh i that's magic i don't know if we helped out with that or something or if that's we'll just say yeah yeah okay i'll just better call out black screen mod yeah but i was so surprised when i saw that so here we go booting up the game bam and then you have like here it says like bootstrapper uh and then you have 19 mods loaded and you can see the mods that you've loaded in um and then you just go man you're just gonna have a sick this works it just works so here i have a save file that i've prepared with a bunch of mods that we're gonna go through and good times will be had by all uses a standard pop-up with custom disconnect message that that sounds reasonable i i assume that's what how it was done but i didn't know it it was so sm it would be so smooth i might need to
>

>
> download more ram try to download more fps
>
> [Music]
>
> yeah we don't need like on twitch it looks like okay honestly oh okay maybe it's just streaming it looks garbage on whereby yeah maybe it's just streamlines being weird um all right so before we we showcase anything the first mod that i've loaded up here is called the pack utility mod which is essentially like your cheat board right so it just gives you access to a bunch of like sheets um so yeah so you can use the the chat module in in the game to like access a bunch of commands and you can like uh you can like get items or make yourself invincible or you know stuff like that uh though the one command that i use the most is fly and this is something that we use internally as well a lot um where you like hover around uh which makes like building a lot faster find vehicles yeah this is this is your flying window right here excuse me what's your radio tower called uh don't worry about it
>
> [Laughter]
>
> um so yeah this is just a bunch of stuff you can no clip you can like get no power like you can get um infinite power quantum quote like so you don't have to to generate any power um you can teleport you can save locations in the map and there's just a bunch of nifty commands uh and right now i'm just running the uh uh i think i'm not running no power i should be yeah i disciple powersheets so so i'm running fly on no power right now just to demonstrate this is a bit faster um so yeah what's the one monster name this mod's name is pac utility mod and it's vr um so first of all uh there's something called the the more factory mod uh which is it adds like a bunch of features like a bunch of cosmetic stuff to the game uh so it gives you this like extra build menu uh build menu where you can access like a bunch of more stuff and this is what i've used to like build this thing and like added this thing and uh yeah there's just a bunch of stuff in here there's like doors like a better look at the thing that you built you just kind of like zoomed right by it yeah so like we'll get a bunch of looks because i've built a bunch of stuff here uh but it's got like this great powers there yeah big-ass radio power that's also more mod i think uh i'm kind of mixing probably going to mix up the mods a bit uh because some things are in more factory some things are in the other mods uh like the decoration mod etc but there's just a bunch of stuff you can add like here's a there's a big old fan you can add as a window that's cool and they they have like animations and [ __ ] uh let me show let me show you real quick one of the cooler ones uh that i saw when i was surprising the silo one this guy this one's got like full on
>
> [ __ ]
>
> like when it boots up boom and it runs its own i don't know damn dude damn has been fired yeah and i think like you can connect yeah you can connect like conveyor belts to this cool this is just massive storage yeah i think so i haven't tried it out yet but uh it looks like it i think it is a big fan big fan uh more lag please love it three fps all right so the the fragrance really bad for them can you like i don't know like is there anything you can do i
>
> [Applause]
>
> all right so yeah there's just a bunch of cool stuff in in in this thing and it's it's interesting because like it's a it's a piece of equipment you equip and that gives you access to like all this stuff so it's just a bunch of extra stuff so i have like an antenna that like runs i think i think this runs animation as well yeah it does it's like booting up here i'm not quite sure what this uh is used for but it looks cool cause you hook it up with power and everything is that texture the uh standard engine texture on the base no it looks like the the the yeah it looks like it right yeah yeah it is no shade that's fine just no [ __ ] yeah just looking oh look while also looking like it's amazing i have like a hog here so that's a perfect opportunity to showcase this the [ __ ] rocket launcher oh we do have one huh yeah uh it doesn't look amazing now because the [ __ ] resolution is dog [ __ ] or like i'm running in in a super nintendo but you can essentially use this like clear out a whole [ __ ] forest oh really yeah like oh my god there you are guys so everyone this is true yeah this is how to clear it up fast it's because potato power and that one is just called like rocket launcher that's a separate mod uh but yeah more factory like what time is it yeah so so there's just a lot of it here um there's a lot of cosmetic stuff and there's a lot of cool uh things like i think my favorite thing in this are the doors let me showcase this i have one here so like when you approach these they like slide open oh yeah a lot of people have been suggesting those as well yeah it's so cool yeah it's really cool and like it's also solves like the issue with doors in general when like the they'll like physically [ __ ] up because doors are [ __ ] hard to make in games in general uh but having a sliding one it solves that problem so it's really nice um so yeah another really neat mod that's not part of more factors as a separate one is this thing which i think we're going to add this to the game but having slanted uh fences here yeah i think that's something we're gonna add i'm pretty sure we just haven't gotten around to it but there's a mod for it in the meanwhile so you can check that out while you're missing uh but yeah i don't know to some degree i don't want to like showcase too much because i also want people to like download this and try it out themselves if they want to explore themselves uh but this is a really cool mod there's even a [ __ ] crane here look at this [ __ ] it's amazing oh yeah that's so cool um so yeah i highly recommend this mod because it's really sweet um again saying where's the tony hawk's pro skater mod where you can grind that sick rail
>
> [Laughter]
>
> what do you what do you mean mod update yeah yeah exactly it's already in there um all right so let's talk about uh the next one that i want to talk about here is the mark plus plus mod which is essentially it takes uh the regular factory buildings and it like makes them more uh optimized essentially so like there's like mark two mark three mark four constructors just makes them faster they just build faster so that's what i've got set up right here which is a bunch of mark twos i believe uh i don't know if you see the 16.75 yeah so just better buildings and there's one for like everyone i believe like mark yeah there's smelters and foundries and whatnot um one thing uh one more i just glanced over real quick but i just want to go through here this is a mod called the ghost mod or ghost factory ghost construction is the name of it um i i we've talked about this a bit internally doing something like this but we've never really committed to it we kind of have this for when you're playing uh multiplayer and um it's lagging this feature is kind of in the game but essentially what it is is when you're building factories you can build like these ghost buildings to be like if you want to like try out like yeah can i fit these many and it can be like oh it doesn't fit like or so you get like a preview of what it would look like if you were to build in a certain composition without like spending the actual materials on it uh and then like build them directly by looking at them that's i don't think you can but this is a work in progress mod as well so it's also possible that this might come but that's that's uh i think that's the next thing yeah i think i think that's pretty important honestly yeah it's frustrating but it's really nice it doesn't yeah yeah but it's really nice like if you want to preview stuff um and there's one for every building there's not four conveyor belts i believe but it's a really neat neat mod
>
> [Music]
>
> yeah so
>
> [Music]
>
> um next up we have the refined power uh let's see yeah here we are so i place it over here so there's a mod for let's see it's here yeah for just a bunch of more uh power options i know people have been asking for like these things like windmills a lot right so that exists in that mod there are like these smaller ones which don't generate a lot of electricity um these are also like depending on where you place them you get more output i believe uh as far as i can tell because like some of these are more efficient than others like apple pi five and yeah this one's got like three uh and then they're sorted that out yeah i have no idea because i assume there's some like logic because i i think like if we want to do that we would have to like make some world logic you know yeah exactly like certain volume or whatever it's like on this it's really windy on this hill or something yeah um and i think that's one one reason why we just haven't committed too much but because like these are fairly much just like you get free power from them um essentially like you just place them and you get power whereas all everything else like you need to do some kind of setup in the game all right but these are really cool uh they said uh faker says the higher they are more power you get and they need 16 foundations between them so they don't reduce the power production ah okay yeah there's that and then also open the scanning tool for refined power open the scanning tool oh oh interesting
>
> [Music]
>
> you say wind turbine interesting i have wind wristing yeah yeah after talking about wind yeah winter thing but this is for water uh no it's so they have placed something in the world for like water turbines which is this thing which generates water like power from water or currents and then there's like this thing where like automated biomass so you can like um you can add a uh a conveyable to it what is that which is like a effective decision we've had to not have but there's a monitor is that going to uh the food court yes it is um so yeah there's just a bunch of cool alternative power sources i also have uh way up here i have solar panels to power some stuff yeah uh but on that note of of uh food let's showcase the farming mod farming yeah man so there are like different uh greenhouses you can build um these ones are like the manual ones so these you have to like you have to walk up to them and like put seeds in there uh these ones are making uh wheat so i can take the wheat and go to my like bakery here a cooker and place the wheat in here and it bakes bread and you can bake like a lot of stuff like you make muffins this is runescape man you gotta get your farming stat up man yeah i didn't make red berry pies give them the dwarves yeah um so yeah there are i think there are different types of seeds or maybe it's the same type seems like yeah it's the same type but it's like different amounts of seed for different types of things so you can grow so i'm growing wheat in these ones and here's like the mark ii version of it which is automated so like uh don't think burgers oh i mean it's a it's a crime against humanity if you can't but apparently i mean it's a work in progress maybe i don't know uh we need to add lizard burgers that's for farms sure dude it would be amazing if the mod was like yeah you put liz doggo in in the search container and then it just feeds it into the machine and it makes lizzie duggan burgers um i'll so yeah like there's also automated greenhouses which feeds lizard hot dog uh and here here i'm growing corn and here you can see how like i connected water as well so i have a water thing coming here and that makes it enriched so it's like a better uh thing and yeah it's automated and there's like the uber greenhouse which is like super automated it's like biggest biggest hell um i'm also growing wheat so it's really cool you imagine going to the supermarket and you're gonna be like you know those like for four dollars you can get a bunch of corn or you can get the rich corn for five dollars yeah dude the rich corn isn't that like ngo kind of yeah like kind of or like like or like uh eco-friendly or something yeah yeah yeah but it's really cool i i actually played a lot with this mod uh itself just because it was nice to like get a new chain of like stuff to build uh because like you make seeds out of um sandstone or rims called um so i built like this whole rack to make it automatically you make seeds of sandstone no it's called limestone sorry limestone you get this thing yeah let's take another little production and you put them you can put them in the constructor and like these and whatnot but also like there's a different you know chains of stuff like so when you bake stuff you can bake like pies and then you have different stuff that you need for instance this needs a yacht berry so you need to grow that as well so this is this is more to it i guess just like food i suppose you couldn't do yeah yeah and exactly and and uh like once it's done you can like i think i would have a bunch of corn maybe not let's throw this stupid nut away i got some corn here you're gonna be like yay i got corn and they have like different health stats as well i think the muffin is the best one of course it is but here i have bear like bread the models are pretty sweet too so yeah yeah that's right that's that's literally the bread that i buy when i go to the supermarket you gotta get that bread man it's a throttle out whatever yeah
>
> [Music]
>
> um next up we have like this thing the 3d texts uh this is a decorations mod as well it's like you just build letters uh let's see where it is with audio there we go decorations just there there have been a few uh pictures in our highlights that have showcased this like you can spell out stuff so like check out the dyson sphere it says chicken yeah i'm not gonna i didn't want to show off too much because i also want people to explore a bit with the mod itself but yeah there's there's some really cool um uh power sources that are available to you uh but yeah like the the 3d text is you can spell up things so here's like my secret secret box you'll never know what's inside that it's super secret very secret seriously yeah um so yeah um it's really simple to use as well there we go i lost i lost control and they've got like asterisks and in one of these and cyrillic and and whatnot so yeah really cool i i've it's really nice like markup and it's it's like for those people like in a distance be like what is that oh that's the that's the secret box right you can look at that but there's also a mod for signs which is a separate mod which you got here so you can place like little slides you're on vacation permanent vacation yeah uh i'm so scared jase uh so you can just place that whatever like this stream sucks and i know where you live i mean it's true oh yeah you press this button and it's got the same thing we do i think this is like the extension to our uh train stuff uh yeah the same bug uh but yeah it's really and this is great for like marking down containers and whatnot um hey snoot when are we getting signs that's a good question i don't know wouldn't you like to know uh so that the science mod is called utility signs um and and one thing if if y'all haven't noticed there's there's two cool things here on this platform but it's like first of all there's trees growing on my [ __ ] foundation these are the decorations mod this is also something that we've seen sometimes when we're uh seeing pictures where people have like placed like you can place like all the pretty much all the foliage that in the game like like a cactus here and uh decorate your base uh and i think you're like you can paint the foundation green so it looks like fake grass you know uh and here i've made like a shitty sand garden kind of it's very very thin yeah very zen um so that's the decorations mod um you need like the like the rock garden things with the swirls yeah i don't think we i don't maybe there are acids for it because i have there's a lot of [ __ ] foliage in the game right so there's a lot of stuff you can do maybe you can make it with clams right oh yes very nice yeah just make it with clams yeah what's the problem looks like a rock garden what do you guys think good chat rock guard i mean if you literally had a picture of a rock garden right now and this i i wouldn't know which one to shoot you know does anyone know if there's a mod to holster weapon or tool i think there is i'm not sure but i think we can check it out later um so so here's a really cool one um this is a teleporter mod where you can set up like teleporting points so i've set one up like over here stupid i want to say but i've set one up down there yep and you might be noticing so right there this is also [ __ ] like um so you just can figure like okay i call this my base this is the greenhouses and just like just teleport bam now i'm there so quick why isn't that in the basement like what are the devs doing yeah what the [ __ ] this guy this sound effect is amazing too let me show this off real quick because this is [ __ ] oh what is this this is from like mad max or something they had a [ __ ] volkswagen and mad max no not the volkswagen but it just looks like a like a like a death machine yeah i mean it kind of is it's got flaps like look at that [ __ ] whenever i slide it it pulls out the flaps oh really yeah shake it oh damn that's super cool yeah so i think this is a re-skin of uh the explorer it behaves like the explorer at least i don't know if they um perfect this yeah perfect this is exactly what i wanted this is how i explore the world all right fantastic uh let's just leave it there uh but yeah the teleporter mod is really nice it's really fast to set up mystery machine gun monster truck
>
> [Music]
>
> um and yeah there's like two modes to it you can also set it so that automatically like just standing on it it will move you somewhere but here i'm like like picking my my spot so that is the teleporter mod uh now we're gonna probably going through a few of the more complex ones i'd say um more mods there are more dude but wait there's more i haven't even [ __ ] started well i have started but you know what i mean so there's this mod called the micromanage mod which i think is really really neat um this is like for you know when you place something you can't really move it so with this mod you can so if you let me just uh refer to this let me place like a few foundations here right so i'm going to place like one whoops i [ __ ] that up oh it went through that maybe it didn't blow anything uh so yeah like here are a bunch of foundations and what if i'm like oh no i wanted to like move them up like i want to have them on like pillar support like that so you can like use this mod to do that so you like uh let's see if i do this correctly you click on them and you have control and then you can like wait which one is this
>
> [Music]
>
> yeah so you can like move them right you can rotate them as well you can yeah in all different angles you can also well whichever button is this isn't this one click like clashes a bit with the with the utility mod but because they're using the same keys but you can yeah you can like move them around in different constellations and you can also scale them up and down which explains like some of the the mods we've seen we're like what the [ __ ] is that no this is a scaled-down thingamajig tiny foundations yeah tiny foundations what is this a factory for ants yeah so uh so yeah now i can like place my support here whoops
>
> [Music]
>
> and if i'm like no it's still too too low because like now i'm gonna allow like maybe you like that or maybe you want to like move them down even more so you can like do do do do do i want to make it down even more yeah moving down anymore let's do it what if you do this yeah that's where i want it that's perfect all right um very nice i don't know if there's a way to like do uh similar to what a reaction mod does where like you can select an area but maybe that's something that's coming or maybe you can already do that and i just haven't figured it out yet um but so that's pretty much like that's the that's the gist of the micromanagement there are more stuff to it but let's not go too deep into it uh but there's also something called the era actions mod and this is probably like one of the oldest mods uh that's been around this this is a [ __ ] legend okay and i've actually built like most of this building with the air reactions mod because so this building is just like every floor is like two constructors with well getting there two constructors um and i built like a [ __ ] ton of floors right and this building this takes forever um so there is a little way to like cheat it a bit uh using the air actions mod so the air actions mod is essentially like you mark down areas that you want to copy um and you can copy like foundations and constructors and like yeah move them up and stuff so let's just make a quick demo here so like if i have a bunch of foundations here and i place like if i play like an old well maybe not a whole extractor but like yeah i don't no let's just put a construction keyboard all right so so say that like i want to have this but i want to have like 50 billion of them right um i don't want to [ __ ] like spend years building them right uh where are blueprints am i right um so with the air reactions mod you can let's see if i remember the commands you can click and look at the corners here and be like oops so now essentially like in 3d marked this whole thing and [ __ ] there we go and then you can like why can't i not see it copy paste yeah so there so here you can be like yeah i want to move it uh in the x-axis by 20 this is in-game i'm not quite sure what the the um the values are because i think it's our like internal one um because it's kind of easy to like have them line up they're saying to use fill fill oh yeah it's also pretty good uh the one i used is this one

> because this feel also i mean let me try it out a bit let me i'm gonna experiment a bit it's doing the y-axis so you can like using let me experiment so you're okay like yeah exactly so so here you go here you have like where you can quickly make like a bunch of them in one axis or if you have like a specific one you want to copy and paste and the thing here is like every axis was that yeah i make a bunch in every axis let's do it uh not that one
>

> okay and then you can be like let's play 10 and then 10. yes and preview that [ __ ] and the game crashed did it really yeah there we go it did it it did it yeah so yeah this just makes you know cool a little faster to build you know what i'm saying and the thing here as well is like i haven't placed these yet these are like previews so like if if it doesn't line up to what you think like i don't like like the clips here i don't like that you can be like all right then just uh close it oh wait yeah there you go so it doesn't happen so nothing happens so so let's say i just want to copy paste this and like move it 15. let's check it out sorry 16. can you like yeah it looks good and then you can be like okay boop and then i copied those five buildings and the cool thing is it also copies the recipe um i haven't set a recipe here but if i had i think it copied the recipe as well so this would have the same recipe but even then even if you didn't do that you can still go and see if i if i select all of these there's also a setting for like set recipe it can be like i want it to make iron rods pretty cool boop and you set all the set on rods for all of those so it just makes a building a little a lot more faster uh does this spend any materials asks cpu uh i think you can uh decide uh i don't quite remember okay um and then panna card is saying can you tell everyone you guys help us a lot by providing headers advice help etc uh for creating all these uh tools because we would like to let people know that you guys are awesome well but yes we did like uh yeah i think it was i think it was marcus for the most part i think uh who helped out uh a bunch with um it's actually allowing this yeah yeah there's a bunch of us that that helps out um because we we really love the mods and we want to help out as much as we can so whenever people like ask us about like how does this work like we have no secrets in terms of how we implement stuff like we just tell people how we do things yeah so yeah we we've helped out a lot um exactly i don't know more hogs i know just what to do copy paste oh i can't replace the hogs yeah does that work of course that wouldn't work there's no no no you can't cover facebook the hogs um you can choose if you uh if you take build costs yeah yeah so you can yeah yeah so so if you do this you can pick like use build cost and then you won't be able to build it unless you have the materials for it um and yeah there's a there's a there's a bunch more like this is just the tip of the iceberg i mean it is pretty much the thing but like that's what it's there for it's like make it easier for you to be able to build all bigger bases and whatnot um so yeah reaction yep area actions it's the [ __ ] love heart love heart i love heart uh cpu says changes everything into a good game i mean it kind of does honestly like it makes uh some of the the annoying builds does it doesn't skip a beat there no i mean i mean all these mods do like they're like even small mods do change like significantly especially one when you cheat where like you don't have to like pay anything uh yeah that's pretty good uh yeah exactly like that's that's you uh satisfactory isn't [ __ ] competitive or anything like that you know what i mean um and this this so this mod is really cool this was released like yesterday or like sun like very recently uh this is really cool so this is a satisfying like fix it networks is what it's called uh let me actually build a new one just demonstrate what it's like uh so this is a computer inside the game essentially oh yeah is this panna cotta's thing yeah exactly uh no let's build it upside down so this is a it's it's like here's a computer right and it's like it's just a frame for computers you need to put in like a cpu here's how i'm putting the cpu here uh it's a little bit finicky wait let me put this that's where i can actually see it there we go so you can like i'm going to place a cpu and you also need ram so you can put in a ram here apparently you can run out of ram so you need to put in more ram if you need it uh and you also need a like an actual chip which you make so i'm going to run over and do that if i have the materials for it otherwise i'm just going to buy it i get it what is it where is that or maybe it's not equipment maybe it's just maybe i just crafted actually yeah there we go so craft a a rom chip and you put that in the computer like so and now you have a computer and this is like it's got lua in it so you can like actually program stuff here so like prince hello hell hell [ __ ] hello hello world the classic oh yeah and you can pretty much like access almost anything uh so say that i place let's see here let me i have an example running but let me show this so like if i place a constructor here um you can and let me hook this up with a oh i have like what if what the [ __ ] have i done with my hotbar i messed up my harp are you guys oh boy so like in the regular base game you have like this power connector right but this mod also has like networking poles and whatever so you can hook up like like logic to everything now so now i hooked up the constructor right and then there's this item that you use here to like get like oh here's my constructor daddy um and it's got like an id right so you can like copy and paste that and you can access it let's see if i can remember that i don't have the documentation open right now so let's see if i can remember it so it's like uh constructor equals to component.proxy and then you get the id and then let's print the components yeah so here's like here's my constructor daddy reference in the computer and you can like print uh sorry so get all the uh

> instructor get members i think if i remember correctly remember yeah so that's like all the funky oh wow james calm down so print m so now it's gonna print like pretty much the interface to this building so here's like the api calls that i have to this constructor right so i can like i want to get yeah so it's it's pretty much like calling like the stuff that's in our code and getting access to it and you can use that in the lua setting right so here you can like you can change the recipe with the computer and you know get the stuff so i have an example running over here with a biomass generator um where i have like here's some fuel in it and i've set up a screen here that just displays like how much fuel is in the biomass generator so let me turn off the power thing so this should be maybe running or maybe i haven't hooked it up oh i don't think this is producing anything that i think that's the problem let me make some iron plates go make the iron plates no power what are you talking about i have power right here asperboy says oh i can work while i'm gaming as well yeah like pretty much like it's insane uh so yeah now we'll display for me on this display here like how much fuel is in the biofuel so you can imagine like this setups imagine i have like 20 biofuel generators in the beginning right and the tedious thing about this is kind of hard to know like what how much fuel is in the bio mass generators so imagine a setup here where i have like 20 of them and i can have like this like command screen showing like how much fuel is left in each uh in each one i think there's a little bug in my code here sometimes this needs to be updated there we go so now like if i remove this it will like update on the screen to show and you can like you can program so like it will give you a warning when like biofuel is running low and stuff like that so like say i could code like for instance that say this is less than 10 then it should like light up a light or something or give me a warning sound or something so i know that oh [ __ ] i need to run back and refuel my biomaster energy so like there's just so much you can do with this and this is like like on your like ui and stuff so that you doesn't matter where you are you'll know more yeah yeah and like you can put in you can make like uh speaker polls here to like in-game make a siren or something if you if you like
>

> and you can code you can make like uh you can program the splitters and stuff to be like for every five items should go left every five items to go left or right or something else like completely what you want uh so there's just so much like potential with this mod specifically uh given the fact that you can like actually program stuff right so this spot is insane and this is literally like just the tip of the iceberg here like what i'm showing here because you can add like buttons uh you can add like modules here you can access different modules here's kind of like a breadboard design and customize this however you want you can make so this is a small screen you can also make like the large ones um so get it get out of here mr construction um how does the ram limit you on the thing i don't know maybe pentacotta can answer that but i think it's like the amount of instruction it runs per tick or something so like if you want stuff to be able to run in peril you can add more cpus and program those i suppose so yeah this is this this mod is insane yeah it's really crazy i've uh i've dropped into some of the streams so just uh watch it it's quite nice but anyway it is streaming right or am i thinking of someone else yeah no it's pinacata it's my final code yeah uh his uh stream is called like code code everything oh [ __ ] cde yeah yeah but it's really dope i i can't wait to see what people do with this um after every lunatic i simply check how much memory the lower garbage collector manages right now oh okay yeah it's really neat and uh yeah panicotta is also the one who made the light it up mod which hopefully kind i kind of timed this right because it the sun is setting a bit but there's a there's also mod for lights which is something that people have been asking for a lot um and right now i set these there are a bunch of different lights uh i also have these ones these are pretty cool portable lights where you can place down and turn on these need fuel i don't quite know like what fuel they're running on i think it's just get the [ __ ] out of me dude i was like typing yeah that's pretty cool wait so what is that thing so this is like a portable light that you can place um right but this is lighted up mod and we should get be getting some nighttime soon-ish i can show this part of the part of the moor factory is also like um oh right the curved like windows here pretty neat so i made like a little watch tower here now you can stand there like president shinra from fun faces exactly exactly dude that's kind of what i was thinking when i made this um so now we see they can see it down here the lights light up so i've set them up so they light up automatically when it's nighttime but you can also have them like turn on whenever you want um so now it's it's a bit lighter and uh and a bit more frame rate it's really cool
>
> [Music]

> um yeah so those are the mods that i wanted to showcase specifically um if there's any more mods that you guys feel like you have to show this mod um please let me know in chat and we can you can literally download it and try it out because there are a few mods that i haven't tried out myself um so the the way it works when you're like oh wait look getting the capture [ __ ] off no i want i want i want this um so the way it works when you download mods is you you have the mod manager right and then you like select the mod like passive mode i want that click on the little thumbnail it downloads the mod in the background and installs it and now it's done that's literally it so now the mod is is in the game so when i boot it up again it's just gonna be in there you die chase uh what i'm not doing another thing now you were too quiet for a long time no no no i'm just throwing my friend on facebook yeah yeah yeah daisy chainman let me check that out really wasn't
>
> [Music]
>
> making notes you know making it for the future uh yeah there's there's just a ton of really cool mods uh there are like some are quality life some are like straight up um like items in the game um uh yeah check out the [ __ ] mods they're so cool jetpack mark ii just tweaks jetpack there like some mods are tweaks to the the are there's like mods to like slow down the whole game all as well like if you feel like the game is running too fast or like if if if uh if you think production like even at 100 efficiency you feel like it's still going like i'm progressing too fast there's like a mod for that as well i believe yeah there's a mod for like so it's always day what is your favorite mod well mine now is the the uh what's it called the the programming one the networking one yeah i think uh hmm it's that or the farming one but yeah they're both really cool as well yeah but the the fixate network one is really cool i haven't like tried since it came out like yesterday or something like that i haven't really tried it out much uh because i'm still like wrapping my head around the the api and whatnot but there are some things that are like this would be cool if we could do in the game and now those things are possible because i i would like to make like a big command console with like stats for everything that's going on in my factory so like i want to see like oh how much how many things are producing in this corner of the factory like what's going on in this corner and like standing in the hub area you can just like get a glance at what's going on but you can also like get access like if you want to like switch off parts of your factory that would also be really cool so the calculator is is an external tool that you can use to like um both look at your save files and see like what what's going on it's both like production planning so you can like check out like if i want to build comp super computers and i want them to be 100 efficient how like how do i need to configure everything for it to be like for me to be able to do that right so like if i add uh where is the computer the super computer is one like the most is the super computer you can like search for it i think as well but uh super computer so say i want to produce one super computer per minute these are the setups i need to do and these are like the like the percentages of efficiency i need to set my factories to and these are the ores i need and whatnot so it's got that it's also got this interactive map which showcases like where everything is on the map but also you can load in your save file here so it will showcase like how you build stuff and uh you can also edit the save files so so like if if for instance your vehicle glitched out and it flew out like from the world then you can like get the stuff from it and move it i believe in this editor it's really dope i've used this a lot at work uh for general like whenever people send me save files and i want to check them out and see like if there's something weird because sometimes you can tell from that but also a really good way to like just know without booting up the game like what is this save file again um so this this is this is really good [ __ ] and uh demarcio it doesn't show mod buildings only a few are supported so just uh yeah heads up there this is kind of also why i didn't boot up my safe phone right here so let's check out the uh just one last thing i want to check out uh one i think we're on the screen again we are i don't know if it's yeah i'm going to put my moves in a second uh so let's see where is that everyone wants to know what's in the box you have to click like and subscribe if we get 30 000 likes we'll show you what's in the box what's in the box you mean the secret box it's not free this isn't a charity yeah 30 000 likes yes there's there's something in here but uh you'll never know what it is yeah let me just try that little mod that we just downloaded also like when you download the mod still some mods will like be unlocked immediately some mods will be in the like in the tier section here so you have to unlock some of these update fours in the box
>
> [Laughter]
>
> where do we find the dispenser is that organization maybe dispenser so we'll hook this up with something we're gonna place something in here right here yeah so apparently it like this is for if you want to pick up like big stacks you can like run up to this and like pick it up how do you pick it up take off no wait this was not how people described it to me in chat you it contains the internet push the button push the button like where's the button one of the the other button like there we go okay there we go i found it i found it it's this button yeah so it's like a quick quick pick up thing so like look at this rocket rocket pick it up whoa i got 391 rockets two clicks all right this is pretty neat it's pretty neat that's pretty nice yeah i stand i stand i stay i stand i all righty then uh that's that's mods in a nutshell i guess um check check them out i i highly encourage you all to check them out there are a lot of real cool mods so if you feel like you're getting burned out by the game and you're like ah or or like you just booted up a meeting you're like [ __ ] this game does not it's not fun just try some mods so if you wanted mods and also there is a modding discord uh so if you go to uh fixit.app that website that we showed before where you can get the mod manager and all that there should also be a link to the discord there as well there's also instructions like if you want to make your own mod there are instruction how to do that as well uh and joining the discord they're super helpful like it's it's a bunch of really creative people and they're super helpful
