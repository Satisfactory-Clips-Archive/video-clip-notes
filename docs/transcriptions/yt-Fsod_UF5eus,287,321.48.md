> would pipe oh yeah he's a smoke that's how you smoke with a pipe alright hi everyone my name is Jason the community manager coffee stain studios today I'm just gonna be doing a and update some update information about update number three but before we do that I just want to say we released a developer highlight recently it's Hannah I can't say her last name not very fair Hannah's develop a highlight video on level design has just been released last week so I put a lot of time in that I'm really proud of it so please check it out if you want to do that so let's just go for the update information now let's get the bad news out of the way the update number three was scheduled for December but it is being pushed back I know that sucks it sucks for everyone here as well we want to get it out as soon as possible but at this stage like we could get it out but it's just not gonna be good enough quality for us so we're gonna push it back we'll always put the game first so we just have to wait a little longer unfortunately we think it's gonna be maybe late January or February but we think that in the same way that we thought it was gonna be out in December so like just we have no idea what anything's happening there is some good news and that is update number three will contain some really big changes to the game there will be some huge changes to contents and new content features as well as rebalancing and it's important to note that with rebalancing comes the potential of broken saves and we think that that is gonna happen from what I understand you should be able to still load your saves but it may be that your factory doesn't function as it used to so essentially you're probably going to be losing a lot of your work so the things you can do there are you can go through and fix the factory just just fix everything up which may take a lot of time for some of you or start a new and starting a new may sound kind of crappy but it also makes a little bit of sense with all the new content coming you may just want to start a new honestly so just keep in mind that you may lose progress on your save however we do have another solution which may help to and I'll talk about that just in a second so before I get onto that just want to also say that the update will also have a lot of smaller things like quality of life fixes bug fixes optimization new features big and small so you're gonna get a bunch of content with this not just big stuff and one thing that some people have asked is is update number three the last update absolutely not we're working on this game for a while we have no idea how many updates are coming off to update number three that's gonna be for probably five six so I don't know how many there's gonna be but fear not the game is not nearly done there's a lot more stuff to come so I mentioned before another like workaround or a solution to the broken save games thing and again this isn't completely ideal but it is something the thing is satisfactory is supposed to be DRM free it's not exactly but it kind of is and so what you can do is you can create a copy of the current version of the game or whatever version of the game and play that offline separate to the current version so you can potentially create a copy of the version before update number three and then that will continue to work with your old saves if you make sure you backup all saves so that is something and in order to do that I'm going to explain that to you now so take it away me okay the first thing you need to do is go to your install directory alright and then you're gonna call wait you're gonna make a copy of the game to some folder that you want I'm just gonna make a folder on the desktop and just call that backup alright so then now I'm just gonna grab the the whole all the files and move the backup folder just a little bit and then I'm gonna copy and I'm gonna paste it in there so we're gonna let this run

> okay so now we just need to create a shortcut so just right-click go create shortcut of the exe file the factory game one so then right click be shortcut and go down to properties you'll see that there's a target field right here at the end just put - epic portal in there and then click apply or okay whatever and then you can just launch the game from there thanks me now that's not that great of a solution again it's really convoluted but it is something we are looking into a potential solution which could be that we add the like pre update 3 version of the game to the epic launcher as well so you'll have another satisfactory version in your library but maybe that's not good either because then it's gonna get all like messy because you're getting all these versions of satisfactory in there but it's gonna be simpler than making copies of your versions and things like that so I don't know what do you guys want we don't really know what we should do there so I would love your opinions if you could leave that down in the comments and it'll help us make a decision so a lot of folks have been asking questions about tier 8 like is it gonna be included in update number 3 and the answer is no tier 8 is not and one of the reasons for that is essentially if we add tier 8 now than the things that we would want to add in the future would likely break or conflict with tier 8 and then we'd have to go fix it and then that's gonna break a bunch of saves etc so we want to the best of our ability to create a good foundation so tier 7 for example the things we are adding now would break a tier 8 if we had it so we want to do that stuff so we don't break things later and then have to rework on tier 8 it should be better for us and you're still gonna get a lot of content anyway so some people have also been asking about will there be some updates before the big update number 3 so will there be some smaller updates and the thing is there might be we don't really know at the moment there's one thing that I really want to fix and a lot of the non-english speakers out there I are having some issues with language and so I'm trying to fix the localization as well so if we can put an update out I'm hoping that that would be part of it another thing that we would possibly put out as an update is an engine so a Yui 4 engine upgrade and also parallelization so and what that just means is running more course of your CPU so that the game would just run much much better that is currently in testing right now that's not something we would hold out for update three once it's done it's done and we're putting it out because you'll all benefit from it straight away and lastly people have been asking a bunch about dedicated server support and of course it's super cool thing so people who are still asking about that and the status there is that it is being developed I'm not sure how far it is we can just go and ask the guy one sec how's the dedicated service going yeah and dedicated service is not something again that we will be keeping until update number three once it is done we want it out there as soon as possible it likely won't be perfect when it does come out so we want you to test it so we can make it better so as soon as it's done we're gonna put it out there no waiting no messing around with that okay all right and so that's all the information that I'm putting out today there's a lot of information there I'm sure you had a lot of other questions that you wanted answers to I know you want concrete information about features that's gonna be an update number three I don't think that's gonna happen until update number three maybe we can leak some stuff beforehand but until then we just we're focusing on what we're doing and we want it to be a big bang when we announce the stuff right so thank you all very much for watching if you enjoyed the video subscribe to my own mix there okay bye
