### Transcript

> asking questions about tier 8 like is it
> gonna be included in update number 3 and
> the answer is no tier 8 is not and one
> of the reasons for that is essentially
> if we add tier 8 now than the things
> that we would want to add in the future
> would likely break or conflict with tier
> 8 and then we'd have to go fix it and
> then that's gonna break a bunch of saves
> etc so we want to the best of our
> ability to create a good foundation so
> tier 7 for example the things we are
> adding now would break a tier 8 if we
> had it so we want to do that stuff so we
> don't break things later and then have
> to rework on tier 8 it should be better
