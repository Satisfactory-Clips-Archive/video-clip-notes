> okay all right anyway, how many hours should satisfactory take usually new player one ghost 1.0, I we have a it's it's a lot like I'm not gonna lie I mean I think it's a lot, there's a bunch of hours I don't like the way how do you make the case the things the smart plating you can't do that you can't craft that you have to automate it oh yeah- I okay but how like where what building like in a, manufacturer or is it it's not the constructor it's the the next one the one with the two inputs is it assembler or manufacturer I can never remember the assembler that's the one, yeah we have, so so for how many hours for the game we have a number in mind, I don't personally know that number, but there is a make it in the ass but there's a number we we do like if you've ever noticed in the beginning of the game we say that we do collect like gameplay we collect like anonymous gameplay information and one of those like things that we're collecting is like how long it takes for people to progress in the game so we're keeping track of like how long it takes for people to get to certain tiers, and we're balancing the game in like in in the average of that so to speak so like if if for 90 of the players it takes like x amount of hours and we think that's too long or too short then we'll balance the game for that, and we have that number in mind for 1.0, we just I don't know the exact number so yeah
