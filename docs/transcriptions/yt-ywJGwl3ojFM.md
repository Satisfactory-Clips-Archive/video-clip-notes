> how many people would be playing it, i need to i'll go check the list in a second but i think we've got like eight or nine people there's like one thing that we got to keep in mind is like everyone's busy doing their own stuff you know so it's like only the people who are interested in joining and are you know willing to to spend time when it can and that's you know not everybody but it seems like, quite a few people were interested in this trying to find that 10 people 10 people interested that i think that includes that might include smith though it does oh bummer but i mean you're not you're not one of the people that are getting well i mean you played now of course yeah but, no but i i i feel like we should have a round to why not like not now to like yeah build upon what was made one thing that yeah i mean maybe we'll see what happens but you know so there's also the possibility that if this was a good thing and if people enjoyed doing it and if you guys if the video ends up being really fun and you guys like it then it's possible we can build up keep keep doing this like potato thing and keep building upon the world that we have and that would be interesting
