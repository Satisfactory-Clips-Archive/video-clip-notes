> smaller ceiling lights, next question I don't know if that will be a thing or not signs are small lights right so so here's why I don't personally think that's going to be a thing because lights are still somewhat like lights is probably the most heavy the expensive render wise to to add like the more lights you have your performance is going to attack significantly if we add smaller lights, then they won't fill up the same like space as a regular light I think that's sort of what we're trying to do with the lights at the moment is just trying to fill as much light space as possible because if you want to light up the same amount of space with a small light as a big one you need a lot more of them that's going to cause more of a performance like bottleneck and let's face it you guys are going to do that you are going to fill the same space with small license plate lights so if you want a small use small lights use science I guess because signs aren't but they're not lights though they're emissive so they don't quite work the same way
