> um does soft clearance apply to hyper tubes that's a good question i actually don't know i think they are actually i don't know i think they're not soft clearance um just because of collision issues because you're still colliding with the environment when you're in a hypertube so i'm pretty sure but wait if you have soft clearance on conveyor belts and you build one through a hypertube doesn't that also mess with collision oh did we actually think about this wait or maybe wait what is it what does it matter though because uh there used to be an issue where if you have a hyper tube and you drag it through something that has collision you will get like bumped out of the hyper tube maybe don't do it then yeah i guess yeah maybe that's not a bug don't do it because you don't want it don't do it five delayed

> this communication amongst the team as well oh no company's falling no but that must make sense because like if you do that you're going to get bumped out of the hypertube and that's like on you right so like then you won't build it that way i guess not our problem your fault not our problem yeah you deal with that chat um you snoot you shouldn't send that to the keyway side that's a good point i should but that's a really good question now i want to try that not really oh curious be like whoa update 5 is so good right now you know what maybe i will boot up update 5 in the background here here we go whoa update 5 is turrets ah [ __ ] it crashed uh uh worked progress all right anyway um doing it live
