> yeah keep going keep going okay why not a content creator competition for the funniest clip and the reason is because we don't want to just not everyone like the the allure or the attraction to certain content creators isn't always because they're funny right it's not like your favorite content creator has to be funny in order to have value right so if we were to say send us the funniest clip well then we're only going to get funny people, and that's fine there's nothing nothing wrong with with funny people, now I'm doing this new thing I swear there's nothing wrong, but but then we would be we would be sort of skewing who we're showing we're not giving everyone a fair chance when there's a lot of other good quality content out there it's just not like hilarious content, because that's the thing we we kind of faced today where this is like we can do this but then this clip doesn't really represent it's a funny clip but it doesn't does it actually represent the streamer or youtuber it's not like a a great moment of theirs and we know that we could present represent them better later yeah probably somebody asked if we've highlighted runestone and yes we have we we also try to like not highlight the same people over and over again so we try to do, what's it called like turntable of highlights or something I don't know yeah yeah whatever yeah like, sometimes- I think you know we've highlighted some people like two times or something like that not highlighted I don't think we may be yeah we maybe like rated someone twice rated yeah yeah where it's kind of the same situation there like when we rate people we also want to kind of rate people that you know maybe are great streamers but just haven't got that like push that they need to be able to become part like on the path of partner or something like that and we really enjoy helping like content creators out in those cases, because there are so many good content writers out there and we just want to put ice on them, not just us you guys eyes all right so I thought you said ice yeah gonna cool them down they're a little too hot yeah that's that's the the the yeah I guess that's the nice way to say it spicy content yeah need some ice cool them down, cool we're ready to move on or do you feel like there's anything else we want to add to this, I don't know I think it's fine I think it's fine yeah we'll we'll work on this and try to come up with a better solution so that we can
