> so hey everybody welcome welcome hope you're all good yes yes, last week update six came out on Early Access and, a lot of people played it very a lot of fun yeah I think a lot of people played it on Saturday wasn't it I think it was Saturday yeah during the weekend we almost broke our concurrent player number record on Steam we our record is like 34 000 players at the same time and we got up to like 31. oh well yeah which is weird because update 6 is supposed to be a smaller update and we didn't do a big reveal and we didn't do any marketing or PR or anything like that so cool our jobs are, redundant I guess so yeah this is the last stream free this time bye everyone just, just put that out there and then people will play it I guess so that was really cool I don't think we can anticipated that I think, we expected a much smaller number but, you guys keep, breaking around keep surprising us yeah thanks so super cool
