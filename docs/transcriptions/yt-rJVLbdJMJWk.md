> will update 4b like update 3 will break saves, i don't think so we update 3 broke saves because planning wise it broke like adding pipes broke so much like the aspect of adding a feature will always have to kind of overweigh you know that aspect of like it will break people's save files or, if will impact you know something that makes the game you know a lesser experience so we try to avoid as much as possible, you know adding stuff that do break people's save files pipes was such a huge feature and such a good feature that we felt like okay we feel confident enough to like be able to like implement that and have you know the issue of people safe i was breaking, because it did really change the balancing of the game quite significantly, but we think it was worth it we we we hope you guys agree with that, pipes is dope to have in the game, and and not to mention the meme itself was so like it was so satisfying to unveil that, so so we try not to break save files, we also like even for pipes we discussed like ways maybe we could mitigate or fix that because we've had, some updates to the game where we change how the save structure works and stuff like that and, from those type of updates you don't really get anything new it just breaks your save file and it helps us so to speak when we keep developing the game and we have one of those things coming but we're not gonna like break your saves we're actually gonna we're making a system so that it migrates your save files to the new save system so to speak so trademark hopefully nothing should happen, and this is part of the the sub-level saving system that i mentioned previously so it's not really a leak so always back up your saves, that is who boy cannot stress how important that is because i honestly okay this is quite important i think everybody watching right now this is this is really important back up your saves all right because, i get a lot of dms from people where their saves like get corrupted because of the steam cloud saving it gets corrupted because of epic's cloud saving sometimes people's hard drives fail

> we've had one issue where the game like we have a lot of systems that make sure that when we're saving we're not corrupting anything but we've had one location or at least that's been reported so far where like the the safe hall just corrupted, and it should crash but it didn't, so i reckon really recommend backing up your safety it doesn't have to be like you know something super advanced like i see a lot of people saying like one driver google drive or something just make a copy of your save file from time to time or something like that, or if you know that like if you played like especially for those people that played for like 600 hours like come on don't let that work out a waste because we're incompetent or or steam or epic or incompetent or whatever like can happen okay, so yeah so yeah make sure to back up your your say file from time to time, 950 hours yeah i've i'd i'd back up that save, because they're not store like well they are saved on steams and epics like cloud syncing service whatever, do you trust them i don't know, so yeah
