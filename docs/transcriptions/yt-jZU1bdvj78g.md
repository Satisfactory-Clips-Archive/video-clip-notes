### Transcript

> I have a question for, miners mk3 miner can output 1200 or 1220 per minute but mk5 belts can only transport 780 I know that faster belt is impossible but, basically why can't you attach a splitter to the directly to the miner because then you could you know split 600 either way or something like that, questions on satisfactory m.com leave your recommendation or your suggestion there other people can upvote it and that will get the like director and other members of the team see those messages and they can take that into consideration that's basically a feature request so I'm answering this question because you said that you've asked for the past four streams but when I check your messages you've only you've only talked about something else you've only talked in one other stream jace are you using mod powers what the hell I'm using mod power because I was like oh I keep missing this question but I don't remember seeing it yeah but, but other people have asked that question as well and I mean the best thing to do is honestly just put it on the qa side so that the team can see that people want it right and then they can consider it we haven't fully decided like what they yeah cause like we can maybe have faster tracks in the future but we don't know exactly what approach we're gonna do so give us your feedback on what you think is best
