> uh do you plan to add more tears this is a question that we get very often uh or or rather people are like when's the what's the next tier like what's here tier nine or tier eight or whatever is the last year in the game i don't know uh people always ask like when you add more tears the thing is like adding more tears isn't something that will necessarily add more content to the game so like you know if we keyed up in the game that doesn't mean that we're going to have like a bajillion tiers like at some point there's probably gonna make sense to stop um so we're gonna if we add more content to the game we're probably gonna add it in the existing tiers and balance that out and make that make sense um so i can't really say how many tiers that's gonna be in the game at this point um yeah it's like whether whether or not the new content comes in a tier or not like i can see why people would be like new tier means new content yeah but also new content can go in existing tiers as well so
