### Transcript

> are you ends probably you're in procedural map we've already, debunked the procedural map we're not gonna do procedural stuff, or sorry let me let me rephrase this we're not gonna do procedural generation in terms of like terraforming and stuff like that we've we've already went down that route and we didn't like it we we prefer doing it this way we're doing right now we also can't like really back down now because you can you have to kind of commit to either or, we felt like handcrafting is it gives you a much more detailed experience terror forming, and we actually tried a little bit of like procedural like generation of the environment and we just didn't like it that much it's also really difficult to make it good you know and not like it it gets very repetitive after a while so we'd rather make like one very detailed map
