> will light be added to the game ooh this is something we talk about almost every stream, it's not impossible that we add lights to the game, that's the thing it's not impossible it's it's like it's a thing we can't add but we need to solve the the limitations of that, and it's like it's really not performance is the biggest gripe with light it's really complex making it performant, that's that's really the main reason why, there's a there's a light mod for it and people every time people bring it up they're always like yeah but it completely caps the the fps of the game, it has a huge performance impact, so like it's not impossible it's it's totally like- I can I can like let me legit say that it's definitely on our thoughts like it's not ruled out at all

> even though it's a huge or like undertaking but it's not ruled out whatsoever, let me assure you of that, but I don't I just don't know if it will happen or when it will happen, so yeah I guess that's the state of that's the state of things in terms of lighting, like even like if we do add it like it will probably come with some type of limitation I don't know what that will be it's just like something we need to like just throw a bunch of time on and see we can do with it or not at some point and I think like there's always stuff that we want to do so we never really get a chance to do that so yeah that's that's the state on lights
