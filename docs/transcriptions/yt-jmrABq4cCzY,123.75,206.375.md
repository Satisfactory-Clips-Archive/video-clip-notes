> so let me first kind of address one of the things with plutonium fuel rods, when we released the game a lot of people thought that it was a bug that you could sink the plutonium fuel rods including this guy, but that is actually intentional apparently so up until update four you weren't able to sink your nuclear waste and you still can't but there's a way to like get around that kind of where if you take your nuclear waste and use it in the new nuclear refinement process and create plutonium fuel rods those are then possible to sink in the in the awesome sink if you didn't know and that is intentional, because we want to kind of create a trade-off between whether or not it's worth using the new fuel rods in your in your nuclear power plants or if you think that waste is such a cumbersome thing that you'd rather get the waste out of your way and refine all that, and that's kind of the trade-off that we want to go with if it's worth or not you know getting the new power versus sinking it i don't know if we're gonna like enough enough i don't know if we're gonna nerf or buff the, like the regular fuel rods or the plutonium fuel rods or how they're gonna burn or whatever one of the options we're looking at currently is making maybe uranium a bit maybe potentially a bit weaker and then make plutonium a bit stronger to kind of balance that out a little bit we'll see another thing that we're looking into is to
