> um will there be a halloween event most likely not since uh you know like halloween is like next month and update five you know the expectation is sometime in fall so maybe within the next month or two uh it's probably not a good time for us to be adding like fun like yeah fun extra stuff to the game when we sort of need to make sure that the things that we're putting in like like uh seasonal stuff i mean everything that we add is hopefully fun but um yeah it's not a really good time for us to be adding that stuff in because we want to make sure that the stuff that we want in for update five is in and working well so uh probably not gonna be any halloween stuff hopefully we can do some christmas stuff though
