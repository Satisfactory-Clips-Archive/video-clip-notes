because this is such a weird intro to our to our little regular weekly based show that we usually do here on this side of twitch, where we hang out with our lovely community who play satisfactory or maybe you don't play satisfactory I don't know maybe maybe you've got better things to do with your life but welcome we're, we usually, what's up jace you look yeah perturbed what's wrong yeah that's easy to stop using that [ __ ] sunscreen you need to check you need to check the use by date dude this is what I actually look like I usually have color grading on so I look normal when whenever we film anything if you can help make up when we meet in person yeah yeah for sure for sure, yeah so, yeah this this is the weekly dev stream this is probably the the best intro we've had to the stream so far didn't even start on time this is your smurf account or something actual smurf account yeah snurf account nerf account that's so good, what's that talking about yeah this is the intro anyways, welcome everybody welcome so, a couple a couple of a couple of not a couple actually just one thing we quickly just want to announce, real quick well well I have jace here with me because jason's gonna is usually here now for the community highlights part, and then just bolts out of here so get out of here yeah exactly so next week is twitchcon and me and jace will be attending whoa so if you're in amsterdam going for twitchcon then, come say hello yes yes yes we'll be there on the friday saturday sunday leave it on monday good times will be had by all, yeah so if anyone's gonna be there or even in the area like you know we'd be good to meet people at the con but like maybe we've been considering maybe doing like a meet-up or something in the area as well so even if you're not going the actual conference like maybe there's still a chance for you to come and meet us if you're you're you know near there unfortunately yeah well we'll probably like, we'll announce more on like twitter and stuff like that when when we have more information and stuff like that so it'd be on the lookout, make sure to follow us on twitter yeah it's gonna hit that follow button here's the twitter command that yes we do have a command version yeah yeah we do nice we're so professional making it for once a year the snoot sheds its skin can't wait to get sunburned again during which we probably won't be oh yeah someone posted a weather thing right it's going to be like 27 degrees it's gonna be steamy in the con yeah that's, can't wait for people to not shower you know I'll ha I'm gonna have to have two showers a day because if it's gonna be that warm and we're gonna be around that many people and we're gonna be out walking around all day oh I'm gonna have to like at 6 pm go back and grab a shower again and change clothes yeah I'm gonna have to bring like like eight days worth of clothes for for three or four days yeah yeah for sure cons are are it's it's better during like the winter than their cons because more more, I don't know ventilate or something so yeah it's gonna be it's gonna but it's gonna be fun we're we're going to amsterdam again I haven't been in amsterdam in a long time I haven't been traveling at all since I mean which makes sense, so good to see you you haven't been at a con like with like coffee scene or status for satisfactory anything before right because like I have a two you have yeah yeah we went to, the one in in czech republic last time oh true yeah no yeah I wasn't at that one so yes that's why I didn't think of it yeah okay that's true that's true and we did go to twitchcon in 2020 jace don't you remember oh we sure did buy tickets for it yeah I still have the, the I still rock the the twitch icon thingy that you get oh I think I enjoyed that yeah yeah yeah yeah I still rocked that one because it is it is proudest achievement attending twitchcon 2020 in amsterdam totally happy that's it's the thought that counts yeah for sure do you expect poor ac or something at the con you know it's not necessarily poor ac but like I think even if the ac is good that many people inside on a reasonably warm day and you're walking around for like six plus hours, yeah I think I think you're just gonna I'm gonna feel pretty gross by the end of that and then if there's like dinner plans or anything like that I'm gonna want to shower before I should just bring like a shower portable shower with us yeah and just like just hangs over your head yeah but then it's also a gamer convention and I don't know if it's necessarily gamers are more in sweat inducing or something but they are also like a little bit more infamous I guess but I don't know if twitchcon applies to those I don't know we'll see we'll find out we'll we'll give you a report, yes what like a smell report I don't know yeah exactly yeah we'll find out, so yeah good times good times will be had to see you next week
