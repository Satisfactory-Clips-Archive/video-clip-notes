> so, what about, what about the the content creator highlights no who are we who are we highlighting I bet you were really looking forward to that this week I can't wait, you take it away jay tell me who it is oh [ __ ] well played, no community, content creator highlight this week we couldn't really find anyone we it's actually kind of hard to find a content creator highlight and I think one of the reasons is because, the nature of our game and what a lot of people like about the game is it's a game you play for a long time and so like say streamers or even people who are playing, posting let's plays they can be really long-form content 30 minutes one hour two hours long streams can go you know four five six hours long right and the value of people's streams can't really be summed up in a 30 second to one minute clip you know not always and so sometimes what we need to do in order to showcase people is we try to find an like a cool little clip that we can show to all you guys and you're gonna be like hey that was pretty cool I'll check them out when you know 90 of people's content is really relaxing stuff and like updates on what's going on so, yeah we we want to find, we're going to keep trying to look for people to highlight every week but we may also try find we're thinking of some other ways that we can do things so that, it will make it easy for us to find, people and bits of their content that, sums them up well and sells them well yeah so that we can show it off to you guys, and it sounds like so and it's not like there aren't other like it's not like we and reached the end of the rope of like content careers to highlight here in the stream it's like jason's saying like we really wanna when we highlight content creators we really want to sell them and like showcase them to the best of our ability so it's not it's not just like you know a clip that doesn't really represent them and sometimes when we find content creators we're like struggling to just you know being able to like showcase them in their their best behavior or whatever, so we don't want to like I mean we could we could just do like a slide on the on the show and just be like here's the concentrator go look them up or something but we feel like we don't do them just as if we do that, so and the you know maybe part of the solution is that we have to

> just literally sit down and watch like actually just sit down and watch hours and hours and hours of footage to try and find a good one a good content creator and then two find a good like 30 second segment you know that we can highlight so yeah it's kind of weird like we have to find a solution so someone's saying have they've done direwolf I've seen direwolf on youtube but again I would need to watch more of the content get a better feel for them and try and find something that we can highlight to you yeah, yeah so we're gonna we're gonna look into our internal process here and how we wanna do this in the future and like if there are good ways to we can improve this, so we can keep doing highlights because we really want to yeah and we really want to showcase yeah new people and even like smaller people you know as well so we don't really want to just always go for the big folks exactly, but we also don't have the time to watch it literally every creator, especially when a lot of the content of satisfactory is let's plays, and let's plays can go for hours and hours on end so and you know maybe that's clips yeah but clips yeah yeah exactly, so I mean that that's sort of what I'm we're thinking limbo but like how do they submit clips right like if someone creates let's play content they don't create clips right so how would they do it and so we have some ideas of how to do that and we're going to figure it out and then we will get back to you guys about it yeah, but but as for right now we're not gonna we're not gonna say much more
