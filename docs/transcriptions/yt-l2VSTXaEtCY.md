> there it is I was like I didn't get a single question about turbo fuel for jet packs to stream it has it really been a stream if there's no question about turbo field for jet packs, the answer to that question is maybe in the future because the issue isn't necessarily that okay I'm gonna give the full answer like because I don't want to just dismiss someone for asking that question but because it is it is a valid question and I actually don't care if people ask the same question every time because how are you supposed to know that it's your first time asking the question unless you know naughty naughty but, we would like to have it so you can have, plutonium fuel rats we would like to have it so you can have turbo fuel engine in your jet pack one idea that we had, that we've been throwing around a little bit and maybe we'll do it maybe we won't I'm not saying that this is what we're gonna do but there's definitely like there's definitely room to have the possibility to have turbo fuel for jet packs and one idea we had was that, maybe we could make it so that you can unlock the jet pack a little bit earlier than it you can right now but it's like a significantly worse jet pack than it is right now and you use the packaged fuel for the worst version of the of the jet pack and when you make turbo fuel you can use that and it will work the way that jetpack works today in the current iteration of the of the of the game, that's one idea we don't know if that's actually going to work or not because there might be some balancing issue, but that's that's that's one thing we were thinking about, so yeah it's already terrible well get ready to go it's gonna get a lot worse if we do that so yes
