### Transcript

> you have to do how did we arrive at 4x4 we did a bunch of tests with like early game setups so the main thing that we kind of wanted out of it at least, from our earlier talks was that we want these kind of arrangements to be fitting in it of course so like logistic Solutions and stuff like that but also like early game setups like smaller setups and we just did a bunch of test cases with like, reinforced iron plates but also just cable and tried some aluminum setups and we kind of just landed on this one being the nicest one that still had a good restriction space like three by three is just too small because also if we wanted to be a box which is kind of what we want to do with it, when we started looking at this, then if you do free by free it's just too short but, it also causes a lot of issues very quickly for Constructors already for example yeah but four by four felt like a good size but you can actually still put a lot of stuff in it but you kind of have to start splitting up things once your production line is getting bigger, and this is actually the thing that we like about it where we do want people to segment this and find the solutions that work for these different kind of setups but of course we're still testing this I mean we're kind of set on this size for now but if there's a lot of people that are having issues with it or want different kinds of sizes they should just let us know yeah we will look into it but most importantly what we want to know is just how how they play yeah and see how it affects because this is like it actually is gonna be a game changer in some ways where the way I mean it's not maybe not well kind of like pipes with like it kind of changes how the game plays out sort of the same way here I think because, I think because I'm really curious how like creative builds are gonna look in the coming weeks like if we're going to see a lot of like similar builds or if things are going to be more boxy in the future, I'm really curious about that stuff too, but I think that a lot of people that don't like that don't want that look or that QB look like they're still going to be building the same way they have before, it just adds like a layer on top of that sort of so it'll be interesting to see
