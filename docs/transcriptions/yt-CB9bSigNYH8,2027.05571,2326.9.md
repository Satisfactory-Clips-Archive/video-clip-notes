> this looks with late it's a little dark
> so let's add it's not too dark but when
> the night falls
> [Music]
> and it gets pretty dark so let's add
> some lights
> am I in the right title hold on I will
> have to check and I can check by
> clicking this I'm x1 y3 so let's see
> that's not the one I have selected sift
> it click there it's selected and
> everything I place into it will be in
> that Thailand will be loaded with that
> tile foliage automatically does this
> because it's painted on the tile itself
> so that's very handy
> let's see details the situation can go a
> little wider and if we make it darker
> let's make it a little bluish to make
> them a bit more cave like I suppose and
> then make it more intense
> let's see
> just some ambient lighting so that it
> can be able you're able to sort of see
> where you were at but there's also
> flashlights so hopefully it won't be too
> bad and I'll just make this one Knicely
> highlight it
> [Music]
> copy this one over to here
> and now the cave has a little bit of
> ambient lighting so you can actually
> sort of see what are you doing it's a
> fairly rough concept will be probably
> doing another pass when we let me just
> save everything I'll do another pass
> when we have all the assets exactly as
> we want them and a better idea of
> exactly what wouldn't want to do with
> caves because caves are a fairly recent
> development are twice because they've
> been in the game for a while but we
> haven't really had a good asset set for
> them so this is all actually fairly new
> for me I've only really started doing
> this today all right let's get a little
> glimpse of the outside when there's
> night as well is there lava if you dig
> deep enough I guess I don't think there
> will be lava but yeah this is an idea of
> what the world looks like we've done a
> lot of were work on the perimeter so
> like the skybox that clouds the lighting
> the mountains in the distance so that's
> all been fairly new this area in
> particular rocky desert if you watch the
> previous stuff stream deserts are kind
> of my thing so I've worked a lot on this
> area and also the other desert which
> probably won't be shown today but is in
> the game so yeah let's see where the
> next cave is and let's put it back to
> mid-day there we go
> light
> let's see let's find the cave let's see
> we've done this now this is a cave
> thingy this one might be interesting
> it's a bigger one it's fairly open and
> do 30 or I think that was a pretty
> interesting one that one isn't in a tile
> that I can't get to yet here we go so
> this is sort of like a transition cave
> like underneath the level we all have
> internal names for all the areas but
> just so that we know what we're talking
> about we're like I'm working on the dune
> desert or I'm working on the rocky
> desert working on these canyons or
> working on the southern forests started
