### Transcript

> when do you think the main focus will be on fixing multiplayer and will multiplayer be cleaned up before release or that post release multiplayer will be cleaned up before and it's one of it's one of our focuses in order to get dedicated servers running um as for like when the main focus will be it's like i don't i don't think you can just throw a bunch of people at it and then it's i don't know if like adding more cooks to the kitchen necessarily speeds things up in a meaningful way yeah and then and then when you add more to the game the first thing that breaks is multiplayer yeah so it's it's it's just uh it's gonna be a pain that we're gonna have forever but it is gonna get better and it has gotten better uh it's just it just gets better slowly so that if you were to compare the state of multiplayer now to six months ago or a year ago it's way better than it was um but you know if we put all our resources into fixing every multiplayer issue now i can guarantee you in three or four months when we add new content or something uh we're just gonna have problems again and so it's not it's necessarily a worthwhile investment there's also the aspect of like maintaining uh the solution sometimes we have to make like very ad-hoc solutions to multiplayer right now and so a lot this has happened a lot where we fix multiple bugs and they just keep coming back in multiplayer uh just because like we need to change the way the systems works and when we change how the system works then they start like impacting certain issues and we kind of need to like reach a good point with certain systems before we can be like all right let's crack down on these bugs that's related to multiplayer and we've sort of like learned as we're going that like we can't get stuck keep fixing the same thing over and over again we have to move on there's an interesting an interesting analogy here i haven't heard this one before i've heard things like it but nine pregnant pregnant women can't make a baby in one month you know yeah pretty good so it's like if if it takes the one that i usually use is if it takes like a one person to dig a hole in an hour how long does it take 60 people it doesn't take one minute yeah the one i like is if it takes a program or one month to do something then if you throw two programs on it it will take two months yeah yeah yeah i heard that it was three months oh yeah that's pretty good too yeah you know the one it's like yeah what takes what takes one program or one month takes two programs three months something like that yeah oh i love it throw all the shade on programmers
