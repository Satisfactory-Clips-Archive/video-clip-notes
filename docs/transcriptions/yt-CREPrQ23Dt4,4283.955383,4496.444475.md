### Transcript

> am I trying to thought there, yeah so so a lot of people were asking like in the video like if we're gonna be able to Zoop blueprints I don't think we are all right no no we have, I never went into this in the build in the in the video but there is like different build modes for the blueprints because they do stack and like you can, what's it called Snap them towards each other and stuff like that and I think that's something that we're also going to be probably working a little bit more on it's like how the snapping will actually work because like if you have, actually let me jump into the game and I can demo a little bit, which button is it it is this one build a new blueprint Chef, no make well now no but I can sort of show it off here so, unfortunately you are you the jetpack and stuff like that didn't carry into the this Pawn but, we can make two so it should be close though let me kill it where did you put it it's I think near the waterfall okay I'm gonna go find it later we don't have time, so yeah if you do something like this, I'm just gonna do half of this for now the friend like wow amazing blueprint fantastic great job gonna limit this how yeah I'm like I don't know, that was you guys job well this is doing a good job what's that directory where it creates this menu blew my dude holy

> with this menu and I'm like so I guess I have to make this work on the back end though all right holy so, quick Creator like this essentially you're creating the menus that we have in the game essentially like with the categories and stuff like that this is easier to use than the way that we yeah it's so funny, cool cool guy whoops cool guy can I put Emojis here damn it all right whatever trying to crash the game on stream dude I love it it's gonna happen- I'm pledging for this, babe okay so the thing I was going to talk about is, if you place a blueprint such as this one, and, for instance this one you can snap to the blueprint like left and right oh this is a bit iffy here I found a bug you're holding control yeah is it because of oh okay you're not built yeah this is what I mean like there's different build modes for this as well so like it will snap differently depending on what, what build mode you're in, and I think it's also changed a little bit since I made the video as well because you used to have to have like the vertical build mode as well to be able to snap them like this, but now it's possible to do this but if I do this let's see if how this works because me and Mark talked about this yesterday yeah so now it snaps to like the it still has like the the whole blueprints, and it's like it's possible to like maybe have it so I have calculates like the bounding box for yeah I think this would probably be iterated on yeah, we talked about doing that but, but there are some issues I mean there's more things that we need to fix still as well so we will look into that further but this is this is a good point actually
