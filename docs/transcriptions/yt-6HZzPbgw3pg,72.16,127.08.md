> the ride so let's be friends no we can't be friends how can we be friends if you know nothing about me well I'll tell you a little bit about myself my name is Jace I'm straight on a pushing 30 I'm 165 centimeters or 300 feet into inches tall I way too many kilograms so that's 2.2 times too many pounds for those of you use pounds I love long walks my greatest strength is by far my modesty my greatest weakness is probably my tendency to overshare I trim my pubic hair don't miss anything for gin I routinely relapse back into old school runescape I love trolling on LinkedIn I'm what I like to call by squared that is bisexual and bipolar which means when I'm up I want to love everyone and everything around me and when I'm down on the south little poopy face which is interesting that coffee stand let me do this anyway safe Jack and brother Spence go any home double-decker bus but don't be too impressed I'm trash it both and what's YouTube video without some controversy Swedish Pizza sucks so if you want to be friends knowing all that that would be really great if you like Swedish pizza maybe you don't want to be my friend but that's okay I'm sure we can find some common ground anyway well that was embarrassing
