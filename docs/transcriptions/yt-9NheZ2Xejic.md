> will we be able to fully utilize a pure node in the future I guess what you're asking is about, MK3 miners they're over clock state, I think that's something that, I think folks have ideas for or something that we will address at some point but I'm not entirely sure how we're planning on doing that yet either either with like multiple outputs or, Foster or, yeah I don't know if we can do Foster belts because, it might might not sound obvious to you guys but like, the speed at which the belts move there's there's kind of a limit realistically the faster it goes it actually causes a lot of issues in terms of like calculations and stuff especially when there are frame drops and so there's actually like a kind of a like a limit to how quickly those belts can go and so increasing like adding a like an MK6 or something is not necessarily feasible unless we have a solution for it
