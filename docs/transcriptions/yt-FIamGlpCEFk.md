> and jump them in there dedicated service we can just quickly uh address that so we are working on stuff related to dedicated servers we haven't been able to work on dedicated servers uh since holiday vacation because of people that worked on educators up that until up until that point i need to stop talking like i'm on fire uh speed talking um what was i talking about so we haven't talked about we haven't worked on dedicated service uh uh after the holidays because the people that used to work on dedicated servers have moved on we are we've just got new programmers in and we are re-allocating who works on what um snook is talking like biden um and uh so we are going to keep working on on dedicated servers it's still on our prior list so to speak it's uh but that's not to say as we haven't like done anything that will like i said before we worked around dedicated service so even though we haven't worked on specifically dedicated server part we still worked on fixing multiplayer issues with which is the main thing that's holding us back from releasing dedicated service where we have to solve the client related uh blockers from multiplayer before we can put out any kind of dedicated server because if we do you're gonna run into issues with dedicated servers where you can't progress because of those client blockers and the way that you can solve that currently is the fact that the hosts can like fix that that won't be possible currently so that's why there's been such a delay with that um and that's mainly because multiplayer like yeah blockers as in virus no no no blockers like gameplay-wise so like if if there can be cases where clients can't dismantle certain buildings um or dismantle the hub or like input new milestone stuff if that happens on a dedicated servers you're like there's there's no way to progress um and like regular like latency issues that's also something that won't get fixed by a dedicated server by itself that's something that we need to fix you know by itself and then you know that issue will be solved
