### Transcript

> so now I'm gonna place the water extractors and, when it comes to like fluids in the game it's a little bit tricky to see what's going on and, it might be like this is a portion of the game where some people get a little bit frustrated because it's not super clear what's going on yeah and the pipes are they behave quite differently to conveyor belts it's not always like immediately as intuitive and that's something that you know perhaps maybe something we can improve upon, later but, yeah I'm not gonna care too much about making things even but so the important thing for me here is that I want to get like as even water distribution as possible so I'm gonna place one egg water extractor in the middle of the of the loop and then I'll place one at the start of the loop and one at the end of the loop, so that way as water is like moving through the pipes it will get like also evenly distributed by backflow and like you know pressure from from the other currents meeting and stuff like that, which is a dandy good old way to do this anyway a lot of people put in the chat the belt speed 60 120 270 480 780 there you go, one thing I'm also backwash not back watch, and one little trick I'm gonna do here as well is I'm gonna put I may have enough space yes good so I'm gonna also have the pipes, like float above like one problem when you're building stuff is usually you don't want like belts to like, intersect each other you actually can build like that if you want to like the game allows you to, because we feel like if you're making tight corners and stuff like that it's better that the game is kind of open-ended in that sense and most people if they don't want things to overlap they'll even if it even if the game lets them overlap it they'll find ways, they'd prefer to find ways not to overlap and it's again it's up to you how you want to play like we've seen some people who have big messes of spaghetti, conveyor belts and pipes just running all over the place and they they like they like it like that that's how they like to play so yeah I mean we're not going to judge we're not going to pipe shame or convey about shame anyone but you guys how can you sleep at night don't want to shame but yeah this is all always like super tricky to get right correctly oriented I think this is also something that we're gonna change in the future, because these like, we call them guidelines these like green lines that show up, that's that's actually just a prototype for the game that's actually something I made for the game, and it was just like let's prototype like easier way to like see what's going on I was like all right cool we can do this thing like let's try it out all right let's make it cool and then we're like all right put it in the game now like what like under gunpoint all right- I've never tried building, this is I've never built like, you know up on foundations like this before I would always yes so I'm gonna remap things yeah there are different ways to do it yeah exactly so I'm going to remove the foundation so I just want them to, yeah to like get a sense of where things are going this is a good method- I might I might try this myself sometimes yes we got the job it's kind of weird but we got the job done
