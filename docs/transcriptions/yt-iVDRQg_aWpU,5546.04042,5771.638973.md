> proud about i think i'm most proud about the fact that we did the muted bid on the [ __ ] past video yeah that was really good it worked out super good yeah yeah uh okay so let's see snow's nearly out of frame that's because i move around like a little monkey dude dude's wild yeah let's see here um why hasn't copper stain inverted fixed inverted mouse on vehicles has been issued for more than two years make them playable just you know upload that on the qa site or repost it as well just whatever uh and the team will look into it at some point uh it's it's also just just a little reminder it's easy to be like this this issue i'm having for two years hasn't been dealt with like it's not like we didn't do anything for two years we do it we've been taking care of a lot of other issues i know it can be frustrating when your issue isn't isn't handled in in two years but there's a lot of things that sometimes after two years we end up adding them for example signs um but yeah just uh let us know on the qa site that that's what you want and upvote existing posts so that the team can see will there be updates on experimental uh yes so the way i think we're gonna we're gonna like or rather the way that it usually works is that experimental you know the way when we push out builds or patches or whatever they go in a certain order right so first we make it our internal then we put it on like a little stage where only selectfu can access that's just mainly testers and then we put on experimental and then we put on an ea and it goes through that order almost every patch almost so you know now that we put out stuff on early access we might still put some stuff on experimental that we're testing that are maybe like more risky bug fixes if you will or like system changes or something that will like potentially solve issues but maybe we're not sure or something like that that will still happen on experimental so those two will still kind of like run in parallel for a bit um and then when we feel like yeah it was a good patch let's move it over from experiment to ea so like that whole process will still be ongoing albeit a little bit smaller like increments now than a month or whatever uh it's gonna be much quicker um because i know there are a few things that we want to try out that we're going to put on experimental first um with uh not not like new features but like some some things where like we can potentially solve some issues with some folks but we it's like too risky to roll them out on on on the branch that we have right now because we feel like it's quite stable honestly so we want to put that on early access first before we do stuff like that um so if you haven't played an experimental and you kind of like all right i've been on experimental i i i'm trying out the new things but now i want to play on a stable version then i would reque uh recommend moving over to early access um just so that you don't get like a weird issue or something if we're testing something else and that bothers you but if you want to help us try out stuff then stay on an experimental just before just ask before uh will it be update 6 next or 1.0 who knows you have to wait and see but you have revealed a date when it comes out yeah but update six whether it's update 6 or 1.0 will be out and get your calendars ready folks because i'm just checking my own calendar it will be out on the 26th of april that's for sure nice um yep can't wait so add that way for the 26th of april gonna be great updates yep
