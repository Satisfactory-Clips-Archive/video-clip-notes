> faking news about update six oh yeah update six I've take six is gonna be juicy update six is gonna be all about stuff and things it's kind of funny because, the plans we had for update six are like gone like we we had like not gone but like we we had an internal kind of like idea of like oh this is probably what's gonna be update five and this is probably gonna be update six and then like one month later we're like no which is good because that kind of like reassures us in the sense that maybe it's a good idea we don't have a public roadmap because we would have to stick to that and I don't think that would work out so not having a road map is pretty good I actually responded to a steam post today about that the reason why we don't have a road map is is because we want to be flexible and we also find that it it's easy for us to manage like player expectations when we don't have one I know that's a bit frustrating for you guys because you don't know what's coming, but you know it's it's way better for us okay nobody cares about you guys it's all about us okay, like if we had if we were to keep going with a roadmap that we used to have like we wouldn't have pipes for instance so it's really good for us to be able to, be able to like completely go the other way if we want to, and change things around it's also good for you guys even though you don't believe me when I say that but like pipes was a legit thing we're like oh this is this is a pretty good like meme thing that would be pretty awesome like for community let's let's do that instead of our original plan because obviously this is cooler, so, I think I mean I think it's yeah no no road map equals no disappointment that is so true that's the best way for us to manage flare expectations if there's nothing to be disappointed about you can't be disappointed right, so, my brain is fried today you guys you're gonna have to carry the stream you guys

> yeah get stuck on on you know the next update in the next update we want to look at 1.0 and it's kind of hard for us to create a roadmap for 1.0 because that's so many unknowns for us and we don't feel comfortable you know trying to communicate the whole path to 1.0 because that is 100 gonna change
