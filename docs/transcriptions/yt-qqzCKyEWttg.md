### Transcript

> eta in the next patch, so we're hoping to get it out like later like late october so I don't know what november that will be but I feel like you did that joke way better than I did yeah yeah for sure pretty much, but we're hoping sometime earlier remember elite looks over something like that for the next update it's gonna be a minor update it's gonna be like an update to fluids in the game, and like some caller life fixes and we're going to talk a bit more about this coming going forward but we also have another update coming up after that which is going to be like an engine upgrade update that's more like an optimization update, but that's going to live on experimental, more so so when we update so we've consciously decided to put like small features in this minor update because we want to like push that out and then keep that on experimental for such a short time as we can to make sure that that's stable enough and then move it over to early access because then we have a [ __ ] ton of like optimizations in like engine upgrade and stuff like that that we want to push over to instrumental and that can stay on experimental for quite some time for us to figure everything out and work all the new like code stuff in, nice jargon, and, let that simmer until it's it's it's stable enough and then move it over to early access, but we're gonna talk more about that once like the the fluid update is out, then we're gonna give you an update on what's coming up we're gonna give you an update on the update I've never read that joke ever before yep first time first time for everything first time for everything we need a counter for that if anything
