> when will programmable splitters be fixed, probably not until the next like update ish or whatever what's wrong with them there's a I actually know what the issue is now we have actually locate like like the problem with programmer splitters is like there's two issues with them, one is that they're not like balanced properly or something like they sometimes like items can get locked out going in certain directions so like you have to like re-set them for them to like actually filter correctly, that's one problem the other problem is that the the I think this is on smart splitters as well so this mission might actually actually be for them as well but, in the ui like everything ui wise in the game is like we don't we don't, when you change any settings it doesn't apply until you close the menu, but for some reason smart splitters and programmable spillers don't do that and that's a problem because it can cause like kind of like almost race conditions where you can have the menu open and like scroll around and then it filters as you're keeping the menu open you get like really quick succession of changes, and that can cause like pretty weird states depending on what's going on while you have the menu open, so that's that's another thing that we're gonna change in the future that they don't they only apply once you close the menu so we have identified the problem we don't know when we'll push that change though because we might want to do a kind of like a revamp of a little bit of how the logic works not like anything you guys would notice like I mean like in terms of how we've programmed the internal logic for the splitters because they're all we also need to optimize them a little bit yep
