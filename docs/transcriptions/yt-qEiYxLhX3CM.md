### Transcript

> what's happening why do big updates at all when it just releases everything in small bites so one so it's kind of like unfortunately two ways here because um there's also the aspect that we need to put out our game and we also need to think about you know it it sounds shitty but it's you know it's part of the industry we also have to think about how do we keep con like continuing the sales of satisfactory um we we also try to figure out like okay we have a big player base and we really we want to nurture that player base but we also want to keep drawing in new players so having bigger updates is is the best way really to to draw in new players to the game like having a big you know release of updates um really draws in new players and unfortunately also keeping you know that kind of updates like secret and making a big splash once it's revealed also draws in a lot more players but it also kind of alienates you know the current ones uh during the process of making that update so it there's a really difficult like decision there on what the correct balance is for that and that's mainly the reason why we're not telling you guys you know everything right now you we could tell you like everything that's coming you know in in 1.0 or like what we think are gonna come you know uh but the problem with that is also we build expectations that may we may not deliver just because of you know various reasons um either because like we didn't feel like we could um and we don't want to make pro promises like we don't want to say that you know like there's going to be unlimited resources in the game in the sense that like you can build how far like there are always going to be limitations to the game there's also going to be limitations of how far we can go into each mechanic and stuff like that the few things that we know for sure are stuff like we are going to have signs we know that we're gonna have a better train system like the signaling we're gonna have some form of like signaling system or collision or you know something like that four trains in the game um at some point um you know there are certain things that we know for sure that we want to work on and that's the reason why there is no like direct road map uh because we well the main reason why we don't have a roadmap is because we don't want to limit ourselves to time like time stamps um like we could say this is what we think the games can contain but the the the thing that we're kind of hesitant about is that we don't want to set up like we're going to expect to release an update like every so often or whatever um because we really do want to take the time we feel like we need to be able to implement stuff and the fallacy of the roadmap is that uh it can create it creates these like situations where we feel like we need to get stuff out and that makes us crunch so like update three was unfortunately a bit of a crunch period for us which isn't how we want to work um it creates like a deadline that even though we say like we shouldn't crunch and like you know we shouldn't the problem with that is that then we need to delay and then you get like the the the the splash from that uh with it being you know it's kind of it's frustrating like we don't want to delay stuff because it's frustrating for everyone um so we'd rather you know dish out things as we know when we feel like we are capable of dishing the map
