### Transcript

> what happens if an automated vehicle fuel runs out when it's powered with a fuel rod or another fuel source that only needs one to fuel the route does it continue, i'm assuming you mean for the like the next update that's coming because we did put out a video two weeks a while ago with how the changes to, automated vehicles that we made and, i'm pretty sure correct me for our own days because i don't fully remember but i'm pretty sure like once a vehicle like if a vehicle can't complete the route when it's getting fuel it won't run the route right like if it can't complete it when it's picking up fuel yeah like it won't leave the truck station until it has enough fuel to complete its route cool so i think that answers that question it will wait until it can refuel and get the right amount and it will do that at every truck station on the every truck station that is fed fuel it will it will stop and refuel to the maximum that it needs each time so yeah so we'll hopefully take like a little bit from each if you have multiple to complete a full loop
