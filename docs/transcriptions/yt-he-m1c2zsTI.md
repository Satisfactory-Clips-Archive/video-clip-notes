> what if you're both arachnophobic and- I can never pronounce this word but like allure phobic which is a fear of afraid of cats, you're gonna have a rough time satisfactory that's for sure, you know some folks have told us that they're afraid yeah of cats and so like we could I don't know do something about that as well but, one of the reasons we go with arachnophobia mode is because fear of spiders and not just the fear of them but like erectophobia the irrational fear of spiders like the the really really strong feeling it's not that irrational spiders are terrifying, but, like that that is like one of the most prevalent ones like amongst people in the world so we I don't know if we can make it like we still want them to be kind of scary like the point is that they're scary that it's that it's stressful when they come along like that's that's intentional we do try we are trying to create that with those singers but, yeah we think yeah this the there's the irrational side of it really that's the main point here it's not that we wanted to remove like the the aspects of the scary creature showing up like it has to be sort of on your terms you know in some way and when you have an irrational fear of something it's not on your terms anymore yeah, there is there is a mod, that that changes the spider or the cat faces to like random other stuff I know there's one that replaces with your face for instance, so if there is a case where you are when you have both rectophobia and what was it called, the cat one yeah the cat one, a look I'm going to check google yeah but how do oh yeah you can use the google like translate thing too yeah yeah the pronunciation isla phobia

> yeah, if that is the case then then you can check out the the modding, side of things and see if that helps yeah because I think there's a mod that lets you replace it with with whatever like an image or just a blank blank worst part of the spiders that noises are bugged and don't stop when they die yeah do report those things on our qa site, that is something that I have I think has been known for a while and we haven't really got around to in a while but, that's that's a problem thank you for doing this I have a bad fear of spiders have arachnophobia very badly I'm glad that it helps I very much dislike spiders and hate them but phobia is much stronger and I'm not on that level focus produces panic attacking nightmares yeah and more like actual like phobia responses can be pretty gnarly because like pretty much everyone is scared of spiders right but it's it's a different story, when you have like a full-blown phobia of it and then there are people that keep them as pets and I mean I guess you can do it I guess you can do that weird
