> so what's what's coming in the future when it comes to optimization for satisfactory what what's planned on your your backlog if there's anything you can talk about that we haven't revealed yet yeah one of the things i really want to do still is split the world in smaller parts because a lot of people are like oh my god when i cross this line my game lags it's like yep that's because you're loading in 100 megabytes of data and that needs to go to the gpu and and the foliage needs to rebuild so basically what i want to do is to split up the worlds in smaller sections and this way the stutter should be less or even not apparent so that would be the ideal case but we kind of have the workflow issue that the world is in a different branch otherwise we have problems with releasing updates because that means that hana and mihil need to work their ass off so we can release factory content so that's why that stuff is being slow on our side i guess right workflow reasons and branching and all the shenanigans cool the other thing i really want to make hardly instant splines but yeah that's that's something uh we've been talking about since since we made splines i think uh well just to break the ice i got it working but i don't yeah so they work but they're not worth it at the moment so yeah because there was a time when not even like the splines themselves for instance and then instanced and uh yeah the performance wasn't great at that point yep it's much better oh holy i guess that sums it up all right thanks ben for for all the
