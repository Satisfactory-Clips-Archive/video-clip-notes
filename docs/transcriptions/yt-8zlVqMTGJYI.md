### Transcript

> speaking of speaking of, last week because that did happen last week I think that was Saturday yes but Friday that was a video so sure it was yeah and I love that video oh you liked it yeah I kept it a secret for you I didn't show you yeah yeah yeah we we did like plan it out but like the actual like result from it I had like that video could have gone two ways to me like it's either it's like oh it's kind of lame like it's not really too much happening or it's a [ __ ] gold mine of just random [ __ ] yeah, and it, it was pretty good it was a lot of it worked out pretty good yeah yeah it was it was super surprising so like last week we did the chat GPT thing where they wrote, the AI thing wrote a script for the video but before the scripts part the scripted part of the video which I then sort of like presented, we just also asked some questions like when is, when is 1.0 gonna be, do they know do they even know what satisfactory is and, it was pretty cool and actually they did know what satisfactory was which was super cool yeah, and, yeah so here's a link to that video If you haven't seen it check it out but it was really really fun and the premise was sort of like I want to see you want to see if Jack GDP could make the YouTube video for you like essentially exactly yeah like and I wanna I wanted to ask you like well what features are coming to update eight and, yeah I just kind of see what it came up with it was it was interesting the spoilers most of the features like either already had we already one of the features was a multiplayer a multiplayer that was one of the features love it we'll we'll get right back on it didn't bring up golf it didn't bring up gold that's a bit lame actually I was hoping it would be like I was hoping it would like say something completely random like, we should add, I don't know motorcycles or something you know like something really random yeah yeah yeah most of the stuff wasn't that random I suppose like alien invasion was kind of random but what made it more random was Mason's b-roll for that which is incredible because you might think like oh Alien Invasion that's kind of like you know base defense kind of elements that's not that random we get that stuff all the time but then when you when you view it in a way that Mason presented it was really funny it was really like a flying saucer just like randomly abducting your factory Parts yeah exactly that's your base event right there that's true it does it does know me now I did tell it who I was it didn't know who it was, underwater Factory was good A lot of people in the comments were like hey actually that's a really good idea and I could I could I could feel myself just you know internally going hey don't get any ideas yeah and the AI wrote this this was not a statement of anything that we, yeah you can already kind of build underwater there's there's there's there's ways to do it I'm sure I'm sure, yeah but chat to me is kind of it's kind of like AI is obviously the thing that's kind of like going around the internet right now because there's there's a couple of services that people are really popular right now, like AI stuff is a kind of broad term too because it you know it refers to so many things what does a GPT stands for you know it means, great Personal Touch that's true, but yeah like those kind of like linguistic AI have have been around for so long but I feel like they haven't been this like fine-tuned until now like I've seen a lot of code examples where people are like tell it like hey can you write me a code segment that does blah and it kind of does it generative pre-trained Transformer gotcha I don't know if that's true or not it's probably yeah, but could you have to be people confidently lie its face off that's actually true when we asked what the, yeah what the recipe for hmfs are and I was like actually it wasn't even right at the [ __ ], what was it high temperature insulation insulation or something like that yeah, or high membership insulation yeah, and it was just like yeah it's just a fiberglass and rubber it's you know yeah I mean well you know, that was pretty that was pretty strange, the like the code examples that I've seen people do where it writes code or like you ask it to optimize code that seems really really interesting yeah you can kind of do that and apparently some of its results are actually fairly decent but- I found that like in using it and especially when it came to writing out scripts I could see that like it kind of only could do one sort of thing and that was just like broadly drawn on about a mundane thing, and and at first the first time you see it it seems it seems super impressive because you're like wow that's really like thought out kind of and like really like expansive the way that it describes things but then I ask it to like write a few more features and it's the exact same thing with a few kind of words changed I mean it's still fairly, impressive but like I don't know I don't know if you can it doesn't seem like so versatile that that you could make it write your scripts or content yeah you could maybe make it right one one video even then it's kind of lacks a bit of, substance but if you you know if I wrote, three or four videos using chat gbt they'd all just feel like the same video except I switched some words around yeah I think so but it was still so interesting regardless, and the other, practical applications of it can be, pretty, interesting too especially when like when it like we're saying with code stuff where sort of the results of that are how to measure quality there is a bit easier than how to measure the quality of a script yeah that's true yeah, because like one of my friends who also works in games he's a writer as a games writer and he tried it as well he was curious like can I use this to to actually like do my job so he tried to make like a he was making like some kind of, this wasn't for the game but this was like descriptive text for one of the like updates they did or something like that and he and he tried to like tell her hey we're gonna do this thing and you can write can you write me like, as a press release or something like that and it was just like super generic and he felt like he had to rewrite it anyways so he's like what was the point of this this just added work for me yeah, yeah maybe maybe it can be like, you know it could maybe generate like some ideas to spawn inspiration yeah I think that might be interesting at the end of the day you need to craft it yourself but you know we say this now it's really easy to say this now but like this is like one of the first like more mainstream kind of models of this right yeah I feel maybe there's some other ones I'm not sure but this is the one I go popularize who knows like in five years what happens or ten years definitely because like the more popular this gets the more like useful they've become and there's always like there's always like the ethical issues that comes with it as well and like the copyright stuff, but like the thought of like you know machine learning or you know because that's the same thing like AI is a very broad term because like chat GPT is you know a linguistic like interpreter as well right because it's also taking you're writing a sentence yeah yeah and it's interpreting like what do you mean and then that transforms into something it does understand you well yeah like pretty well that's accurate and that's hard and that's hard as well because like there's ambiguity God damn it ambiguity ambiguity issues with our land within our language right so like for a long time people when we were talking about AI people always like we're never going to get an AI that's good enough to understand everything is you say because our language has so many ambiguous issues so like we also have to solve that issue first for like a computer to like interpret what we mean when we say things yeah so it's but- I think it's really impressive I think we've come a long way there at least because jet GPT at least on the level that I've seen understands what we're writing really well yeah I don't know I think it's all like a lot of the AI stuff that's happening recently like, it's, it's clearly very very powerful regardless of how you feel about it and I think I think, we kind of need to respect it sometimes I see some stuff like online where people, they show like a an image that was created and there's like one obvious flaw and they're like well I guess we're safe from AI for a while I don't know about that like I think a lot of times those little mistakes are probably don't matter as much as we want them to matter you know in order to dismiss the whole technology I think the technology is clearly heading in a pretty serious Direction, and like cherry picking random little mistakes like that probably doesn't actually justify that or dismiss, where we're at with the technology so we'll see we'll see what happens, I think it's clearly really powerful yeah, because at least for like photography and stuff like that that that they've done that for a long time like Photoshop has the thing where like it automatically figures out like who's the subject in the photo stuff like that that's insanely powerful right now and that's been in the works for a long time and like- I'm really curious as to see what other like aspects of that is going to come because right now we're just seeing like I want to generate pictures you know with the diffuse what's it called like the the diffuse model or the the stability AI thing or like it's generating pictures from pictures, and that's like one area of use right there's so many other ways to do it that I know one thing that I always constantly get emails about is like, there's apparently like Community moderation tools where like it Ted texts like who's toxic in your community and stuff like that and like Community managers yeah Community manager is just our job interesting yeah and, you know if you have like content moderation stuff like that where like dick pics and and figuring out like that stuff yeah and I know that pubg and like fortnite and stuff uses like cheat detection until I figure out if people are hacking stuff like that interesting yeah so that's what I mean like that's not an AI That's Just model train so that's what I mean like with the AI being a really broad term because like we often refer to machine learning as AI whereas machine learning can just be image interpretation same thing there like it's not really like and then if you if you start talking about we freely use the word AI for like enemies and video games yeah a lot of times that kind of AI is just simply moved thing from A to B that's not even AI yeah, you know or with a few wave conditions like it can be really it can be really really simple and we'll still we won't hesitate to call that AI so yeah yeah so the term is growing and there's a yeah there's always like the ethical dilemmas with the copyright issues where you have like derivative work versus transformative work and like the losses that are coming up against stability Ai and stuff there's a really good I can recommend there's a really good quarter crew are like a YouTube channel that does a lot of like video and like cinematography work and they've yeah VFX stuff and they're really good at like adapting to new technology and they've been doing a lot of AI stuff they have a really good video where they explain sort of the ethical dilemma, oh that's kind of yeah highly recommend that video It's called it's it's it has a really, clickbaity title though so it might be hard to find but it's like something lost very ironic it's like lawyer explains something AI lawsuit or something like that, I can't remember what it is it's a really good like video explaining like the whole issue with with it yep I'd recommend they're Veterans of YouTube as well yeah for sure started with Cardinal digital right I think they used to work with, Justin one wait what's his name, his name is yeah I know is it Justin one is it wrong there's just some someone else I can't remember Freddie no that's a funny game player never mind yeah Freddy Freddy yes one, I'm an idiot yeah okay sorry yeah what is he doing nowadays pretty W it is pretty long right that's the one lawyer explains stable diffusion lawsuit it also explains a little bit how that like algorithm works as well because that's the thing it is an algorithm like at the end of the day it's it's not like a general AI That's like thinking and making these pictures it's it's it's you know what's not you're an algorithm no what if I am what if what if I'm an AI and you guys just don't know it you know how's that for an ethical dilemma right there or maybe it's not article yeah oh dilemma anyways but but yeah like in terms of do you know any like tools for AI that you think like would be useful for you in because, not right now- I honestly think a lot of these tools are just kind of gimmicky and I think they're just a launch board for AI to go on to do bigger and better things yeah and I think it's going to be all the subtle ways in the background which AI already does that that's that's like that's actually the major stuff so I don't know I was a little these are kind of fun to play with for now but I was a little inspired, because I try to use chat GPT, responding to people that dm'd me, as like a little experiment so but I only- I really really I didn't really use the response I got from the the the AI I mostly just like took what it said and like all right I just reword this and copied this and make it my own, like a couple of people ask me like what's the similarity between factorial and satisfactory, and it was like or like is satisfactory a factorial clone was the question I got and I pumped that into GPT and it was like satisfactory does share some similarities to factorial but in fact there are mechanics and blah blah blah I was actually pretty good it was a very standard response but it was actually pretty good like it was true like you know but but satisfactory has affected everyone so like it was dead wrong anyways all right so, so yeah interesting let's let's see what the future holds thanks for tuning in for the, second podcast episode yeah yeah yeah should have saved that for April no I actually oh I actually have an April wait okay well good let's talk about this yeah yeah yeah yeah I need to remember what it is though, anyways we're gonna check out some some Community stuff that's been made, yeah let's do it pass it on event review you're gonna have to delay for a little bit because it took an hour to load the save file so, I'm just gonna change the agenda and I have to stall for like two hours an hour because, I don't know if serious or not no but it took it it's a beefy so far yeah you guys remember we you guys had Jace GPT a few months ago do you remember oh yeah but like last year wasn't it wasn't a few months ago it was literally a year yeah that was for the day 10 months I think I still have that was a [ __ ] pain in the ass to set up that was funny, that was so weird I was on the train watching me on the Stream oh that was so weird so dumb yeah that was fun if you guys don't know what we were talking about we're talking about j-spot which was, when Jace was in Australia for a bit you were on vacation as well but for a little bit of it but I think it was like I think the reason why I did it that day was because you couldn't be on stream that day because you were traveling that day exactly yeah yeah so so we was on the train to Stockholm while watching the stream yeah that's what I was supposed to be on we just recorded Jay saying a bunch of random [ __ ] and then I just made like a script that I could just like trigger the video commands and I had like your like on loop as well just reacting like huh huh yeah I also had like if I'm talking to you like Jay's nodding that's really funny oh that was so good I love that you never broke the, the you never broke no no no no no no you stuck with it yeah yeah the whole time it happened it was it was all there what precious yeah dude that was actually you did legit record something for that though yeah you were like oh [ __ ] hella fresh and you left and you're like gone and I had a loop where you've been gone and then you just came back and be like there was one funny, thing when I came back they had two versions of me coming back one was just a standard just come back and sit down and then there was another one I think you sat down and ate popcorn or something like that yeah it's a food or something yeah yeah that was really funny and we recorded that the day before it was like literally the day before we're like hey would it be funny if we did this like yeah and then I just recorded it and sent us not yeah has Jace ever been here I would live there oh there was one moment I just remembered something there was one more you had like a super long like ah I would live there definitely that would go there live yeah yeah and I remember I accidentally triggered that somewhere and I was so surprised by like how long you got that set up can you replace me right now I don't think so, okay I don't remember how I set it up I think I had like one scene I think no I think I removed okay I actually remember now I actually removed it from this I have the setup copied but those the scene collection we're on right now doesn't have it okay because oh yeah right right because I did like another, I took this sometimes I take this whole stream setup that we have and just copy and paste it it's somewhere like on a I actually just get just make sure that we have like this setup ready somewhere so it's easy to install and I remember I removed that because it took up like it's like five gigs of just footage of you going like, -huh how do we know this is the real Jace I guess you don't blink twice if you're the real Jace well there you have it you don't
