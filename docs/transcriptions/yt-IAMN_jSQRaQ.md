> do you think you'll fix being able to build under the map or keep it because people like it i don't think we care too much about that like if people go out of bounds and build, like it doesn't really affect the the big the big old experience if people do that like this is it's the same thing with the whole clipping thing like if people think it's ugly or like i think it's annoying then they won't build that way and if people want to be crazy and built under the map then like who are we to say you're not allowed to do that yeah and i think there's like a level of fun there so when some people do that they you know you're like oh look i can't believe i'm pushing the game towards limits come it's kind of thing and i'm doing this i don't know if people find it fun so go for it i don't think it i don't think it necessarily gives you that much of an advantage or anything no it's not yeah this is fun why why remove fun
