everybody welcome to our weekly devstream where we hang out and we talk about the game and such, my name is snoot and I'm joined by shh what are you doing are you on your phone what are you you talking to dad it's it's midnight wordle started again he's like my god oh yeah the third try baby go yeah all right it was brilliant wow the [ __ ] epitome of professionalism right here had to get that out of the way I wouldn't be able to survive the stream without my mortal fix for sure all right how's everyone doing everybody hope everyone is doing well it is tuesday yet again, and we are back with yet another technical difficulty stream yes these tuesdays never end they just keep coming around and then we have to stream right it's kind of strange how that works yeah but I hope you're having fun hope you're all doing well hope you're, how are you doing snoot I wanna know I'm pretty good actually because spring is just around the corner bro like I've been out for five days now where I haven't had to wear a jacket it's in that feel the warmth from the sun oh yeah oh yeah yeah it's weird it's like when you stop and stare in the direction of the sun you can actually like feel the heat when you turn around you're like it's gone yeah- I, yeah cause for like six months of the year you don't even feel the sun anymore in sweden and then when I got off the plane here in australia I was like oh there there it is, and, I went skateboarding the other day and so like I've gotten much much paler living in sweden right and like pretty much only ever wearing like long sleeve stuff just to stay warm right I got much paler and then like and then I came here and then I'm out in the sun and I burned so bad my arms were bright red and like that doesn't really happen to me that was, that was an experience so yeah I've been cooking out here in australia I'm gonna go back to australia much to sweden much darker than than I have been for many years you gotta wear a jacket when you're australia then so you won't get burned it's so hot it's unbelievably hot yeah it is it is quite a difference compared to us where like right now it's 10 degrees celsius and that's like oh my god it's so hot outside I don't know what to do with myself yeah very good and meanwhile it's australia it's like what 40 30, no it's been like in mid-30s I think for the past it's starting to cool down it's starting to cool down it's like, you know but the thing is like you know it peaks at like mid-30s or something but but then like when you're trying to go to sleep at night it's 29 or 30 31 degrees as well it's kind of blur and you know this is after summer so it was much harder before I got here, yeah that is, that is quite a difference yeah yeah yeah I went from like what zero degrees or minus five into into this it was a spiritual experience yeah you know everyone always like goes away during swedish summer because like but like I feel like swedish summer is like perfect almost temperature like it's so good yeah yeah when it's like around 20 22 I mean that's fine like that's that's still warm but it's not like too much and you can still kind of wear whatever you want like yeah you know you'll you'll probably won't be too cold and even if you like wearing hoodies you could still wear a hoodie out it'll be a little warm but you'll still be fine yeah so I don't know I always feel like you should come to sweden instead of going away for this weekend yeah and then you've got like the infinite daylight you know where the sun goes down at like 11 000 pm or something like that yeah I don't know how I feel about that one though because- I get I have a hard time sleeping during summer because it's always bright outside and it was even worse when I lived in norland where it's even more of that we're like this is I didn't live up north far up north where it's like the sun never sets because that that's the thing in sweden you can live in a place where you never see darkness, like you can be outside in the middle of midnight and you won't be able to tell if it's day or night, but it was like yeah sun goes down but where we are the sun technically doesn't set like the sun goes below the horizon but the sunlight still comes up over the horizon yeah it's it's weird it is very strange you can see the sun set in horizon but you still yeah exactly you still see the sunlight in the sky and then it comes back up again yeah yeah yeah it's kind of weird yeah it's pretty cool though I guess anyways I don't know what we're talking while we're talking about this one we should be talking about final fantasy absolutely let's get back on topic here how I was researching final fantasy 16 the other day and I'm still not excited for it unfortunately really- I saw that they dropped the like final fantasy one remake re reimagining the final fantasy origins the one the one that's got like the d that they dropped like the dumbest trailer was like I'm here to kill chaos I'm gonna kill chaos I'm looking for chaos like that sure that was so funny and they dropped another trailer that's equally weird like dialogue but I'm actually kind of thinking of playing it because it looks like a cool game and it looks like dumb dialogue yeah I mean I never played the original ones sure no you never played the original ones they're so boring no they're pretty good anyways nothing wrong very good
