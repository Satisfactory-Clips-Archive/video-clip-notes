> is the foliage system getting reworked bro i i ask myself that question every day we've been wanting to rework that system for since i started working on the game which is three or four years wait i don't know whatever a long time that foliage system needs to be rewritten at some point, we just don't know when it's gonna happen because it's a huge rewrite that will fix the foliage books the multiplayer hopefully and make it also a bit more efficient because i i believe the foliage system accounts for like a pretty huge chunk of the network bandwidth sense
