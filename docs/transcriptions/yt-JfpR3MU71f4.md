> what, features do i personally want to be added to the game before 1.0, whole string like i think the major things that i would want for 1.0 are things that are things that are bugging me, in the game, and that's more tied to like the build mechanics to it, because i think there are still like a lot of edge cases there it's super annoying to build, and like edge cases where like snapping isn't doing what you what you think it should be doing and like, i would love to get those things fixed and getting a holster would be amazing that's something that i wanted for a long time, yeah polish, because because the thing is like satisfactory is a really feature intense game like there's so many things you can do in it already so i i get like a little bit overwhelmed by the game that like there's so much to do so i rarely do i find myself like oh i wish we had this thing like i wish we had a a chair that could hover and could sit in it and it exploded and serve your pancakes but you know like feature wise i think the thing that the big part of the game is really the build mechanics and i think that's something that i would would have want to see more improvement on, imo and i think we are gonna do that you know like i don't think we're gonna leave that unfinished i want that chair now yeah
