### Transcript

> what, features do I personally want to be added to the game before 1.0, whole string like I think the major things that I would want for 1.0 are things that are things that are bugging me, in the game, and that's more tied to like the build mechanics to it, because I think there are still like a lot of edge cases there it's super annoying to build, and like edge cases where like snapping isn't doing what you what you think it should be doing and like, I would love to get those things fixed and getting a holster would be amazing that's something that I wanted for a long time, yeah polish, because because the thing is like satisfactory is a really feature intense game like there's so many things you can do in it already so- I get like a little bit overwhelmed by the game that like there's so much to do so I rarely do I find myself like oh I wish we had this thing like I wish we had a a chair that could hover and could sit in it and it exploded and serve your pancakes but you know like feature wise I think the thing that the big part of the game is really the build mechanics and I think that's something that I would would have want to see more improvement on, imo and I think we are gonna do that you know like I don't think we're gonna leave that unfinished I want that chair now yeah
