> do you hate answering the same questions every week we don't answer the same questions every week we answer some questions that are the same every week but um there's still like a lot of other questions that we answer and i think that we individually choose that are like questions that you know uh we haven't really answered before um and and that they're sometimes nice to answer too so like we we pick questions that aren't always asked but we also answer questions that are because even though like y'all who hang out here every week might have heard every question there are still a lot of people out there who just like haven't this is their first stream here or something or they they missed a bunch and they missed the answers yeah and it's like it's it's like it's it's not like ignoring them doesn't make any sense so answering the same questions like when we do answer the same questions it's it's not it's not annoying we're just helping people man so it's like it's fine yeah it it's it's so true because like there are cases where you know someone comes in and they've never followed us or anything like that i ask a question and then people are like oh that that question is so like whatever like we heard that question so many times but like they don't know that like everyone's coming in and they haven't got a clue about that so like it and there really is any way any there really isn't any way to like you know make sure that you know if anyone comes in they should be able to know that this is the answer to this question right so um it's just part of it you know asking like responding to the same question and i see i see it too and like our discord and stuff like when people ask the same thing over and over again like i appreciate that people like don't shut people down when they see like the same question over and over again just like that's just the nature of how it is uh you know so yeah
