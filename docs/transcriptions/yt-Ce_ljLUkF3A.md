> will most of the crashes and bugs be fixed in update five full version you mean early access I guess, well you know most of the crashes are fixed, there might still be some crashes but most of them are fixed, but you know we'll keep working on any crashes if you experience any make sure you put them on the qa site let us know, I'm crashes I guess I'm sure they'll stop too much right because we get that reporter thing yeah yeah I guess I guess if they're yeah no that's actually true james because like if if you put if you have a crash situation where like we get reports and we're like I don't know what's causing this like it might be good to put on a qsi like exactly what you're doing to get that crash so no you can provide more information yeah, other people can sometimes comment as well and and give more context yeah so it's still better to do yeah I revert my statement yeah I mean- I don't think, the the like the game's not going to be crash or bug free for the early access launch, of update five in the same way that the game has never been that in in that state yeah for us on any early access launch for any update before and so it really is this like balancing act of like when is it like for the most part stable enough so that we can continue moving forward I and like we do fix like a lot of the issues and we continue to fix them but sometimes, but we we do need to it's just a balancing act you guys like we have to at some point we also have to move forward so yeah we have to pick a point where that makes sense
