> features are available okay so there's like a couple settings or features on the dedicated servers like right now we have a setting for whether or not the server should pause if there are no players connected or not uh we have a setting for whether or not it should create a auto save when someone leaves um yeah sort of things like that there are like privileges as well so like there's administrators and just regular players so admins can uh change all the dedicated service settings um whereas players can only play and they can't really do anything else admins can also manually create uh saves or load saves even on the dedicated servers too you can copy saves to and from the dedicated servers like saves that are made on the servers are compatible with the base game so you can take that and play locally if you want however currently you would need to manually go into the server to copy it over yourself we do have some ui for some of these features not all of them and we do have ui i think to copy uh save files to the server but we don't have ui yet to copy servers from the server back to your local machine but you can do that manually if you want you can do the other things that you would expect like creating a new game changing passwords uh giving other people administration privileges via like a password field and things like that you can change the server name you can run certain console commands you know if you're an admin as well yeah a bunch of different things that you can do on the dedicated servers however i must say that like the ui of things right now is not really completely done a lot of brushing up to do they're just kind of like smoothing over the edges of some things a lot of features um don't actually have support in the ui just yet but that's gonna get improved upon uh over time so yeah this is all a complete work in progress but you know again the point here is they they run and and uh if you if you're able to jump through a couple hoops then then you'll be able to play with them and uh yeah i highly recommend that you check the wiki again for for more information how many people can fit
