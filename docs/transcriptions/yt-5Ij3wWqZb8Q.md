### Transcript

> turbo fuel for jet packs that's something that we've, i'm pretty sure we're gonna do it at some point pretty sure mark has told me also that we're gonna have it at some point the the reason why we haven't had it is because we've had issues with like ux where like you can't really pick the fuel, and i guess now that we have like that, venn diagram no the circular god damn it i forget the name every single week why do i even bother like why do i even wake up i can't do anything i can't i can't remember anything, radial menu thanks ah geez, now that we have the regional menu maybe you can do it make it so that you can pick what fuel you want to use in the, jetpack but i don't quite know exactly how that would work either because like you can't just use it like like when would you use it when you pick it or anyway, so it's a bit of a ux problem it needs to solve, and, once we solve it bam good times but until then we're gonna have to deal with that we can only use what is it solid biofuel in the packs i haven't used them in a while dude you are struggling today oh but i believe it it's not my day my week or even my year or whatever
