### Transcript

> somebody asked what are your thoughts on the steam what's it called the steam thing the steam deck is that what it's called, I am sort of hesitant but- I don't like I don't I don't want to be one of those people who like shut down new stuff like it sounds a little bit good too good to be true, and like given the track like the the past ex experience with hardware from from steam or from valve I've been that impressed, except for the, the latest version of the the index I think those are pretty rad but the problem- I really had with the steam controller was the buttons felt like trash and I think they're using the same buttons for the steam deck so I guess that's going to be my biggest minus, like even the switch I think will have better buttons than that that's the only thing that like annoys me right now but, maybe it's cool maybe I'll get one I don't know I don't want to like people that I hyped for it don't like be hyped for that [ __ ] like it it sounds very cool I'll I'll I'll wait until it's out to to like judge it so those are my thoughts my my rombling steam pad was weak sauce I didn't know there was rumble in the steampad so I guess you're right yes it was weak sauce
