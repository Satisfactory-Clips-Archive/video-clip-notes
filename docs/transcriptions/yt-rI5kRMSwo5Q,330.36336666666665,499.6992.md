> so last but not least we are gonna go look at the resource well now so let's check out the resource well first of all we can take a look at the well itself I'll give you guys a nice look this is the well this is nitrogen gas well you guys and then there are these little satellite nodes they're called all right and so we want to we want to get the gas out of these nodes so what we need to do to activate the, satellite node so that we can extract the nitrogen gas is we need to build the pressurizer on the the main node first so we'll equip the pressurizer we'll plug that on there it needs some power before it actually starts, pressurizing stuff to come out of these, satellite nodes so if I'll, just hook that up real quick all right so it's, it's gearing up it's doing its thing and the you can see now the satellite nodes on the outside they're all, you know gassing up just so you guys know this is still work in progress like some of these vfx aren't done they might change more might be added there's still a lot of visual polish, still to come so this is just work in progress but you'll see how this works so it's, slamming away and these nodes are ready to be extracted upon from so let's equip a resource well extractor I'll point this one towards that pipe there we can point this towards those pipes now I'm just placing them all down cool, and now we'll just hook them up

> cool they're hooked up okay so let's take a look at some of the ui here guys this is the resource well pressurizer so you can see that yeah there's some statistics for it whether or not these are the final numbers you guys that may change in the future just take it with a grain of salt I'm just showing it off for now okay but, and you can see that all the extractors are connected as well so if I if I were to delete one of these extractors you can see that it's like four out of five of connected right and then I can just rebuild the extractor connect the pipe and then it says five out of five again so this is sort of what it looks like the ui for the pressurizer now the extractors also have you know they're obviously they've got their own ui and this is kind of what that looks like yep you can see what it's doing now something interesting something worthwhile that I'd like to mention here is you'll notice that I can overclock the pressurizer but I can't overclock the extractors and that's because it kind of works they work together so if you overclock the pressurizer it overclocks all of the extractors now this is going it's trying really hard you guys so now it's, pumping a lot more nitrogen gas out so, overclocking these bad boys are really worthwhile one more and the final sort of ui update is gases, in pipes so you know the the fluids would display fluids here in the ui thing and this is what the gas looks like when there's going to be gas in the pipes so that's a little change there as well for the ui alrighty everyone I hope you
