> so last but not least we
> are gonna go look at the resource well
> now so let's check out the resource well
> first of all we can take a look at the
> well itself i'll give you guys a nice
> look
> this is the well this is nitrogen gas
> well you guys
> and then there are these little
> satellite nodes they're called
> all right and so we want to we want to
> get the gas out of these nodes
> so what we need to do to activate the uh
> satellite node so that we can extract
> the nitrogen gas is we need to build the
> pressurizer on the
> the main node first so we'll equip the
> pressurizer
> we'll plug that on there it needs some
> power before it actually starts
> uh pressurizing stuff to come out of
> these uh satellite nodes
> so if i'll uh just hook that up real
> quick all right so it's uh it's gearing
> up
> it's doing its thing and the you can see
> now the satellite nodes on the outside
> they're all
> um you know gassing up just so you guys
> know this is still work in progress like
> some of these vfx aren't done they might
> change
> more might be added there's still a lot
> of visual polish um
> still to come so this is just work in
> progress but you'll see how this works
> so it's uh slamming away and these nodes
> are ready to be extracted upon
> from so let's equip a resource well
> extractor
> i'll point this one towards that pipe
> there we can
> point this towards those pipes now i'm
> just placing them all down
> cool um and now we'll just hook them up
> [Music]
> cool they're hooked up okay so let's
> take a look at some of the ui here guys
> this is the
> resource well pressurizer so you can see
> that yeah
> there's some statistics for it whether
> or not these are the final numbers you
> guys that may change in the future just
> take it with a grain of salt i'm just
> showing it off for now okay
> but um and you can see that all the
> extractors are connected as well so if i
> if i were to delete one of these
> extractors
> you can see that it's like four out of
> five of connected right and then i can
> just rebuild the
> extractor connect the pipe and then it
> says five out of five again so this is
> sort of what it looks like the ui for
> the
> pressurizer now the extractors also have
> you know they're obviously they've got
> their own ui and this is kind of what
> that looks like
> yep you can see what it's doing now
> something interesting something
> worthwhile that i'd like to mention here
> is you'll notice that i can overclock
> the pressurizer but i can't overclock
> the extractors and that's because
> it kind of works they work together so
> if you overclock the
> pressurizer it overclocks all
> of the extractors now this is going it's
> trying really hard you guys
> so now it's uh pumping a lot more
> nitrogen gas out so uh overclocking
> these bad boys
> are really worthwhile one more and the
> final sort of ui
> update is gases uh in
> pipes so you know the the fluids would
> display fluids here in the ui thing and
> this is what the gas looks like when
> there's going to be gas
> in the pipes so that's a little change
