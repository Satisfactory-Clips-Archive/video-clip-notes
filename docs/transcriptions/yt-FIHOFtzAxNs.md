### Transcript

> well trains slow down for trains ahead of them so they don't need to uh a train can't run into the back of another train because two trains can't be in the same block so they will have already stopped stopped at the the block beforehand if you've got things set up right um if they but but if they do end up going to the same block somehow um then you've made a mistake with your signals and no they won't slow down for for trains ahead of them yeah trains will only stop for signals they won't care about other trades so yeah they will fi they will go full on into the night yeah if there's another train stopping like if in that example like if you have a train station or something where like you haven't accounted for the full length of your train and like a bit of us is sticking out to the other side if another train's coming in it's gonna bang straight into that yep
