### Transcript

> question uh uh what unexpected and surprising new features will be in update five i mean i can't really tell you right so without features that you know we we plan on i think we're gonna keep doing things the same way that we did with update four and that we're gonna slowly tease things as we go i think that approach worked really well and and so because of that i can't really talk about what's coming um because i don't really know what is yeah the other the other thing is things aren't always completely final like what we think update five is today is different to what we thought it was a month ago which is gonna probably change a little bit more uh and but become more and more fixed over time so it's it's really hard to like it's there's one element of like marketing to keep things under wraps and slowly release it it's good you know for engagement and things like that but also there's just the we don't know what's gonna change um which maybe isn't a bad thing you know sometimes you can just tell people stuff and it's gonna change and just be like that's how game dev is and maybe that's okay as well so
