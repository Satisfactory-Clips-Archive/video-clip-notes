> so i'm just going to comment on this real quick because i know there's a workaround for this so somebody mentioned that dedicated server issue you can't change the session from private to friends only it just reverts back we are aware of that one workaround in the meantime is if you grab the save file that you're using on the dedicated server, and open it up in your like single player session or your hosted session like on your own machine and then flip it to friends only save and then send that save file back to the dedicated server then it will work, it's a it's a shitty workaround but but but a workaround nonetheless
