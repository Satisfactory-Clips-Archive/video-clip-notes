> yep how does coffee stain feel about third-person camera mode I think we like the idea of it like that sounds really cool the problem with it is we would need to do a ton of work, to make it actually feel good and work well in terms of actually moving around and building and things like that it's not it's not the same we can't just like the we can't just use the existing mechanics and just like that's just gonna feel good, we need to do a lot of like redesign work to make sure that building actually works well in third person yeah so if we did do it it's not it's not a high priority on on our part because like we would do it and ultimately you're still left with the exact same game you just have a camera in a different position and it would actually take a lot of sort of buzzing yeah, and it would actually take a lot of, work to solve those issues so it's not a not not the highest of priorities
