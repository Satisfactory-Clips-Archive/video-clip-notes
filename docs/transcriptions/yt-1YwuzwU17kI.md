> do you guys have stuff that you kind of want to add but not sure, wait if i understand the question correctly if there's stuff that we think we want to add we wouldn't put in the qa site for people to discuss, not really, i think, the things that we want to add, the the best way for us to like reason around it is to, prototype it and see what we think, in some cases we we re-prioritize based on feedback we got on the q a side but it doesn't really change like or doesn't make us want to add like the q side is mostly the feedback we we get is mostly for like making changes to our current plan and like giving us inspiration to changes with the things that we've implemented but it isn't really like, in most cases give us new ideas but because we already have a bajillion ideas since before we launched the game and that list is like always growing, but the keyword site is great for us to confirm beliefs essentially so it's not like i don't want to downplay people giving us you know new ideas feedback feedback on new ideas because that confirms our beliefs so to speak but we don't draw like inspiration from the feedback side in that sense if if that makes sense if that explanation is any decent in any form of way
