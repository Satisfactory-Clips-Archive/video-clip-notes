### Transcript

> I want to ask you cheese too, because you also worked on goatson yeah how would you say like compar because goatsen was made on an unreal engine 3. how would you compare the two engine versions oh that's, that's like night and day yeah I mean the the native part c plus plus code is, pretty much the same but, going from unreal script to blueprint that is, that is a change what's what's the difference because I've never used unreal scripts like what's the main take away from that well I compared to blueprint that's, it is still a scripting language but it's not visual so it's like code you need to write it and there's syntax and there's a special compiler and it's slower than native code but I think goats in pretty much of it was written in, on real script and now in satisfactory we tend to do more in c plus yeah so in that way it's more performant and then we can do stuff in blueprint as well which is yeah it feels like a more complete engine definitely a lot of people are like that were like big on unreal 3 they're always complaining about how like the the ui in unreal engine 4 is like so much more bloated like unreal engine 3 had much more like you were directly in the scene and you like had like this tiny toolbar whereas now it's like toolbar takes up so much space and stuff like that yeah that's like the biggest critique I've seen on under android 4. I think as a programmer I'm avoiding the editor as much as possible so for me if the ui is a kind of clunky I don't care like I kind of think it's a bit nicer in the for in four but I guess I wasn't in the editor that much in, annual line entry right yeah
