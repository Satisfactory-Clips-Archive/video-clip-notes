> maybe a grapple gun so when, well it sort of depends right like if you get head butted off a cliff maybe it's kind of okay that the cut that like that there's a consequence for it apart from full damage but like you know that getting back up is a pain so that you try to avoid not getting a head butt off a cliff right but then there are things like the harbor packs and jet packs and things like that which would help in those cases too I mean so you know maybe like we can't put every cool idea in the game because then the game won't be very good that's just the thing with game dev you can't just put everything that sounds cool because if the balance gets thrown off then a lot of features become obsolete or the what's the word I'm looking for here the I can't think of the word I'm trying to think of but the, yeah just basically the consequences for everything you you do if there are none then there's no challenge
