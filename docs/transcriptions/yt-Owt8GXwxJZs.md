> is it better to comment on an older greater than one year suggestion or create a new one probably comment on uh an old one and upload it i guess uh making duplicates um will basically divide the attention on things it doesn't really matter that much anyway because you know we're not really going to be looking at numbers unless it's you know 1500 um we're not really looking at the number of up votes always like that's that's just one factor that goes into the indication uh like to indicate for whether or not we should um do it yeah a lot of like the majority of times it's when we're working on something that we know like this is the next thing to tackle and then we search up on the keyway side like what have people said about this thing that we're gonna work on um so like it doesn't matter how many upvotes i mean it matters of course how many uploads because we do see that like a lot of people want golf whatever stupid you guys go for um but uh like we will find the the small ones too um and and make sure that we can gather as much information as we can about certain things
