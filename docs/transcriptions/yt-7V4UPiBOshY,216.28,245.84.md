> your choice I actually just can't use the epic launcher it doesn't work for me or it's not supported for my OS now that really sucks I'm I'm super sorry to hear that the only thing I can say is that the epic games launcher is being actively developed it's not done yet so the only thing I can hope for there is that these issues will be addressed in the future the only thing I can say to you is bug epic make sure they know about it they probably do but bug them anyway hope I don't get in trouble for saying that and hopefully they address those issues soon so that you have access to the launcher but I don't want to have another launch
