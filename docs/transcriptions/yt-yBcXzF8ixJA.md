> yeah this is interesting are you guys going to put a throwback update 4 with chat reactions on the youtube channel so remember we did that with update 3 but we didn't do that with update 4. and maybe and i kind of regret the reason no the reason why we didn't do that was because of the rick roll i think in update four yeah because the update three one got removed i think no it's still there i mean they they claimed like revenue or whatever for it it's still there i i i go back and watch it every now and then okay so like yeah that's that's a real problem we should have we should have done that because it's really nice seeing chat reaction and it may be that that's lost now with update four and we might not be able to do that but i think with update five um no i'm pretty sure assuming we get a good reaction yeah yeah yeah i'm pretty sure i still have the recording though if you have that with chat do you mean with chat yeah i guess i think we can talk about that yeah yeah yeah but maybe we can i think we still have it yeah uh if we do we should try to put it up before update five drops cause i think we put it up unless unlisted i think that's what we did update four update four one yeah oh yeah i think so if i this this update four is actually like years ago now it feels like but it might actually actually when was update for april right march or something yeah uh it feels like a lifetime ago holy yeah
