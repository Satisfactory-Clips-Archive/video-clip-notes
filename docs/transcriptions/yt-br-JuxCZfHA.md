> any chance we can get the ability to manually dump items into the grinder instead of having conveyor belt them, you can put that on the QA site I think that's an interesting suggestion I think there's probably a chance that, the designers will be like no we actually want people to sync them via automated message methods so you would need to create a storage container and hook it up with a conveyor belt, maybe they they would like y'all to have that step but if you don't like that step you can let them know and they can take that into consideration
