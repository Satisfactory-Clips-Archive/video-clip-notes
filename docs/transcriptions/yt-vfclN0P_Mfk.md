> hey are you aware we can place water extractors in the air above water yes are you aware no i've never heard that i think i think i've seen pictures of that before there's been a few, community highlights i think when i've showcased that even if i remember, yeah i don't know it's legit there there i think it's a world thing where some of the i think there's two reasons for that bug one is like some places in the world have like some weird funky collision with the water level or something so there's certain spots where you can like place them on top of the water, but i think there's also like some snapping thing where you can move the the water restrictors in some manner i haven't quite understood how they do it but i have seen some streams where people like move them up in the air and some people have built like space water extractor bases, which look kind of cool but i don't think we're gonna love that at some point we're probably gonna fix that
