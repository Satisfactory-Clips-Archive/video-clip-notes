> any more info on train signals, apparently train like the the way we want to implement trains just get bigger and bigger every time we talk about it we've we released trains when we said like we are gonna make like some kind of signaling system or you know collision system or you know something with the trains, because the trains aren't fully implemented the way they are in the game right now like drive through them, and like there's been so many things happening in the back like we have the steam release we have up the three happened we prioritized that and like the the the train just like kept getting pushed back, and honestly I don't know what the state of it right now is, I do know that like we want properly like a proper signaling system in the game for 1.0 like we are planning to implement like proper trains you know, at some point I just don't know when that's gonna happen or like I don't know when that is slated to happen rather it might be update five maybe I don't know, that's me guessing, but- I don't know how like how that's been prioritized given like everything else, maybe maybe I should, try and bring this up again ask
