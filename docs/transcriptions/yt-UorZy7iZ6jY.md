> everyone lost their mind how the fluids work with that pipes barrels on conveyor belts and then this was when the game was only on Epic and we also revealed Steam support so update suntium cool huh cool huh wow need more videos like that, yeah there's there's so many yeah a lot of work went into that video and like yeah there's just so many stories around it that are like it's just interesting I don't know if I should I don't think I can tell them but you know like the guys who worked around worked really hard on it and they were actually kind of unsure about whether it was good or not I'll tell this I'll tell this one story, you know what I'll tell this one sir I think it's okay to say but it was, the main people who spearheaded the trailer was, I really hope it's okay to tell this story it's a I think it's a really good story but, the main people who spearheaded the trailer was, Christopher, our previous animator and Tim our previous producer, and they worked super hard on it and they they the night before I think they'd shown a couple people the trailer and they were like oh yeah it looks pretty good but they weren't sure they were just so they were like doubting themselves they're like oh I don't think it's good I don't think it's good and they were like literally just hang out late at night together and they just kind of like maybe we should just like delete it it's kind of that's literally how they were feeling they were so deep in the weeds of the work that they couldn't see what it was like from an outside perspective because they were just so fixated on this trailer had worked on her for so long yeah it's interesting, and then yeah like well it's not that they weren't unaware they were just so deep into the thing right they like there's something about when you're so deep in the work you don't see it for what it is you can't step back and look at it, and it turns out to be like one of the best if not the best trailers we've ever made, and it was one of it was probably the most hype moment we've ever had and, I know that like the entire Studio had this feeling of like how do we top it how do we top it but we had to like we had to like train ourselves to stop thinking like that because we would only quite frankly disappoint ourselves if we set our bar that high and didn't reach it you know and so we just we just do our best every single time and if it's not as good as update three that's okay we have good things that are coming anyway, I think we've made some really good patch notes videos really good trailers too and then we just have this like moment as a really cool memory that we can keep forever it's great we're not using BL Andrew's base in our trailers are you kidding me we're gonna scare people away they're lost in the source exactly Chris bacon yeah it was really good it was really really good retroactive hugs for Christians and they did such a good job yeah they did really great we've done some good stuff since done some good stuff since yeah clone juice was really good too yeah yeah that was the early early, versions, they're a little better these days I think got a few updates Boombox Charlie was really good and a lot of one thing I love about a trailer is the music is super good right a lot of the music is super good the stuff that we make, with, ghostwood Empire Dennis and stuff like that and and also like the music that I think I don't know if Yannick makes trailer music for us but he does like the music in game yeah ghostro Empire is super good you know I like this clone Jace thanks thanks real Jace is sleeping
