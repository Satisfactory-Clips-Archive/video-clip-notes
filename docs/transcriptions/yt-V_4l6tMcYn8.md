### Transcript

> what is considered done in game, most of the machine circuits that are done yeah they might be like recipe changes sure but they changes potentially one of the first things that we focused on finishing as soon as possible was like the whole how do you describe it like that the machine gameplay aspect of it so like most of the machines are pretty done yeah it's it's kind of it's actually a kind of weird question because I feel like there's not like a lot that's done as in like yeah we're never touching that again it's hard to say too because like I think they're definitely things where we consider like this isn't done and then when we reach 1.0 we're gonna realize no that was done because like you can always you can always keep working on the game for forever like the a game is finished when you decide it's finished like it there's never Aid when you stop working yeah yeah exactly the game is finished when you stop working on it yeah and, it's also one of those things that like it's it's always hard to know because I get like a game is not a bunch of individual features right everything works together and when you touch something something else moves and so like what might seem done now, might require changes in the future so it's kind of hard to know like but I mean like it's it's weird to say well nothing's done but there's it's a game that people have played for hundreds if not thousands of hours, so a lot of things are done in many ways but it's probably very few things that we we would say are absolutely final

> but a lot of things are very close to final yeah and just maybe need a few little tweaks and a Polish pass so no new machines will be added I think new machines probably be added so that's not what I said yeah yeah exactly yeah
