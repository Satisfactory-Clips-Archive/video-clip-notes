> more items more tears so I mean, we've I've talked we haven't talked about this on stream for a while actually but we have said this a bunch of times so, whether or not we add more tiers to the game we'll we will be adding more things to the game which will add more you know gameplay time as well as like different things that you can do right and whether or not that comes in a new tier is sort of beside the point because, a new tier makes sense you know if if that if the progression from one stage of a game of gameplay to another makes sense so we weren't necessarily like adding new things to the game and then just chuck them into a tier nine just so we can say we have a tier nine right what's more important and no doubt what you guys want more than just simply a tier 9 is new content that makes sense in the game and if that's tier 9 cool if it's not tier 9 I think that's still cool right hmm yeah but we'll be adding more things to the game
