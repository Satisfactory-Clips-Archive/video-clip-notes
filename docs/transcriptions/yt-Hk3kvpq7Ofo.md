> because we're gonna we're gonna get down to brass tacks chat we're gonna target some real stuff okay the real deal where's my little tool there it is switching the agenda yeah we're gonna talk about dave I'm almost gonna jump out of the discord quality, time to talk about the game what time is it oh it's fine oh perfect we're perfect on time right on time in fact one would say so yeah, let's see here it's been a while since since I was gone I was gone last week so we didn't have a stream then so I guess we should talk about the, the teaser trailer we put out I put out, no one's taking this can appreciate my teaser trailers that I'm putting my sweater tears into where is satisfactory t-shirt maybe that's it no

> there we go hopefully added to the playlist I did cool, yeah let's let's, let's really quickly play through the video again because it's a short teaser trailer, it will also remind me what's in it so let's check out the teach trailer yes what the hell happened with me there weird, so that's the that's the that's the new swamp biome that we've been working on, hope hopefully you guys are looking for that this is this is such a cool biome by the way, right now we've been, like we've been working both foliage and ripple willows by the way there are more dead willows going away, are there any willows left in the world now because I think the red whoa started raining like a mother outside, I think we've done away all the willows haven't we man rip what what a yeah nope there's more okay there's some more okay we'll get we'll get around to that eventually, but so so yeah this is essentially an overhaul of like a lot of the, the foliage has been reworked a little bit to get this more spooky vibe, we got some of these like I think these were there before like the ball thingies, pretty sure that the crash sites are still in the same placement don't quote me on that because I'm not 100 sure actually but, ball thing is but yeah essentially what we want went for here we wanted the swamp to be like a little bit more spooky, all the like, colors that you see in this is this biome they're part of like the the atmosphere system change that we've done, so this this is a, you're watching like a full day in the swamp essentially so like in the morning this is what it will look like it will have this like kind of caleb sort of vibe to it the the blood red sort of thing going on and this is like around 10 ish in the morning or something, where the red goes away but there's still kind of yellow happening, and then during midday I think this this got this like kind of pinkish vibe going on, and then oh what's that isn't that interesting huh, also rain going on here if you didn't notice in the first pass viewing, this is the second time we've shown off I don't think we show enough rain in the environment yet we've shown off like rain in our test level and stuff like that, this is still rain is still a little bit of like working progress, there's still a couple of like performance issues we have with rain so we are still working on that and we are going to keep working on that actually while the game is out on like experimental can it be turned off, possibly yes I think we will have features for that too if people want to turn it off I think it will be part of like graphics thingy where because because it can affect graphics a little bit, or like performance a little bit, at least right now but we're still optimizing on that, but it's like don't quote I'm pretty sure that there's going to be a setting for it but I'm not 100 sure, but we have talked about that internally so it's not like it's it's out of the blue, so, so yeah this rain coming, there's cats I don't know what to say here, more forest this this shot I have never seen people take something we've made and completely run away with it as much as with this shot, which I think is funny I think it's funny that people do this actually it's it's like half half of it is like, whenever there's like conspiracy theories or stuff like that you know we we sit back and we're like juicy, but a lot of people took notice on us very specific like a very tiny detail in this shot okay, first of all there's a bush disappearing here from lotting I've missed that when I made it but there's like a tiny there it is you see this like tiny speck that's moving here a lot of people are like oh that's that's like a that's like a spider we're like oh that's some new creature stuff like that that is that is a particle that's like in front of the camera it's the you guys have they're already in the game it's like the leaf thingies that are moving you can see some of it over here too, like it's just a part of effect in the world like I can't it's it's been wild seeing how people have gone out of the way to like analyze like these like tiny pixels like this this tiny thing in that it's ghosts but it kind of makes you kind of makes you, kind of makes you feel you can see legs it's the little like tiny like creature thingy in the fx you can see it in the game right now, or is it done all right anyways, and yeah this is essentially midnight so so this is like this is the atmosphere system in place sort of, that and I think this biome is the one that's got like the most, like when it comes to the atmosphere and the the new fox placement and the atmosphere system this I think this biome is the one that is changing the most out of all of them, like I said before it's kind of wild seeing the old images of satisfactory like in in, of like the world because it's both we both have I don't know if we showcase this properly but we have like a new, do we have that in any video wait let me dive into that maybe it's shown in the equip no sorry in the which video could that be, the radar tower video, let's see here this one stupid thumbnails, where's the opening shot you got snowden's note action going on here again, over here yeah so so we haven't been able to like fully demonstrate this I think, maybe we have time for it in the next video maybe we'll see but, like the sky system has got like a different like we're using unreal's new, cloud generation system so like the clouds are much more dynamic they come together and like they form and they create overcast and stuff like that it's really cool and they create like clear skies too, so so like colorize and like ask your as time goes on in the planet, are like vehicle lights fixed yet we'll talk about something else

>, like the atmosphere system is really different in update six, and it's it's probably not like if you if you don't know about it you probably won't notice it too much, but it is quite different and I think the swamp biome is the one where it shines the most like the fact that it's so it works differently, because we haven't been able to get like this like vivid sort of, color changes to biomes before so I think that's something that we're really stoked about and the fact that like we managed to get pull off this kind of vibe with the fog and all that stuff in the swamp as well so yeah we're looking forward to seeing what you guys do in the swamp if you do anything in the swamp or just avoid it completely maybe it's too scary, but, yeah that I think that's that's pretty much I mean that was a teaser video so it's pretty short so it wasn't too much to talk about I guess but, yeah very cool very cool yes so yeah update when that's the that's the question everyone's mine soon as it turned into june, so I think we were a little bit optimistic when we said early june because kind of is early june and where's the update am I right, yeah oh no so we don't have a date today really to to share with you guys, but we are working very hard on it and, I think I think it's gonna be sooner, than we think but probably later than we hope you know what I mean, so, so yes so it's late june yes maybe I'll we'll see,
>

> we we like we will let you guys know it's essentially as soon as as we have like we feel confident that we can share our data essentially, but I guess one thing I can talk about though that I think is kind of important to bring up in this, because we like this release is going to be different is essentially the the tldr that we're getting down to here because couple of reasons if you have seen our early videos where I talked about this, before you probably know where I'm going with this but essentially one thing that we've realized when we're working on satisfactory is that we feel that we keep moving the goal post when we're making these updates because we keep thinking how do we package these updates and they become bigger and bigger and we end tend to do more scope feature creep scope creep whatever for the entire game and I think the intention for us at some point is that we will finish the game at some point hopefully soon-ish and when I say soonish I mean like within our lifetime in a sense because this is one of those games we could be working on this game for forever and we can be in early access for forever and I it's it's like part part of it is we don't want to keep working on this game for forever, we want to sort of reach 1.0 and feel like we're we're in a good state and to be able to say like we're proud of what we made we also feel it's a little bit scummy not scummy I actually don't care too much if a game is in early access forever so be it you know like if it's still good then the game is still good, but for us we don't want the early access stamp to be forever we've been in early access for three years which you know in in the grand scheme of everything you know when it comes to making these type of games I don't think being in earlier three years is that long honestly because you know think about how ambitious these type of games like that we're making not us but like other game developers you know we like if we weren't ha if we didn't have this like early access model- I'm 100 sure that a lot of games would have wouldn't be made so I don't know I think it's a really good business model and we've gotten a lot of really good games because of it and hopefully you guys think that satisfaction is one of those games that feel worth being in that early access category but we want to be in 1.1 eventually we want to be able to like patch up all the things that we've been kind of annoyed by be able to fix all the bugs that you guys have been annoyed by and be able to like package everything and say like this is the this is the final version of satisfactory this is this is what we intended satisfactory to be this is what we're happy with because the main reason why we we went to early access in the beginning was because we didn't feel like we could finish the game essentially within the timeframe that we had we wanted to release the game you know,
>
> [Music]
>
> in a finished state when we launched the game but we we realized that we would be need to cutting so many things that we wanted to have in the game and we wouldn't be able to have pipes we wouldn't be able to have like, you know as intricate systems that we have now so so that's the main reason so so tldr we want to reach one point eventually, and one thing that we realized is we can't keep doing updates the way we've done in the past because they sort of chip away on like you know we take one step forward but we also add another step in between before reaching 1.0 and we just realized that we can't keep doing that forever because yeah we're moving the goalposts for ourselves so so starting from this update we're going to do things a bit differently and from you guys's perspective, up until this point it probably hasn't look it does probably doesn't look like much of a difference I mean we also thought that update 6 was going to be a smaller update it is a smaller update you guys keep thinking it's not but it really is compared to all the other updates and, it's also going to show in the way that we roll out this update because we are going to roll it out on experimental and it's going to be an experimental for a bit longer probably, than previously and you're probably not going to get the entire update 6 on like the first day, so like if you're waiting for like that launch day of update six or whatever you're probably not gonna get the full picture sort of you're still gonna get treated to a lot of stuff but you know yeah scam exactly you're getting scammed,
>
> [Music]
>
> and and you're not gonna get the full picture of update six we're gonna keep working on that we're gonna stick around and experiment a bit longer we're gonna drop feature updates on experimental and, and then once we feel like we can wrap up update six we're gonna move that over to ea and then we're gonna keep working on like the next couple of things that we have planned, which won't necessarily be like I don't know exactly what we have planned after this but it might not be another update it might just be like working on you know fixing something specific with networking or implementing something else with, I don't know graphics I don't know and we haven't talked so much actually what we're doing with up6 but, what I'm trying to get here folks is that the update that is coming next which is update six is is gonna be a different update it's gonna be like it's gonna be released in a different way, it's gonna change the the timeline a little bit we won't have like a patch nose video for this release either because it won't be done so we're saving passions video for like the ea release this time around, and yeah bob's your uncle so so that's whatever so like if you are waiting for like the day that we drop up at six like just be aware that you know it probably is going to be a bit more buggy than usual and I mean we've said that a bunch of times and people are still like oh it's still fine but whatever but, yeah we're gonna do like more incremental updates off update six you're gonna get you're gonna get like kind of early access to update six essentially I think, because, yeah that's sort of that's what I'm trying to get at here essentially that's that's sort of the state of dev that we have today is that we are we are closing in on our release but we don't know exactly when that will happen there's a bunch of stuff that we still haven't actually there's a few things we haven't shown off yet we still have a couple of the ai changes coming and a few other things actually that is pretty exciting yeah early accident relax but it's not in early access it's an experimental so it really acts as an experimental which makes sense so so yeah so yeah cool, I've been away a couple of days so I probably missed a bunch of cool things happening at the studio last week, but I think I think that's the latest on state of dev for our game is that we we don't have a release date unfortunately yet for update six experimental launch, and also important note experimental launch is going to be different, it's going to be more of an iterative iterative launch you won't get everything in update 6 on launch day because we kind of need to keep working away on it in chunks and it's gonna stick around an experimental bit longer tldr there you go
