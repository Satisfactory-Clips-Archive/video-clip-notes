### Transcript

> yeah are there spiders in this build I don't know are they in on this one I think they are no I don't think so I think the spiders are a little bit later later I don't I haven't seen anyone honestly there are hardly any enemies in this build actually there's the hogs which is yeah they're way harder to like aggro in this build so like you actually have to like be really close to them this version, but they have very similar like they don't do the circulation thing or like they don't run around you in like a circle yet they just go for you and that's that's it so they don't have a lot of logic to them really easy to avoid
