> are you excited for The Last of Us TV show next year, I didn't really get excited for a lot of new things I think I feel like I'm so jaded about a lot of different things that I'm always cautiously skeptical, so I don't know I'm not I'm not excited I like the last of us I'll watch it I have no expectations I'd love to watch it and be blown away and have a great time but if I watch it and it's like kind of meh that's okay too I will say that I'm glad I think I'm glad that they're doing it I get the feeling that Naughty Dog are you know a studio that like, care a lot about their IP and that regardless of how the show ends up working out, that they're they're gonna give it their best shot and, like a really you know honest attempt at doing their best and that's all we can ever do is creative creative people can only ever do that sometimes it works in the end sometimes it doesn't we'll see they used to care until last of us too I disagree I think that loss of us too was amazing and it's very clear that they cared a lot about that game, this is another weird thing you know like with video games sometimes like I said like I was just saying sometimes with creative things you can't please anyone everyone and sometimes maybe the reception is mixed but that doesn't mean that doesn't mean that the developers didn't do a good job and doesn't mean they didn't care all right so just because you don't like last of us too doesn't mean they didn't care doesn't mean they didn't give it their all maybe it just wasn't for you I loved it I thought it was great
