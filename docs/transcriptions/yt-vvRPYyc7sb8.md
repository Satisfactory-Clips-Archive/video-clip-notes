### Transcript

> plans for a map editor ah I don't think so buddy, the the thing it's not impossible I will say this but I don't think we will be the ones do implementing that I think that's something maybe models modders will be able to do in the future but the thing is the way our streaming system works because like we can't have you can't have the whole map loaded at the same time right it's too big there's there are too many assets and it's just humongous there's too many things going on at the same time so we stream tiles in of the game and each tile is like also not uniformly sized so it's very it's it's a show to be honest, but that's the case with every game but it's just too complicated to to make like a good streamlined level editor out of so I don't think that's gonna happen, from our perspective and I think it's very difficult even for modders to to be able to do that, given the like share size of the map so I think that's unlikely
