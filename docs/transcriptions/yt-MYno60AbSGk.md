> i think that would be really cool, will there be a map editor or something like that for, custom maps for the community, currently select with the, modders the unofficial motors, they're not really able to make that work and so i don't know how we would go with making it work i'm not really sure what the limitation is there yeah, but it would be cool it's possible that it might even be more complicated after we add the new, the way we handle streaming levels that will probably mess up maybe a few mods actually now that i think about it, i don't know but we're working on like a new system for how we save and store, objects on the map to kind of like reduce the amount of streamable stuff in the level, and it's possible that like maybe that makes it easier but it might also make things harder i don't know, but apparently like any kind of map editing is kind of difficult right now for modders but i mean it's not impossible that we look into waste maybe we can solve that for people wanting to make mods for methamphetamine
