> real quick is that some people have been pointed out to us that mods are broken yes um that's not something we can do anything about so currently mods aren't officially supported so these are our modding community that have been working really hard on on fixing this and working on it and they're still working on it and i also want to say that if you're running into crashes and you have mods installed you're kind of on your own unfortunately because there's no way for us to verify crashes uh whether or not that's something because of the game itself or it's become something of mods currently like i think 80 of our crash reports are because of mods and if you are getting issues please reach out to the modding
