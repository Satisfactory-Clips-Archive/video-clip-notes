> I'm sure we can do it, will you be adding more cargo crash sites, to add more alt recipes, we still have I think we have enough left right now like there's more hard drives in the world that are than there are alternate recipes so we can get away with it for now do you think it will check though yeah do you think it will be a situation where we want like the same amount of alternative recipes as there are hard drives in the world or do you think we'll always try like have more hard drives available I think it would be good to have more hard drives available just in case someone for some reason loses it or drops it when they die and they can't find it anymore those kind of cases you just be yeah limited item like that I guess that's something in general that we haven't really solved that that same issue exists with the hub parts where you can you can lose your hub part and we have some systems available right now that try to mitigate that but it's still like an issue that if you lose your hub part you're essentially screwed, and I guess the same goes I guess you can still progress in the game even though you lose hard drives it just sucks that you can't access everything if that happens to you I mean yeah it's a nice thing nowadays that are there are more than you can use yeah, yeah it would be really, if the game ends up having the exact same amount and we haven't fixed that problem and I guess there might always be this edge case where you could lose a hard drive for whatever reason so it would be best I think to just make sure there's enough more than enough hard drives to go around all the alternate recipes gotcha
