> yeah will there be an update of walls for some half walls so function like that or diagonal walls I know this is something that a lot of people are wanting, it's possible in the future but there's a little bit of wework needed there same goes for because it has to do with the way we do collision checks, but it's not impossible, I think I think the main problem for us actually when it comes to doing that kind of stuff is that the build menu gets cluttered, so I think we'd like to do a solution to that as well if we were to implement half more stuff like that it might also be the reason why we don't have like a lot of cosmetics right now because that's a problem we kind of want to solve as well
