> will there ever be a way to move a section of a factory in-game instead of having to either delete or rebuild everything I wish, I think the answer is gonna be probably not but you never know it depends a little bit because I think, the main reason why we haven't done it is because it is tricky to do it's tricky to implement, and it's also like a ux from a ux like user experience perspective, like I think if we would want that kind of feature we would also want it to feel intuitive, there's a couple of mods that allow it but the mods feel kind of like they feel more tired like they feel more aimed towards like power users so it's people that are more into attuned to like using more complicated like solutions, but but that's not to say we'll never do it it's just that we haven't really like it's not been a high priority for us in comparison to a lot of other stuff, obviously we could like prioritize it higher if it's something that a lot of people really want but it's not something that we also see like a huge outcry about, and it's also like some it's also like a piece of the game that's been like kind of picked up by the community in terms of like mods and like the editors that exist, to sort of mitigate that issue, so like there are solutions kind of available now so yeah that's why we haven't like prioritized it currently but if you want to be able to do that make sure to upload it on the keyway site and let us know how important that feature is to to everyone so yes
