> uh what's your opinion on hypertube accelerators once they're possible to build want to be convenient to add them as an item so we talked about this actually just last last week so adding hypertube like accelerators or adjusting the speed on them or or whatever well the the hypertube speed up bug thing in itself has been left in the game because there's a trade-off and the trade-off is their tds to build and excess power right uh if we added in a game and in the game as a base thing and making it convenient that takes away some of the trade-off all right so you're right adding it in the game would make it more convenient but we need to balance it right and so the inconvenience of making it plus the excess power that you need to use plus the like uncertainty of where it's going to go like it's kind of kind of hard to set up right like that difficulty kind of the gain you get from that is is kind of offsetted by the difficulty to set it up so i don't i don't think it's going to be added and it but if it is there'd have to be something done to it to make it um more balanced yeah i guess but i think also we're kind of proud of the fact that it's like an emergent thing that happened that like we didn't account for so it feels also like we lose out a little bit on that prestige that the fact that that is a thing in the game then it makes it like easy to build
