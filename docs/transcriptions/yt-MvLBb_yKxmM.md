### Transcript

> so patch note mentions network scalability options what is the change really so the without getting too technical about it but it essentially has to do with um the transmission rate and the the how much like the the bandwidth you're receiving and uh sending um there's a there's an issue where if you're on a network that has um like if you don't have good internet access or um if you're behind like a like a big fire all or something like that where your your bandwidth slows down um if you if we try to send like too much data at the same time then you can end up in a situation where the game is constantly like waiting to like receive and and transmit stuff and like confirm that like i got it and like stuff like that um and if you if you're sending too much in a too short time period then if you're on a slower network that can lead to way worse network performance than if you would just like you know decrease the amount you're sending so like instead of sending bigger chunks in bigger um cycles you can stand smaller chunks in in smaller cycles and you know depending on your network's speed that that affects you differently uh and we've been trying to like keep it down so like we make sure to capture you know everyone um but we feel that we we feel confident now like upping that a little bit because we feel like people are playing the satisfactory have tend to have pretty good internet access um so when we've been checking out tests and like also following like recommendations from from epic about this we felt that maybe we were a little bit on the low end and we were trying to optimize a bit too early so we've upped it up a little bit so the default like values for for network is higher now um so potentially that can solve some issues before where like you know if you were trying to connect to someone you weren't able to connect now that's possible that's fixed and it's also like you know general performance overall you might see better like better sync fixes like not as many sync issues as before but like this is this is kind of like me dumbing it down a little bit obviously it's way more complex than this um and it it doesn't guarantee that it will solve like if you have a specific network issue or if you were seeing sync issues before it doesn't guarantee that it's fixed in those cases because it really is like we have to find like different optimization for different things when it comes to networking to fix different issues sometimes it's us fixing how we're doing things sometimes we have to remake the system and how we like sending data overall but potentially this is something that's going to be better for everyone so yeah
