> it's it's like always hard for us to just like set a date and then you know anything can happen in between then and now development is really it goes really back and forth like sometimes you know we we implement something that we think we want to do and then we don't think it works out like maybe ux wise or maybe we want to change something you'll feel like a feature is bigger than we thought um so it goes back and forth a lot so um and i don't think we even have an internal date currently um because once we got back from vacation we sort of felt that like even sort of the internal deadline we had was too optimistic but it's still like for you guys to still fall it's not like yeah it's it's fall you guys okay
