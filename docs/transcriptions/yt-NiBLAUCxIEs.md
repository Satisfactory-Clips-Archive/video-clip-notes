### Transcript

> website they can't plan for it so to speak what about mk6, belts, this is like a question that I'm like it's a weird one I can't like I can't say no because because I like maybe yeah the problem with else that we have right now is that the update the way we update items on the belts is it's not like it's it's kind of frame rate bound the way it's implemented right now so if the like you won't notice it but on the faster belts like the mark v belt, if you have a poor frame rate then you won't get, like the same amount of throughput on the belts so we're kind of hesitant on like adding a new belt speed before we solve that problem, so I don't know what this what the state of that is it's kind of similar to the way pipes work with the fluid rate I think, because we can't just like up the fluid rate however we want, so we'd have to balance like get that working as well if we were to improve pipes and, yeah that kind of stuff
