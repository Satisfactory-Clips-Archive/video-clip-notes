### Transcript

> see this oh this is another thing that is so this is the way we used to that we've been doing it we actually had to change to layout fields these used to be declared specifically I think this is a change in 425 it might have been 424 and we had to have a custom serialized function which best in all these parameters but they've flattened the structure of everything and so it can basically it has to do less cpu calculations it can it knows the size and that's what this, macro is doing a little bit this is a there's my cat this is a little weird to me too because this is actually from their code and then it says it's a legacy macro declaration I'm going to leave it but I wonder if it will switch in the future to using that and what this is doing is stating the type and matching to a actual parameter which we saw below and this is all like new as of three days to me so bear with me a little bit because I hadn't looked at these macros before so let's see the other interesting thing that I'm going to do now is I'm curious about the scene mesh proxy so unreal does have spline mesh components and to render them it has its own method of doing that but we can't use that because it's not instance which means it would run terribly slow and basically ruin everyone's factories so we have to, we have to make sure they're instanced basically and that's what I'm doing
