### Transcript

> so before vacation me and jace went to twitchcon which was amazing, so much fun so much fun seeing meeting people and putting faces to names, we have filmed a bunch of stuff from twitchcon or not actually well so we've filmed a little bit from twitchcon and, we're gonna put something together in a video format or or talk about it on stream later I haven't prepared anything for this week though so maybe maybe next week we'll see it depends I'm in a very busy like you know how like when you get back from work or like from back from vacation and you just like before vacation you're like all right this is not my problem anymore like push it aside all right I'm leaving bye and then when you come back you're like ah god ah no so that was essentially my situation, last week when I got back from vacation again, there's, there's a pile of work that's been sitting for me and that doesn't even account for the the community management side or like well it accounts for the community side but like the stuff that you know has to do with streams and videos, that's not even part of that stuff so, so, hopefully we can we can make do, there's a pretty, pretty busy period, for me, and for us in general I think because there's a lot of stuff happening all right
