> what's your favorite feature in the game right now after playing okay so I've played, recently I've been playing like a couple of old builds to the game and there's a lot of stuff that I miss let me just put it that way that like makes building asinine, like- I played a version of the game where you couldn't sort your inventory for instance I did not realize how annoying that was before we had that, so that was rough, guidelines even though they're not like fully finished they still like work compared to like not having guidelines at all it's like pretty neat, so, but I don't know if there's like one feature that it's hard to like say like this this is the best feature imagine playing without zooping yeah that's kind of also part of it the zooping though I feel I was more used to it before so I don't miss that that too much but- I didn't realize how much I missed this sort function before I played the version without it
