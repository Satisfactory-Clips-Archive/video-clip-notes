> still a hard no on ue5 I don't think we've ever said a hard no we've always we are still investigated actually believe it or not because I think I think we would like it but you have no idea how much work it would mean holy, it would yeah if we were to switch to ue5, we would need to completely change the physics engine like rip it out and replace it we would need to change a lot of how like our our smart like, sort of implementation how we render stuff, we wouldn't be able to I think we I don't know if that's true actually but we wouldn't be able to like excessively use nanite or lumen in any way because they work in a specific way and we need to convert our everything to that, I think our environment could actually do a lot like benefit a lot from from using nanite because we have very detailed cliffs and stuff that we constantly have to laud, so that would be cool but I don't know there's there's so much work that would go into moving the project over with ebf5

> so yeah these are just the things that I come up with the top of my head there's obviously a lot more with the juice I'm guessing physics would help with fluids actually fluid physics wouldn't help with fluids at all because that's our own fluids like fluid the fluid mechanics is our own implementation and we would be using the same one I'm talking physics for like vehicles and like the player and like that that kind of stuff hard truth if you don't update our uf5 your game will be left in the dust I don't think that's the case at all there's a lot of old games that you guys know that rocket league is unreal engine 3 for instance that game is thrived like the the engine version doesn't say much about the game honestly like it's it's, it's more about what you do with it it's not the size that matters it's what you do with it and the low res dust we are actively working on that so like it makes sense if we try to update the engine right people just want the bigger number yeah because it sounds cool it's it will get more but people don't know what they'll get they just know that no but update it'll get more
