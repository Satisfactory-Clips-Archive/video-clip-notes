### Transcript

> grid and you can name them for better organization did you see that by the way the text this yeah yeah yeah oh i saw i saw yeah because you never commented on it no i didn't because i was like i was just you know i was like like angry on the inside you know yeah yo by the way it's running the particle accelerator in the background here and the in the circuit here so the the this is uh if you're really eagle eye you'll you'll notice that why is the curve going upward that's not something that we've talked about before yeah like that's nothing that should happen in the game um i don't think anybody caught that but it's just like a fun little detail even and like we've never explained that actually we've actually we've actually never explained why it goes up like that and and we show it again when we show the particle accelerator but for those of you who don't know the energy that the particle accelerator needs correct if i'm wrong here but i'm pretty sure i'm right uh it it it uh it builds up as it generates stuff and then it drops or something like that yes that's correct it oscillates exactly yeah exactly so it's it's sort of it uses like power dynamically so that's what's happening here and later when we show the particles utter you'll see another example of that power ramping up and then dropping and then ramping up and then dropping again yep
