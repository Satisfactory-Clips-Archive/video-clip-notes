> are there any plans to make it possible to join designers to get it to build larger blueprints at an exponential power cost I don't think so because yeah I don't I don't think that's doesn't make too much sense in that exact way but again like this the feedback here the problem I guess that what you want is to be able to blueprint bigger things right and that's the and you should go to the QA site and let us know

>, Jace tell the community or I'll tell you whatever you want so, you will add bigger blueprint area only if you take away Mass dismantle all right there it is, so you can vote now one or two one is yes two is no, to increasing blueprint area but Mass dismantle is removed yes if you want that one you want that two if you don't want that there's the obligatory 69 420. yeah that's true all right all right I think this is overwhelmingly no is it two there's a fair few ones though yeah okay so in that case I think in that case we will leave it as it is and no golf everybody loses that was the quiet part that was the quiet part to say out loud- I was crossing my fingers when I said it yeah yes I thought you guys would love to have golf but I guess not yeah I disc golf yes that would be better yeah would actually be better we have to remake the update 5 video but it's disc golf instead of golf goal yeah just an entire update is just disc golf I still have my discs we need to play but the season is kind of over yeah I've tried to play in the snow before it doesn't go so well no you can you can tie a little like you know this like, strings you put on packages you know the ones that like curl up you can put that and and tape it underneath the disc so like when it dives into the snow you'll still see the string but it's still like you you still like I've lost a lot because wet hands and stuff yeah yeah yeah well you bring a towel sure yeah I was wearing a towel especially when it's muddy season because then you have to use the towel between every throw because like so much mud everywhere you know
