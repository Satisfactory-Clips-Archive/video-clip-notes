### Transcript

> oh yeah uh been a little while without any updates uh yeah um yeah there's some updates for like localization that's gonna be coming out over some time as well um the next sort of major it's a minor but it's big it's going to be in like november um or end of october one of those two um but then as for that there's no real plans for smaller updates people here are just working on the bigger stuff the bigger rooney yeah so it's a little hard to update the current versions of the game whilst that's happening but yeah we are working on some stuff it's also we're working on kind of both update four and update 5 because one problem we had with update 4 was that we're in we were in a kind of like in maintenance mode once we released all the content for it so a lot of like uh like programmers were working like non-stop fixing you know stuff that we're coming up with there were issues with update three uh whereas like artists that weren't working on like things that needed to be fixed we were like kind of hold held back a bit um so right now we're trying to like phase everything out as much as we can in terms of like uh who is working on what so right now like we're working on d4 but also a little bit on update five so that you know once update four drops will have the pipes are like the ball already rolling for update five um so yeah there's people are just working on on things and that's also partly why we can't like jace just mentioned we can't update as easily with patches right now because we have so many kind of different like branches of the state of the game right now and then at some point we're going to like merge things together and then release it as an update but we're going to need to do that a few times and it's just too messy to do that too often so to speak
