### Transcript

> so what we said about update five so far is that uh we're kind of rolling out update five if you have been checking out our youtube channel we've got like a couple of videos out already about um the new world update that's coming we're doing a revamp of northern forests it's got a lot of more um more trees so if you're built in the lauren forest you can like anticipate trees spawning in your base they won't actually like mess up your factory it'll just like have a bunch of trees growing in i had a factory in northern bay forest because that's like one of my favorite spots um and when i got back from vacay and i booted up my old save file i had like a bunch of trees but it wasn't actually too much work like cleaning it up granted it it's not like a huge uh base that's like spans throughout northern forest um but like it's it's like manageable right and it's just like if we haven't said this before you know every update we try to to minimize the impact that it has on your save files so that you can keep work like playing on your same save file throughout the entire duration of early access and sometimes that's possible sometimes that's a bit harder like if we change recipes and stuff like that um then obviously like your factor lines will quote-unquote break you know but we're really trying to not have it so that like we never want you to like have to feel like you have to restart your say fall that's that's never the intention um but it's it's hard to say that it's hard to be like look into the future you know hindsight is 20 20. so um but but so far at least in my safe all there hasn't been too much issues but i beat it up but famous last words um so sort of what we announced so far is is that northern forest is changing um we're also working on you know in every update we also work on optimization and bug fixes so that's something that's coming in every update essentially
