> oh so so then which brings us to, game modes, so some people ask about peaceful or creative mode or whatever and maybe that's even relevant to the to what I just said before about needing to know what the game is more supposed to be like first or is that not relevant in in some ways yeah I mean we we have been looking at I mean game modes is kind of a broad thing you could make it into really broad thing right because you could have this whole window where you could adjust all these settings of how you want your game specifically to play and that is something that might be a bit extensive but it might totally be worth it but things like peaceful mode and creative mode I don't think they're too hard for us to do and they seem very much worth it because I think a lot of players would just love to build without having to worry about costs in any way and a lot of players do not like the combat because it's just like they don't have the reaction time or that's not the reason that they want to play this and I think we should support those those options because of that yeah and I mean internally we do have cheats that would allow this it's just that they're very crude I think so that's why we haven't done it yet but yeah because we will yeah it is like, one other thing that we've said before as as for why we don't want to do it just yet is that we need to focus feedback on what we want to do like on sorry on on, building the base game for the most part, if we start getting feedback from folks in creative mode who want certain things which is not, relevant to the base game then it's it's going to muddy the waters a little bit is that, do you think that that is a a legit reason or is that not really part of the decision making on that topic so far I lost you there yeah me too man too long did not listen so okay yeah so so is is, my brain so is is muddying the waters one reason we don't want to go into, other, game modes just yet so if we have people in, yeah so okay that made sense could have said it in 10 words

> no I was just not listening that's that was the problem it wasn't that it was too long yeah I just lost my focus for a bit, no, that has been, an argument that has been brought up by someone I don't know who but yeah I mean it would be a problem right because if all these peoples are playing in different ways then we don't really know necessarily what they're referring to when they give us feedback on certain things yeah and even if they say oh no I'm playing in this this mode then we still get a lot of these different directions that we're getting feedback from that might just kind of make it harder for us to address issues yeah, it might not be the biggest problem and we'll have to assess it but yeah it could be an issue I guess I guess to some degree, the like there are people who are making mods for the game you know unofficially I guess to some degree that's also part of it however or that would contribute the same sort of confusion maybe, or money of the waters of our feedback that we get however I also think that folks who go through that effort to get mods kind of just know that when their frustrations around despite using the mods they don't really give that feedback maybe or I'm not sure yeah I think generally the mods just make their lives better but they might have more issues like technical problems coming up right yeah for sure for sure
