### Transcript

> when are we going to start getting more patch fixes I don't know if I don't think we know that right now, because it's probably not going to be until the next update right I blank devil I was reading are we talking about patch fixes and I don't think we have any patch fixes planned until like the next update like in terms of, it probably will be something yeah we've usually is updated the game with localization fixes but like bug fixes stuff like that usually come with like the next, the next bigger update because part of part of the reason for that is because when we are developing the game we have a bunch of different like branches is what we're referring it's like development tracks essentially and when we released this, that last update update seven we have like one development track and if we want to fix a bug that we also intend to release we have to fix the bug on that track and then push it live on that track and then merge from that track into our development track where the rest of the team is going racing down, so it's just like we have to do the fix twice if we want to push it live so it's like if we do a lot of bug fixing then we do a lot of double work so usually we tend to save it and and it's risky as well because if you end up not implementing it yeah in the same way you end up being like this is a one-way thing and then it ends up being like two weeks because they keep running into issues yeah that is a lot of tracking I lost track Toby eye tracker true we need more tracks
