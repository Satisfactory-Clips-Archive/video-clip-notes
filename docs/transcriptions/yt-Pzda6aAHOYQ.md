### Transcript

> yeah but can you talk a little bit about what it was like balancing for pipes because i think that's something that we never really talked much about uh no not really i mean it wasn't that much different honestly than the normal balancing it's just that we use different numbers right because we went for the the cubic meters instead of the just the amount of items so we had to kind of re-envision how we're going to do that but in the end we kind of kept it to the same numbers just time just by just timed it by 10 and it's some fiddling around um some interesting things though and i think a lot of people have noticed is that for example you can't overclock your nuclear power plant currently yeah what's up with that because it requires 300 cubic meters of water per minute and you can only supply that so if you go overclock you go over to 300 so you can never do that and that was actually because we uh we were supposed to have pipes run at 600 and then because of technical complications we dumped it down and then we had two options either we have all the numbers that we had until that point or we just waited until we could fix it and that's kind of what we're doing now so maybe later we will get some either faster pipes or some mk2 pipes or some other solutions we will have to see wow spoilers mark holy that's a pretty big thing to just drop like that cool
