> is it possible to add german layout from the keyboard for the console command no well it I don't know actually there's a workaround for that by the way, all you german peeps with german layout keyboards, if you you can't access the console because you have that german layout the unfortunately the best way right now to to work around that is to install an english keyboard layout to windows and like enable it in the keyboard settings and then you press windows key space and you can swap between the the two settings so you can like swap between english I actually do that with my swedish layout and my english k layout as well and it's it it's just super quick and you just like swap press the tilde key swap back to german and then you have access to the console that's unfortunately that workaround you're gonna have to do with because we don't like officially support the unreal engine console in the game
