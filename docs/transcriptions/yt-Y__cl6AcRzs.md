> yeah just stuff update four I think I still think it's too soon to say update for come on it's update three has been out for yeah at least like four months before we started we need a year before update 10 there's no time for four good options yeah to skip four chase got the same jumper on us last week you bet I'm like bart simpson you gotta keep your branding yep yeah so yeah with the the whole steam thing, yeah still working on it, I suppose I can give somewhat of a guesstimation yeah I'll give I'll give a guesstimation okay keep in mind how awful we are at predicting things okay so when I say a guess, it is hopefully a ballpark you know, so people have some idea, so- I personally will say two to three months, it could be a little less than that it could be way more than that especially with coronavirus and the way that how it's kind of weird working now things might take longer but but it's not like a six month download I think I hope we said let's say, but we feel it's not going to be that but guys like we we really aren't, I'm sorry we really aren't locking ourselves or or, what's the word here sticking committing to a, time frame just yet okay so we're not gonna be freaking out over reaching a specific date just yet but that is around what you guys can expect okay like it's not next week, and it's not gonna be six months yeah and it's yeah it's and it's probably also like an optimistic yes but we're hoping, we're working on specifically we're working on getting steam integration working and cross-play to work yeah because we've we feel like it would not be a good idea to release like even if we could like release the steam exclusive version or whatever right now I don't think we think it's a good idea no, because like we'd be shooting the people that aren't epic that want to play with the people on steam and the people on steam that want to play with people on epic like it'd be unfair to to everyone to not have like some form of cross-play solution on release yeah it would it would really suck, for people having to buy the game again just to play with their friends exactly yeah so and and the other thing about like releasing things too early is that again like every feature like every update releasing things too early is really bad for us, and and by extension bad for you guys when things don't work well for us then everyone loses, you know like if people are waiting so much for, the steam release just like pipes for example like any big thing like that and we release it too soon and it's garbage people are gonna be like well that was a waste of time and then they're just gonna bail and give up and have no faith in us at all so it is important for us to make it good so that, when we when we do put out steam it's, hopefully it meets people's expectations and it works, so that you can all have a good experience from the get-go sans sounds like a plan I think I'm agreeing high five
