### Transcript

> another thing is so we also showed off the stop settings some people saw, stop settings, and some people said like can you can you designate which so the stop settings are are some settings for, when a train stops at a station what should it do how long should it be therefore should it wait till it's, fully finished, loading or unloading, or a specific amount of time or whether or not it should you could specify what items it will load or unload as well and some people have been asking can we specify per cart or anything like that which freight cart, you can't you just do it per train per station and the train will just, load and unload whatever items you specify there so that's it's like a very bare bones logic system for trained, trains specifically they're they're yeah they're per train yeah so you can have two train lines this is sort of what I did with the teaser video I had, one train line pick up fuel and then no wait what did I do yeah I had one train line come in and only drop like one of its, because that train station is an offloading train station like it takes sorry the other way it loads so it takes when a train comes in it takes the stuff from the station right except for the fuel that gets dropped off into the station but there was one train line that didn't I didn't want it to pick up, everything I just wanted to pick up the one that's in the first carriage or frame cart whatever so there's some logic there so like you can have a train that only picks up one if you have like three different things at the train station and you only want like one train car to pick it up but maybe that trend card is used for other things so you want to like reserve the first train card for that yeah and it's possible to do that sort of yeah many stuff
