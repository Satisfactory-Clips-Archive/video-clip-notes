> well the people who bought it on epic get free steam keys I get this a lot, this person says I guess probably not yeah probably not I think I think it's safe for me to say no, you know there's this one element to it where you give epic money and then steam gives you a free game feels weird, but then the other element of it is that a lot of folks, you know they want to play games with their friends and their friends only want to play on steam and they're like but I already have it on epic and you're on steam can we play together as snoop mentioned earlier in the stream yeah we're shooting for cross play so we really don't want you to have to buy the game twice just to play with your friends, so hopefully that will help there
