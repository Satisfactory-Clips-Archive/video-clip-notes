### Transcript

> controller support question mark question mark hopefully maybe I yeah I hopefully like control support something we've always liked push back for 1.0, and, I don't know if when see here's the problem I know that we kind of like said in the beginning of development that like oh control support has definitely happened like no doubt about it it's 100 happening, but as as the game went on and we developed the game like it's becoming like harder and harder to like kind of like mentally like how would control support work with our game with the changes we've made because we didn't anticipate these changes and I guess that's kind of our fault in a way because really when if you want to have control support you have to like kind of have it day one and then you have to design the game around it and I think we just said that like we kind of want to cater towards playstation, playstation why don't I say that, pc ps pc, we want to cater towards pc players first and then if it makes sense to add control support and and you know then we'll do that, I still think we will honestly but, you know nothing's guaranteed at this point
