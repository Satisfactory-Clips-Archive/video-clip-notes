> any ideas how many tears would be at the end of the development, i don't personally know i don't think we've decided fully maybe mark has but he doesn't there's like, yeah there's a a tentative answer i think yeah it may change there's no point in thinking that that's actually set or not, but the the number of tiers isn't like the limit of like how much more content we're gonna add to the game because if at some point we're gonna need to like at some point we're like we're gonna want to add more content but we're still like we're not gonna add more t here so we're gonna like spread it out more in the current tiers, so don't y'all shouldn't feel that like oh just because we won't add more tears just won't mean that there won't be more content to the game that's definitely not the case or buildings or you know stuff like that yeah that was like a sort of a thing that we had to address a lot before update 4 came out is, like more tiers it's like it's not like you need more tiers to add more content yeah or you need to have more tiers to have more complexity or you need to have more tiers to have more you know gamepl are a progression thing that, yeah but you know you can still have it more tiers just mean more space parts or space elevator parts and i don't know how much you guys love making those yeah it's my favorite part of the game 1 000 jet propulsion engine thingamajigs yeah modular yeah i saw i i saw the tier like you know after tier 7 and 8 like the the ones that you put in there, i saw those and i just sort of knocked out and was like forget about that somebody posted on a reddit like before update three i believe where they showcase like here's what it looked like when you unlocked tier vii before, and it was like five super computers like it it was something super lame compared to like yeah 5 000 space poopies or whatever space poopies yeah it's hardcore
