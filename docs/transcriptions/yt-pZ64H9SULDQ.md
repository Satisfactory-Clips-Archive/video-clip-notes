> why isn't gas inside the vehicles i feel like the gas is inside the vehicles because uh there's a bug in the game that's been in the game forever this is an interesting bug because it seems like this is a trivial bug to fix it kind of is but also isn't where you like unequip equipment when you enter vehicles which means if you have a gas mask on you are not protected impervious yeah from from gas so like even if you have it uh which we are going to fix at some point because we feel like we might need to re-implement the the equipment system to fix that bug yeah yeah that's why a lot of people have requests around uh equipment stuff you know can we have uh jetpack and gas masks going at the same time or whatever uh and we see those requests but um yeah we plan on we plan on redoing the whole equipment system at some point in the future so we're thinking we'll just wait till wait till we get to that point rather than put in some weird fix now
