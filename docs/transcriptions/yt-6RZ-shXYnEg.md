> any plans to update the question satisfactory i made a few posts the other week and it doesn't feel overly intuitive like, the, like lots of posts the same not enough taglines, it's possible that we might update the website in the future like thanks for that feedback feel free to add feedback about the website however, the people at the office do see the posts like we have people that check that [ __ ] like every single day so whatever your posts are they do end up getting seen, but i think there i mean i think there are some issues with it i think searching is a little bit hard on the site to be honest, and so when and so if we end up getting like duplicate posts it could be because searching isn't very good, or something like that but, it is something that's probably worth a revisit at the moment it seems to be working well for us but maybe but that doesn't mean we shouldn't improve it but it's all about who's gonna do it and when and the person who made the website doesn't work with us anymore so we'd have to get someone else to come in and do it or someone else from the team to stop what they're doing to work on it yeah
