> come along let's go and have some fun all right there's a train coming everyone my name's Jace I'm the community manager at coffee stain studios and that's right it is that time of the year again it's update number three and in it we're gonna have that's right you've read the title we're gonna have pipes in the game finally you all asked for it and now it's gonna be in there among some other things so snowed and I are going on an adventure to find the the biggest and most extravagant pipe on the entire universe is how this is going to be a huge journey and I hope you enjoy one thing I do want to mention is that we had to go on this adventure back in September and this video is probably coming out in December so we actually don't know everything that's gone into the update but in some case somehow we're gonna make this as clear as possible to you all I don't know how that's gonna happen since we have no idea what's going on so let's go on an adventure

> so we're here in Stockholm we've begun our journey and the goal here is we want to travel around and we want to find the most amazing pipe we've ever seen and we want to see different kinds of pipes along the way we want to see what pipes do what does it mean how long are they how much do pipes wait but of course on the journey we're going to be giving a lot of information about other things that are coming in this update as well so stay tuned and at different locations you'll get more information and we're gonna go to our next location now or I bye
>
> [Music]

> okay so you looking good up there we're here at our first location and a lot of people are still asking us about flying vehicles and drones or something like that and so in the spirit of that snoot and I we're gonna be sleeping in a plane there won't be planes in the game though but what we'll be in are some general updates that we're going to be adding to update number three and so that's gonna include multiplayer fixes more bug fixes UI overhauls rebalancing the game optimizations a lot of different things but before we do that let's just check out this bad boy looking pretty good
>
> [Music]

> so you might actually be wondering where we are right now we're at a place called jumbo stay and it's actually just this big plane near Stockholm Arlanda Airport and you can just stay in it it's like a little hotel and there's a nice room here that you can hang out and drink some beers speaking of which they're pretty nice
>
> [Music]
>
> so you may be wondering where we are right now and it kind of looks like an airport and that's because we're in an airport and that's because we left the other plane that we slept in and we're gonna get on another plane that we're gonna sleep in but it's also gonna be up in the air so now where are we going you may ask and that's gonna be a secret you may be wondering where we're gonna be going and that is a top-secret thing I don't think I'm ever gonna reveal to you we're here in Geneva and the reason we're here is because our sources say that the world's most majestic pipe can be found here so we're gonna follow up on that and see if we can find it but it's also really hot here which is a great segue into the next update that I want to talk about and that is to the June desert you may have felt that the dudn't desert was a little bit lacking here and there and that's because we just haven't finished with it yet so we've done another solid pass on that to make it better we've updated assets we're adding OSI which is apparently the plural for Oasis so those are going to be in there as well some general updates that we're gonna add to the entire world as well that there will be a few of those including just a smarter wind system amongst other things as well so you can look out for those and I don't know what we're doing next so you know let's all see you then you're unhappy alright you're on this here we got a pipe I had a rip you in half if it gets the chance you ought to be careful isn't she a beauty though she's not what we're looking for though so we'll just move on another thing that we've added to update number three is a resource sink and a resource sink is it's kind of like a building and then you put excess resources into it can you crunch it all up and you analyze it you send it up to headquarters and they give you coupons and then what you can do with the coupons is you go to a shop that we've also added into the game and in the shop you can buy other resources as well as foundations and some vehicles and some statues and a lot of really cool things so you can check it out do you think that no no that we shot this at a different time

> so now I know what I'm doing and that's you know our sources have told us go and grab a tram number 18 and they didn't tell us anything else but on the tram it said CERN so I think we're heading towards CERN some of you may know what that place is maybe you don't it's the feature of angels and demons from Dan Brown's book and that is the best source of what CERN is for sure so we'll take this time while we're on this trend to tell you a little bit about another thing and that is dedicated servers now to think about the dedicated services you all voted between whether or not we should prioritize dedicated servers or a month support you did that about three months ago the other thing about three months ago is we're filming this three months ago I have no idea if that a gated service got into when and it's in or if it's coming soon I have no idea what happens so I'm gonna channel future Jace right now through my buddy to see what happened so here it is a status right now is that we're still working on them thank you very much future Jace and I'll see you at our destination Hey look we're at CERN I made it mom specifically to the p1 Atlas location home of the Atlas experiment as well as part of the Large Hadron Collider

> and you know what this bad boy does me neither but it is science and the thing about science is it works you know what doesn't work though your save files officer update number three this update will be breaking the saves because of all the new things that we're adding into the game however you can still use your old saves I've made a video on this before and there'll be a link in that cards up above and in the description below so hopefully that's still going to be okay but again this is all in the spirit of progress so please forgive us for breaking your saves hopefully we don't have to do that again but we kind of have to in this case

> we want to get from point A to point B quicker so do I luckily in satisfactory you don't have to deal with long queues but you do have a big map that you want to travel around in so we've added travel tubes so you can zoom around and and don't have to look anymore cool
>
> [Music]

> so we finally made it so this amazing pipe it's the biggest one in the world it doesn't look that impressive it seems like it's kind of blocked up just like I block up my pipes at home but yes we're adding pipes to the game they're going to be transporting fluids and gases and things like that and also you're going to have to face some challenges when it comes to verticality so it's not going to be super simple to just use it but it's going to provide a new challenge for you all that marks the end of our journey we've seen a lot of cool things and I hope that you really enjoyed the journey part of it and also hearing about what's coming up in the update just remember though this is not all the details about the epic this there's much much more and we have patch notes and I'll link to that down below and there's way more things that have come in this update than what's just been said here so please check out the full patch notes and I hope you all enjoy update number three consider sharing this video so more people find out what's going on with the game and I'll catch next time because the plane is about to leave really tired bye
