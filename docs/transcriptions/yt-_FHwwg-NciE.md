> it is it is a lot of work, sorry dad was on facebook again, so so, like I don't we don't really have like, this is how often we're going to be able to put out updates like we have a rough timeline what we think but, historically we put out like roughly two updates a year ish but that's not to say that we're updates yeah bit major ones but that's not to say that we will always do that in the future like it kind of depends on what we're doing, so like if if for for whatever we're doing next like if it ends up taking more time then I think we would want to take that time because we are like I said before we are thinking long term we are thinking about the 1.0 release like we want to reach that point, so a lot of decision making really is about getting to that point so hopefully that answers your question yeah yeah
