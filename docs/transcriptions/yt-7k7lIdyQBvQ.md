> uh so why can we okay here's a question as well that came up a few times and i got some dms about it actually why can we not put a second person in the buggy so the game used to have the ability to have a passenger in vehicles in all vehicles including the um the little sugar cube and stuff um we removed that at some point i asked mark mark recently why why did we why did we remove it he was like i forget we will never know yeah so i never know for from from his memory he was like i think it's an effort versus value issue there might have been some issues with networking but i think it's something that we'll like we'll look at it again and see if we want to do it but but yeah uh the the actual answer right now is is i forgot that's very own brand that doesn't mean there wasn't a reason it's just we forgot what the reason was okay i love it when um maybe it's not a good reason anymore maybe you know when we revisit it maybe it's a good reason to put it back in but we'll see i love it whenever this happens a lot for me like whenever like we've decided on something or like went through like oh this is a blah blah blah this is how we're gonna do it all right cool we decided now and then like half a year later we go back to like let's do that thing why do we do why didn't we do it this way i don't remember like oh i mean we did this recently when it comes to community management yeah forever right stuff it was like we had some plan and we were like going gung-ho ahead for this plan yeah and then and then we'll just like wait why are we doing this again everyone's like i remember in february we knew why we were doing it we had a really good reason yeah we had a great reason for why we were doing this specific thing and no one knew what it was and we ended up just like double backing on it we're like all right let's just change the plans it's so funny because like you can't really like oh it's what it doesn't it doesn't seem like smart way to do it but i guess we aren't doing but like we should also challenge the fact that we didn't do it this way and like and then you run into like oh this was why and then like you just feel dumb i feel like that happens way too much with me specifically what if you see him i forgot yeah that's true
