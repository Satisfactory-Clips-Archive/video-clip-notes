### Transcript

> I definitely want to get into highways or roads and stuff like that but- I've just been like so much work but now with blueprints now with blueprints yeah yeah yes I wonder if we'll ever add roads functionality effect because we did have it we actually did have it a very long time ago I don't know if you were even with us and when we had we had a version of the game where we did have roads and stuff like that that's the version that Simon finished the game but it was like yeah kind of buggy and broken and yeah yeah yeah so, obviously if we had roads that would be sick but you know we don't know if we can make it happen or not because it's one thing to have to have roads in the game so that technically one can build a road it's another story to make sure that the ux behind it all is all solid and that people actually enjoy it because if we put something in that like works like, people will be upset it doesn't even matter if you technically have the feature or not, we need to solve all that stuff too and sometimes solving all that stuff is really hard and we need to consider well what do we prioritize do we add roads or do we do other things so so we'll have to say we'll have to see it's obviously a good idea I'm sure no one is opposed to having roads in the game it's just it's just a matter of how hard is it, what issues are going to come up and at what cost do we focus on roads over other things indeed
