> you guys already have plans or thought to go to xbox and ps next-gen consoles, I mean we a lot of people have been requesting it like over the years and so like we've definitely given it thought, I think we've done a little bit more than thoughts as well I think we have sort of like in done a little bit of investigation for some stuff, so like it probably comes to you know as no surprise that we would look into it and we have looked into it a bit but we don't really you know much like when we were talking about unreal engine 5 like we can look into it but what we've it depends on what we find right so there's there's been some investigation into that area of things but there's not really like there's nothing really to report yeah right now but it's it's it's something that we see that a lot of people have requested we can obviously see that it would be good to have if we could just you know snap our fingers and and release it on console like probably could I you know should I guess but that's not the situation unfortunately
