> is there anything you really wanted to add during development but it turned out to be too complex unfeasible i think are there are there a lot of things that turned out to be too complex defined complex because like there's definitely been did it just not work out like what did it end up not really being a good idea yeah that happens a lot yeah things that are i can i can think of a couple things that we kind of wanted to do but it turned out to be just like i i wouldn't say like too complex but rather too much work to to make it kind of function the way we kind of think is valuable sort of

> some and there's there's a couple of like solutions technical solutions that we try to do that aren't necessarily features but like avenues we try to pursue that just turn out to be like too complicated uh like not really worth the effort um yeah for what they save um yeah that's kind of what happens more often than than not because like if if there's a feature that we want to have in the game and that we like is gonna end up bringing a lot of value to the game we can usually find some way to solve it like maybe it won't be we weren't going to put it in the way that we wanted it to but we can find some other way to implement it i think it's sort of rare for us to not be able to figure it out but there are some things that are just like once you sort of investigate it you're like okay the effort isn't worth it or when you investigate it you realize actually this just isn't worth it yeah um actually i can think of an example the we talked about this last week the like having visualization of the fluid movement in pipes was one thing that we talked about early on that would be too like resource heavy on the game and that was something that you know would help with like understanding pipes but it's like we it's too much effort to implement that and make it run efficiently enough and that's sort of why we made the the pipeline indicators instead because they sort of serve the same purpose um but they're like much cheaper to implement or whatever yeah rephrase it um some so maybe some like there's there's a couple of things like that i guess uh where same thing with the hypertube hypertube we wanted to have it more like physics based in the beginning um and now it's more like you're just like moving along with the spline of the pipe instead it's just like an animation yeah it's it's kind of it's just lurping and like there's physics in terms of like speed but there's no like originally we wanted to have like so you can like bounce around in the pipe and so you'd be ragdolling in the pipe and just like going through it that was the original idea for the hypertube
