> right here, now that you guys have a big boy obviously are you planning on hiring, a lot more people to fill it out actually I think we just stopped hiring yeah, and so we got some extra people- I the plan is not to fill it out, if you grow it like growing a dev studio the bigger it gets the harder it is to do anything so you kind of want to get you need to find a really good balance between the number of people you have and what you're outputting and so so like just filling it out because we have the space and I suppose we probably may I don't know mate let's just say hypothetically we had the money for it as well is not automatically a good thing to do so, yeah but at this at this point point I don't really know what the plan is but from what I understand we're kind of done hiring for a little while yeah as far as I know too I think we, the feeling I'll this is my take on it but it feels like coffee also has like more like a long-term thinking so we don't even if we could have like 60 people right now we wouldn't do it because it wouldn't make sense for us yeah
