### Transcript

> oh boy but yeah this is mark mark is our game director mark decides stuff that's related to the game lots of stuff he's the one who's like let's let's change the overclocking into linear and then be like no let's not do that actually yeah, so that's that's one thing I thought we'd talk a little bit about, first because we initially revealed when we revealed update 6 we said that we were thinking of changing overclocking to be linear and, then last second kind of not really but it kind of it kind of was last second yeah I mean we actually changed it last second it even is changed it even is more last second because it is possible that like the initial build that goes live might have it, I think it is fixed now okay okay but, I'm not sure anymore at this point yeah it's going back and forth so so what was the main reason why we decided not to, it's mostly because we got a lot of feedback and that also prompted more discussion internally which made me kind of think that we should look at it a bit more closely right so because the change from exponential to linear is very simple yeah it's a very simple change that's why we actually wanted to just try it because it's such an easy thing for us to just do yeah, but then with all the feedback feedback that we got and discussions that are prompted internally people had like different ideas of it I started thinking that we could maybe do more with it like something more complex and that turns the cinema system into something better than just exponential or linear there are also some suggestions that kind of prompted that where maybe there could be something where you, don't even need slugs to overclock but the slugs make the exponential graph like as harsh for example or you can get upgrades in a map to make the exponential less less harsh over time it should progress and I kind of want to investigate those things and see what the best possible system is that we can make that kind of fits both the two player groups that are now in favor and against the change yeah so because I think we can find this midway that kind of works for everyone where everyone kind of gets out of it what they want and also in a way that we think it's good for the game but it will take some more time to investigate and we didn't have that time with this update because we had so many other things that we needed to pay attention to so I didn't want to just rush in and just do a change for the sake of it yeah we barely managed to
