### Transcript

> meat and potatoes of this video is actually changes to some some people want vehicles to maybe be quicker or more powerful or something here and there we haven't made any changes to the vehicle's tuning or anything like that yet but we've made a ton of changes to the automation system with the vehicles and uh specifically to make them more reliable as extensions of your factory essentially so let's go through those changes one by one so first issue that some people had was that you know you would spend your time recording a path and the vehicle then would not actually follow that path exactly and sometimes get stuck it might fall off a cliff or run into some trees or some bushes or something like that and just get stuck there because it didn't follow the path that you specifically recorded so we've made some changes to the way that vehicles now follow waypoints so that they're now more true to your recorded path they're not exact they're not 100 exact but they're much much more accurate uh to the puff that you recorded as the player previously the way that the vehicles worked is they they kind of didn't take future waypoints into it into consideration they just looked at their next waypoint they drove at it once they hit it they then looked at the next waypoint and just drove straight at that now we're using these things called splines to smoothly connect the wave points and what a spline is is it's essentially a line that smoothly connects points together and so you can see here in this sort of like little little behind-the-scenes little look here uh there's the purple line which is the spline connecting the waypoints and there's a purple box which is the vehicle's target essentially the ideal target for the vehicle the vehicle is just following that purple box along the spline so like i said this won't mean that the recordings will be 100 accurate to what you recorded as a player but it will be much much more uh accurate and much more reliable now even though it's
