> i like the game but it's i don't like the fact that i don't know update come with all the changes you need to do your base, i mean yeah we we don't like that either but it's kind of the that's sort of the way we have to do it when we're in early access because we're still working on the game and the game is not done the game is like technically in alpha still, so, i mean yeah we try to like mitigate that as much as we can and like not have people have to like start over constantly whenever we do these updates we do a lot of things to so so that folks don't have to do too much yeah, when we do updates but, ultimately the goal is to get the game to 1.0, and so we might have to make some kind of like sacrifices in terms of convenience and stuff like that, to get there right we need to make sure we can actually get there and that the game's gonna end up being good and sometimes old stuff just ain't compatible with the new stuff unfortunately
