> damn it updates plans to be bigger or smaller in the future I think, updates are kind of like what they are yeah or like they become sort of what what they need to be because based on like what we need to implement update 5 was originally supposed to be a much smaller update, but then once we started digging into like a lot of the quality of life things or build system reworks that we wanted to do we started to notice that there's a lot of ideas that we had yeah and it kind of grew and then we also we also noticed that like a few things in planning didn't make sense from them to like be delayed or wait or pushed or whatever so like for instance signaling system was something that we were originally gonna do for update six, and then we moved that into update five because it didn't make sense to have it so far back, so it really is like the things that really decide what's coming in updates is really like what we need to work on next in terms of like what are dependencies, what we want to do also a little bit like what do we think is a cool thing to do next, and yeah planning like a lot of planning like what makes sense to do when yeah, for everybody involved because like it's one thing if like if for updates update five we had a lot of like programming time like but then what are the other people in the studio going to do like they also have to like you know it has to make sense for them to be working on something as well so yeah we also need to include something like the five that makes sense for them you know so like it's a big balancing act for our producers to figure that [ __ ] out yeah but like it's it's it's actually been like kind of a tough thing because we've always had since update three this like is chip on your shoulder is that is that the right saying here I'm not sure but like yeah I never I can never get that yeah yeah well anyway it's like this thing where every update we do we compare it to update three and that's not really yeah that's really not good for us and I think ultimately is not gonna end up being good for you guys because what happened with update three and the introduction of pipes that's like an outlier we can't just we can't just create that situation again you know like the game can only change so much, you can't really force memes that much you know like and so we need to sort of exclude it and so like you know we were kind of worried with update five because like you know we weren't adding new things we're like well maybe we need to add things into update five like new, production buildings for it to be justified as an update otherwise people get upset but like we sort of came to the conclusion that like we that's not the right attitude or mindset to have when adding new things to the game because then you start adding [ __ ] for no reason we just need to look at this update and go what what makes this good what makes sense here and then we'll and that's just going to be what it is and people will like it or not like it so far it really seems like a lot of people appreciate the changes that are coming in update five but like it is really important that update six when when that comes around or whatever the next update is when that comes around it really is whatever makes sense for that update if that means it's big cool if it's small that's got to be okay as well yeah and there's also like the the aspect of you know our player base is very diverse too in terms of like what people are interested in with the game so yeah like you mentioned before we were kind of like oh just doing quite a life update might not be very marketable like or how will our community like care about that stuff when in fact there's a huge like player base that are like really care about I've been dying for this change yeah because I've seen comments where like I'm more hyped for update 5 than update 4 and that's surprising given how like our early discussions before we started like pushing and unveiling stuff for upd5 because we were really worried that like how we're going to like market this because it's going to be just like yeah we need we need to make sure we don't worry about that [ __ ] because like that that just muddies the waters and like that's just a recipe for for bad decision-making yeah in my opinion, so it's yeah it really seems like we're we're we're good at what we're doing we listen to you guys you guys are good at giving feedback, yeah and and we just need to sort of trust ourselves it's it's a good lesson it really is dude yeah to trust, what we're doing yep not worried too much about like but will it be like the pipes revealed though yeah yeah I mean that always comes up but we we have gotten to the point now with especially with update five we've literally had conversations internally where we're like that's that's like the voldemort now no one yeah we will never aim to do another update three pipes reveal like that's that's not a goal that didn't happen that was a fluke it was an accident that was like winning the lottery you don't count on that you know we just we just look ahead and and and just you know do what feels good
