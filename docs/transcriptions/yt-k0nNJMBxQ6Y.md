> what is your actual opinion on Power Rangers I don't know if I have an opinion on Power Rangers I watched, I legit had a period where I tried to watch every single episode of the Power Rangers as like a joke and I couldn't get through the first season, the first season of Power Rangers is like I'm not kidding it's like 120 episodes or something like that let me check it's it's it's a weirdly high amount of episodes Power Rangers season one, there's 30 seasons of Power Rangers by the way, first season has too many episodes too many all right too slow so yeah that's my take on it I couldn't get through the first season pretty much every episode was the same but they're doing they're doing cool jumps and yeah the first season had 68 episodes right same
