### Transcript

> Will the game be localized into other languages? We plan on using community-driven translations
so that, you know, you guys can just help out with any translations
that we want into any language. But we will not have it at the very beginning, We're really hoping to add it into the Alpha,
at one of those stages because we know that we have a lot of different communities in non-english speaking locations in the world, so we would like to provide the game
in their language. We actually planned to have it in the Alpha
from the beginning but Simon happened I guess, and that's all the time we have today.
So thank you very... REALEASE DATE!!
