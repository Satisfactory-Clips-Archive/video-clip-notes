### Transcript

> um some i saw someone before ask if we're gonna have uh two meter walls because if if you go back a little bit in the video uh yeah wall pieces in here yeah just play from here i think i'm yeah i think the diagonal yeah yeah yeah then i go to this orange wall here and when i use the quick switch which we haven't talked about yet but when i use quick switch i go between one meters and the full four meters uh there will actually also be a two meter wall piece so like like as i said this stuff is still in work in progress and there are things that are missing and there are also some things that are probably in the menu that probably won't even be in the game as well so like you know like the state of things is not final that you've seen but it's a pretty good indication so yeah there will be two meter walls as well
