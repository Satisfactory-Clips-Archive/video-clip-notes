### Transcript

> um another cool thing is so with the teaser uh trailer so if i just bring that back and i'll just play it again um with with it uh it is actually it was crafted to be so that if you watch it carefully you can actually start piecing together how all of this stuff works yes it was done intentionally so that people could figure it out uh and that was kind of a goal and a lot of people did write snit yes a lot of people did like obviously people don't know the names of all the parts that we've uh come up with um but people have pretty much figured out the whole chain uh i saw some people posted like a diagram on our discord and i was like yeah that's pretty much pretty much it apart from that like little secret thing in the middle uh where you know you see some input going you don't think we're going on but that's that yeah it's pretty much pretty much all solid yeah and i'm also i also have a funny quote that i want to read out who who was it that said that but uh that whole like manufacturing production line whatever uh for that stuff is uh mark said like yeah it's one of the dumbest ever it's pretty finicky to set up it's like if you're used to the super computer production line it's not like that insane if you're like setting up for great from scratch but it is a pretty big production line okay um but it's a lot of fun to set it up i've been saying it setting it up so many times now for the trailer stuff uh and i am sick and tired of our game but it is pretty cool yep
