### Transcript

> uh i saw a question about if it's possible to do control like undo function uh it is it is it is possible but very unlikely because the amount of work we need to put in to have that in place uh i think i'm just thinking because every undo functionality is really confusingly difficult to implement yeah uh unless you do it from the get-go it would be nice because sometimes i do stuff but i'm like i don't want to do that and then i have to like redo a lot of steps and it's annoying yeah so it is a good feature but chuck it on the qris item maybe yeah i think under undo makes a lot of sense just from a ux perspective can be done right yeah it makes a lot of sense
