> let me also publicly say that if you're doing the thing where, you're moving you're placing like nuclear stuff on trucks and you're driving them off cliffs to get rid of of nuclear waste you are absolutely borking your computer if you do that because the trucks like fall down a clip plane and then they won't get destroyed so they will be in memory all the time and they will keep chugging and trying to move and the more trucks you do that with the slower your game is gonna get so, just bear in mind if you think the game runs slow and you know that you've done that you know that you've like had, trucks and tractors like fall through like holes in the ground it might be because of that and, you might want to like use to say better to like move them and delete them yeah you cannot delete, nuclear waste in the save editor though so tough luck I give my waste to nuclear doggos oh that's how you do it may I ask a question regarding deeprock galactive I have no idea about anything with the protocol active so I probably won't be able to answer that I don't even know what's deep rock collective never heard of it are they falling forever yes they're falling forever kind of, they they get stuck in like it's it's some bug with, the kill plane and- I'm I don't know why we haven't fixed that maybe it's because we want to give like a big finger to all the people that like trying to get rid of nuclear waste or something we should add it so like if the trucks don't contain nuclear waste then, then we we destroy them or something I don't know I don't know what's the situation there but it's it's like it's something to do with like they're so far off that they can't be detected by like the the streaming thing, don't fake let them suffer I think that's that's what we that's what we plan to do, so like it's yeah it's some weird issue with the streaming level stuff
