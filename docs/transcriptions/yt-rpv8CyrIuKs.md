> any challenge or enemies or something that gives us a target or goal so right now the goal is generally for people to I guess to sort of upgrade, to research stuff and you know send off their shipments in the space elevator, it can you know at the moment it can be kind of pointless in a way there's not really much apart from your own interest from doing that but, the goal right now is that we will be adding story into the game and so that will be kind of like another incentive to, push on, in the game, to to learn more about what's going on and, there will be an end of game so you'll be able to finish the game as well finish the story so that's gonna be something too there will be credits I mean there are credits in the game already but yeah credits will roll or something I don't know exactly how it will work
