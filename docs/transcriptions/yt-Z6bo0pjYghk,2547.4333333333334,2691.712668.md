> next of us from from eight points in blue, who's been having, you know so some vehicle situations so so they when they posted this they asked like if this is this rule one in rocket league you know for those who don't play rocket league in rule one there are two very important roles in rocket league the first rule of rock league is you you always keep it up like at the end of a match, it doesn't end until the ball hits the ground so the first rule of rocket league is that you have to keep it up like no matter if you're winning or losing like you have to try and keep it up and score right but the first rule of rock league which is not the same thing as the first row regularly rule one is if you interlock like you start kissing with the vehicles you cannot break off like oh my god yes exactly you just need to keep going yeah so so they asked like is this breaking rule one if I keep it going I've broken rule one once and never again because once I broke it the the other team scored immediately it was weird yeah you do get it actually just happened immediately it's so funny when people get into rule one and then the opposing team breaks off and everyone's just like what the you just do and they just like score on goal immediately mass reported yeah exactly, this also reminds me of I've been for some reason I've just I've fell down this like virtual, rabbit hole the the trackmania streamer yeah right and he puts like a lot of really good videos on youtube as well and so like I've been watching a lot of track media videos and they've got a thing called like I think it's like nosebug or something so when you land nose down you pick up a lot of speed or something like that so that's what that reminded me of me really and now I just want to play track menu and it's not impossible that you can do sort of the same deal in satisfactory where like you gain like a bun like it bumps off or something with the physics or something like that I don't know there's some fun fun ways to cheat the the system in our game when it comes to physics and the vehicles but I don't think this breaks rule one because there's no no other vehicle there is the planet also hurtling through space oh yeah this massage there are things on it as it moves around okay moves around space I would say it's a vehicle all right I would say earth is one big clown car
