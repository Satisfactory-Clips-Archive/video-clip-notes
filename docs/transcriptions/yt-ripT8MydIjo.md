> why can't we have custom ratio splitters you could if we made them that that's something that yeah that's definitely something we could do it's something that i personally would like but but it's also a matter of like it depends on whether or not we ultimately want to have it like you know a lot of suggestions sound good in a vacuum but when you uh put it within the context of the the game as a whole as a player experience what kind of experience you're supposed to give people and whatnot uh some suggestions kind of just throw that balance out of whack and i'm not saying that that's necessarily the case in this case but but if we didn't have one it wouldn't i don't think it would be for a technical reason it would probably be because uh designers or director or whatever would deem it to be something that like is maybe 20 uh you know maybe it cut it it will just make it so that people only ever make them i don't know i i don't make those sort of calls but that would be why you wouldn't be able to have it if we didn't put it in that's my guess i feel like that's that's a lot of truth was spoken truth
