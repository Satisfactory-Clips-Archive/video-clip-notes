### Transcript

> I should answer, somebody asked like if if if just dedicated servers will for sure like improve all performance for everyone, for all clients and the answer to that is like it's it's complex because like in the long run yes because right now the way it's set up is like the one who's hosting has to like load the whole world and like render everything and like you're still running the same logic as you would on dedicated servers but you also have to like be able to serve like the local player so that's really expensive especially on rendering wise so like on dedicated servers obviously the server don't need to do that, the one issue that might happen or will probably happen is that that also means that it can only get as good as it gets on client, so and what I mean by that is that if there are like like with vehicles like there's there's a bit of prediction issues that we're not doing with vehicles like that will obviously happen for everyone, and there might be like depending on where the server is it also you might get like a little bit more latency, yeah yeah exactly so basically with dedicated service you're also going to be a client yeah so yeah exactly like what he's saying is at the moment there's a host and a client and client we've got feedback from people that it sucks playing on clients sometimes, often if the factory is quite big or whatever, but yeah in this case everyone is playing this client yeah however the performance on the server should be better than on a pc for sure so which you should have a better experience as a client yeah assuming our code is good yeah yeah just to make the client function correctly that's the caveat because like there are a few because there might we might also come to the the like once dedicated servers like work and we can put them on a server and blah blah blah there might be things where like in the game we realize like you kind of need to fix this client issue before we can actually release dedicated servers because like it's not going to be playable for real otherwise so like right now there are issues where like some clients can't see inventory obviously those things need to be fixed otherwise you can't play the game underneath so like we need to fix those like game breaking things that right now there are like circumvent like you can circumvent it when you're playing right now like host can fix a lot of stuff, but if we implement when we implement dedicated servers we need to actually fix those yeah those small things indeed indeed yes
