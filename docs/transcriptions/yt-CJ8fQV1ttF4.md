### Transcript

> i've built coal uh power plants on new world and since the goblin coal like never seen before have you enough nerf coal power plants no but we did make that change to power where uh it the generators and stuff like that all uh run at 100 and that's probably what it is because that's what i noticed as well with my power plants um yeah so like even if you're not using all the power uh your generators are gonna just keep chewing up all the coals so build power storage and store some of that power power storage and and like look through your chain and and do a double round of your calculations to make sure that like you will actually meet the the needs for the coal generators um because we felt that before before we had this it was kind of hard to like a lot of cases where people were building coal generators and suddenly they would run out of power when the cold drainers needed to generate that much power and people like the game didn't make it clear to you that like oh this current setup is not going to function if you run into more power usage so now it's like th that change is partly because of that because we wanted to make it more clear when you're building them so you like are realizing sooner that like maybe your your current chain doesn't work with the the if the kohljaner is running 100.
