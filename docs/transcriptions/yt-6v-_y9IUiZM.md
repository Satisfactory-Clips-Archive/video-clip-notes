### Transcript

> so the first question or first comment was some folks said well path signals seem like they're really good they were like wow they're amazing why use block signals at all just use power signals everywhere uh why can't we can we just do that you it's because these path signals won't uh segment off your train lines yes pass signals don't divide your train lines up into blocks they don't create blocks another common word for these are chain signals like these these like um topics or whatever when it comes to signaling systems like it's not that we invented anything like that this is like based on real world uh you know real life real life uses signals for trains right uh and they have like many different names another name for this is chain signals and yeah they chain each other so yeah like just just said you can't segment off train lines if you just use path signals because if you have like a loop or something and you only use path signals then they will always be red because you can never exit that yeah you'll be in just yeah it's it'll essentially just be one big block and you'll have like a path through that entire block leading into itself again yeah so um you do need you do need your block signals because you need to uh you need to mark when a path should end when um a train can exit their signal yeah section yeah
