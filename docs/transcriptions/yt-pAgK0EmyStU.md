> can we get trains that are built only on one side of the rail and not on both so we can have two rails always side by side, I don't think so unfortunately, you can always open the qa side but we're pretty happy with the way the train station works right now in in in a few ways maybe they're not the best solution, but we're pretty happy with the implementation of them right now
