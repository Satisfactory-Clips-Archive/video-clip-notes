### Transcript

> kind of sweet actually I also want to mention and that I think I said in the last video that we were planning on releasing a couple of more updates to creatures in Update 7, spoke too soon because yeah that will likely not happen it will probably happen later down the line, it's partly because there were some dependencies or something in the work that goes into the world changes I mentioned previously, so we'll see when those creature changes make it in there'll also be a couple of bug fixes
