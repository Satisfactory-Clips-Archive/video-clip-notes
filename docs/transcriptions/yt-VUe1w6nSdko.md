> any plans for elevators we just added ladders you're basically asking me ladders mark ii the meme continues realistically though I mean first of all elevators would look really cool I think ladders would function better than elevators, unless you're trying to lift up vehicles but elevators are tricky and but ladders are quick as well like in video games you climb very quickly and you move very quickly in video games so you would climb quicker than an elevator honestly that's what I think unless the problem like I guess like vehicle lifts or something also that I've seen that's kind of missing because there's no way we just need to add so that vehicles can climb ladders I think that will solve most problems yeah no what the you used to jump pads for that now yep there you are just to chunk put that chunky vehicle boy on a jump pad and just blast it up there easy peasy easy peasy
