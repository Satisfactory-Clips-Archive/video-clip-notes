> So, let's move on to the Truck. The truck is super nice, I think. It's a big vehicle. It's much faster than the Tractor. Uh, it's much more reliable with these big wheels, and nice suspension. It feels really heavy. It's got a bigger storage size than the tractor does. So let's just take it for a little spin. Let's fit this here. You can see it feels really heavy. I think it's really nice. So like, there's some rough terrain over here, that we can, there's like a little bump in the level over here. You can see that little ditch. Let's hit that. So, you know, it handles those things quite nicely. So as you can see here, the turning circle is pretty tight, which is super nice, and one of the things that helps with that, is the the rear wheels' counter steer to the front wheels. Super nice. Another feature that I haven't mentioned yet, is we actually have drifting in this game. Now, the Tractor can't drift at all, but the truck can. Just a little bit, and it's mostly just for handling just so, you know, you can do what you want, to get where you want easily. That the truck can function the way you want it to, so here's the normal turn, and then I'll activate drift. You'll see that it tightens quite a lot, and I hit that spike there. So, you can also get some like, pretty cool drifts in the truck, but it's it's all pretty slight. So, let's see if we can do it. Very good, there's a nice little drift there. Yeah, the truck is pretty powerful. They can go up pretty tough terrain like this. Yeah, it's a nice vehicle. Very reliable. And of course it can be automated as well. Let's not hit the Tractor here. Okay, so let's move on to the Explorer. And a little better as well.
