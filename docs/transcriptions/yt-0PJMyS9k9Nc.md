> uh would you more uh would you mind defining train signaling and train collision that everyone keeps asking for uh okay well so train collision would mean you know if trains colliding with each other right so something would happen if your trains collide um so right now trains don't collide you can have like a thousand trains on one rail if you want and they're all like clipping into each other and doing whatever uh but we would be adding train collisions so that that's not really possible um and in order to mitigate that we would then add train signaling and what shine signaling would be doing would be like leaving signals on the train tracks in order so that uh you know to stop trains and and let other trains through kind of things so basically how traffic lights work at at an intersection uh they let one flow of traffic come through once that's done they'll let other traffic go through and that's kind of what the solution will be going for so that would mean if we added that there would have to be a lot more kind of like thinking and planning with your trains um yeah so they might be a little bit more difficult to set up you know if you have more complicated setups and then you would have to learn how to use signaling etc to make sure that it works that it all works so that your trains don't collide but as for some people saying like does it mean it won't trade uh collide with environment rails walls foundations i don't i don't know currently what the plan is in terms of train collision with environment and stuff like that i don't actually know uh but when when all i know is that when we've talked about train collision we mean train on drain collision
