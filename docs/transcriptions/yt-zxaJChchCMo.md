> but it's really good, so let's talk about, last week maybe, so something happened last week, december started and yay and we released our fixmas update which i have to say turned into a way bigger update than i think most of the people at coffistein thought it was going to be, the what's like so we had this last year we kind of wanted to do a christmas update but we didn't have time because we're working on update three and we're working on the scene release and all that jazz, and we've had in the past like in in the friends and family builds before even before alpha pre-alpha, we used to have a small like little christmas event in the game where like a christmas tree would show up instead of certain trees in the game and they were like random presents would like spawn in the world, and that was it that was like a small little thing and we didn't do that for the actual game when we released it and then this year in like july i think, we were like all right should we do a christmas thing let's do a christmas thing so anyone who wants to work on a christmas thing you're free to do it on your, on your, , creative time if you feel like and then we'll do it more as time progresses and people did a lot of stuff so what you're seeing is really like a love of labor of, all the things starting the christmas but right now are all love rather yeah what did i say the love of labor that's the office yeah yeah that's sweats shops, yeah, there's just stuff that people wanted to add to the game there's like no real direction to it people just added stuff here and there and put it together wait what

> by the ussr like yeah so it's a little bit weird to start working on christmas stuff in july or like that was right after vacation maybe august, but, got a lot of stuff done and, like the week before last week when we were putting together all the like stuff all the prep work that we do when we're releasing a build it just like came out of nowhere people like well this is so much bigger than we thought we need to make so many assets for the the store and like yeah i just turned it to bigger build than we thought but i'm glad y'all are liking it, and i'm glad, so many we're gonna see in the community highlights i'm glad so many people have built so many cool things there was a really big uptick of, screenshots on the reddit at least, from the last week so looking for like looking forward to that, yeah we're at least a fixed most built there are a few things we mentioned i mentioned it briefly last week but there are a few questions that people were having, that i've tried to answer as much as i can on our steam forums and our discord and on reddit, but yeah the christmas event the fixmas event rather sorry we'll run from from december 1st to january 18th, next year so it will be a bit longer, holiday event than i think most games do, but we felt like it was important to do it because there's for the people that don't have time maybe to play during the holidays or like this there's so much in it so we don't want to want people to miss out on it and, once the event is over the stuff that you've built in the game will still persist so if you build any christmas trees they will still be there but you will not be able to build any new buildings that are fixmas related so and the same goes for recipes so you won't be able to like produce the ornaments or stuff like that anymore, and if you're curious like exactly how that will work you can even preview that right now if you have a save file where you have built fixmas stuff and you go into the main menu and you disabled it and go back and load your save file that is essentially what the what will happen to your save file once the event is over, and and yeah speaking of like yes you can disable the event if you don't like it if you haven't tried it yet, you can go to the main menu and you can just like a little tick box, a check box under, gameplay options in the main menu and then you can disable it if you would like but why would you why would you want to do that i would spoil the the festivities you know you don't you don't like fun yeah you don't like fun is that like fun actually the best reason i've seen is, there's a few people that so we have like an admin calendar running in in the in the game where like one every day you'll get an item, you'll get a a random item some days some days it's fixed, and, some people were like i'm gonna save it all until all the stuff in the admin keller has been released and not played until then so some people disable the event and then wait until like the advent calendar is over and then they'll play it, which makes sense y'all don't have phones y'all don't like christmas y'all don't like christmas, someone asked if we're gonna if it's gonna come back next year, very likely very likely it will, i don't know well we don't know like like will these specific things come back next year no idea yes will we do something next year if we have time right then sure and i you know it makes sense to bring back the things that you guys unlocked this year right so yeah we'll see we'll see what ideas we'll come up with, this year literally not even over yet so we'll yeah anything can happen we should delay the christmas event actually i know we released that at all but we should delay it just because we got to be on brand right yeah no i got i just got just caught up by a a little conversation in chat i'm not going to oh you're talking to your dad on facebook all right i see what it says on facebook yeah yeah yeah yeah sorry he was just time to go for a while, and yeah i could see some hanukkah stuff that would be cool like a mix of everything yeah but i'm pretty sure like at least it will be the stuff that's in the build currently next year, if we'll add more stuff or tweak something we don't know but i think you'll be able to play this event again in the future yeah tune up here in the spirit of cyberpunk did like christmas until may how about we do updates then let's do it yeah we can do that
