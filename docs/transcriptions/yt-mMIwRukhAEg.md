> update Unreal Engine in 5 planned, there has been quite a bit of work, going to investigating up, on Legend 5., actually so and you know initially that investigation was just investigation at this point it's kind of like hey it actually this might actually be a thing so but we're not really we're not committing to anything I'm certainly not committing anything publicly I'm not telling you that we're doing it or not doing it but, yeah I mean just stay tuned and eventually we'll we'll give you more information regarding that but the thing to remember is to manage expectations here that when you change from like 100 Ford on religion five you don't immediately get all the bells and whistles that are shown to you in the tech demos that doesn't just you just automatically get that so even if we if we change the Unreal Engine 5 we'd probably only ever do it if we're gonna gain something from it all right otherwise it's a waste of time but we don't necessarily need to gain everything that you've seen for it to be worthwhile so
