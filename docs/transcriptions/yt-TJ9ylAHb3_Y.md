> will the store be good hope so that's the plan the plan is for it to be really good uh i know i know the basic you know story i i knew what it was before and then it's changed a bit over time but i have a the basic understanding what the story is and it sounds pretty sounds pretty good i'm all for it if i had any issues with it i'd talk to hannah he was on here she's also the writer uh i'd be like hannah i don't know about this but i i haven't felt the need to do that note that that matters not that means too much like i'm not a game writer um so you know my approval doesn't mean too much necessarily but it sounds sounds fun to me sounds enjoyable to me
