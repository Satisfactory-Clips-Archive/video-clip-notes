> why is power why is power pole considered hard clearance and that's because it's something with functionality so yeah uh things that basically impacts the game i i i guess it's it's a weird sort of you know distinction but um so essentially you can't really build a bunch of power poles on top of each other or something like that and maybe you wouldn't really do it you actually can can you actually do that i think there's well there's a way there's so if there's a will there's a way but yeah i'm sure yeah yeah yeah but that that's kind of why so like power poles along with other buildings that have some functionality with the exception of pipes and conveyor belts um will now have hard clearance yeah because the the footprint that buildings have is part of the gameplay and part of the challenge as well you know so that's kind of why we we sort of yeah and yeah like you mentioned is the schematic cosmetic buildings and the conveyor belts pipes have that soft clearance
