here guys are suggestions- &quot;can we have this?&quot; Jace: &quot;can I have that?&quot; or whatever- the best thing
to do, uhh, like we can pick some of them Jace: and answer them, but the best thing is to
do like go to the suggestions site - the questions site. Jace: Uhm, because, like the majority of the
ones we're reading out here are either suggestions Jace: like &quot;can we have this?&quot; umm, and there not

> Jace: so that's why, umm, just be sure to go
to the questions site too.
>
> Jace: Please use that site.

> Snutt: *nods in agreement*
Jace: It's really useful for us.
>
> Snutt: It's good shit.
