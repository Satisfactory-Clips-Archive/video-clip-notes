> summer sloops anything to do with them one day at some point you can dream just to get messages from some people every now and then who are upset that that we have samoa in the game but you can't do anything with it okay well they'll we'll do something with it soon don't worry maybe not soon but you will imagine at the future we just decided like nah let's get rid of it yeah i take it out i mean that was a mistake i mean that's not impossible like it's us so i wouldn't be surprised if that actually happens yeah it could absolutely happen yeah but that would feel like a such a anti-climax if we did that yeah we've had it in the game for so long i mean we have plans for it and we do intend on using doing it but like at the same time i think we should always reserve the right to like if something doesn't work like design wise or whatever wise then like you know we should always put the game first right yeah not not necessarily like we said we would make sam or do a thing therefore we'll force it yeah yeah and that's kind of like one of the nice things with it kind of like doesn't really tie into this topic but it it reminds me of it like the fact that we don't have a road map is really because we want to have the options everywhere to like make choices that are best for the game and not like necessarily best for like our schedule or whatever like or or the fact that like we said this in the beginning but you know because there's a lot of things that when we started working on satisfactory felt like this is such a good thing to have and then as we go that further down the line where uh because we added this thing it doesn't really make sense in the in the context of this and like then the best option is instead of forcing it into the game we remove it and do something else with it and that's happened in the past and it's something that you know might happen in the future and you never know yep it's the journey and there's not really much point of having a road map that is meaningless essentially like if we were to just have one then but everything on it is subject to change at any time it's like okay well then what's the point of the road yeah exactly um and it feels bad to like put something on the roadmap and be like nah we removed it we're not doing it like it feels like when you if you put out a roadmap then you're you're kind of obligated to do some things you know so that's mostly why uh wise words marv wise words it is it is uh around that of course it's probably poop very good
