> that was um yeah it was a big topic on the the content list that i initially had it's actually one of the things that we have pushed back because of the sheer size of it because if we're gonna do it i would want to do it like properly like big farming uh there's a lot of potential i think the main problem that i see but it's either to be a complete side show where you you don't really need to do it which just as well maybe but then it's not as high priority or we make it part of the main progression like this alternate path to getting certain uh recipes going right um if we do it the way that i want to do it it becomes a huge huge thing huge consideration and if we don't do it that way i'm not too interested in it i think with the mall already being there even though i think that it's not fully going anymore from understood from ben which is kind of sad but um it's currently not one of our priorities to have that for 1.0 so of course the question is always will it be there for after 1.0 uh that might be the case it really depends on what we want to do at that point but yeah 1.0 don't expect it it's not going to be there pretty sure
