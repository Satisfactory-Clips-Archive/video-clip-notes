> would you recommend satisfactory because i wanted but i know it would suit me i can't really answer that question because, you need really need to be in like the right mindset i think to play satisfactory i mean i'm i will say this though i'm not big on factory games but satisfactory has been like okay like i i i let me be very clear about this okay i think factory is a great game it's very well designed and it's it's astonishingly good it's a good game okay but it's not for me, i've played it like a bunch of hours and i got like it became way too confusing for me and way too too complex, whereas i can play more with satisfactory because it's not as complex as factorio but the thing is this this is like the whole discussion between our different community communities as well is that some people really want that more complexity and some people want it more casual and i think that's kind of like where our different games you know make sense like if you're more into the if you want more complex like schematics and stuff like that and you want to build and figure that stuff out then factoria is definitely the game for you more so than satisfactory and if you want the other way around then satisfactories for you so they cannot appease different play styles and i think it's the same thing with with dyson sphere program i think that also captures a different kind of like how in depth you want to go with it, and stuff like that so yeah i i'm quoted a lot about the whole i'm not big on factory game but it it is true i'm not i'm not a huge fan of factory games, maybe that's why i can't remember what a modular frame is i can't tell the difference between an assembler and a manufacturer, so so can't really answer that question, you're gonna have to make up your mind yourself check out streams check out youtubers, check our forums blah blah blah and maybe you'll like it it's it's a little bit tricky, with, i'm dumb so well i'm not i'm also not the most clever person right but i i can get by with satisfactory so yes personally like all three games so i said dsp i think each one of them is similar but have their own approach yeah so i i mean that's kind of like is this live you better believe it's live goal experience i see you, by the way i'm streaming on on steam as well if you if you guys on twitch are wondering why i'm responding to random that's not in chat that's because we're live on steam as well, what was it talking about probably wasn't important anyways, yeah no i our we have huge respect to both you know youth cat and like they make awesome games and and we've always wanted the satisfactory to be its own thing kind of so we don't like step on their toes so to speak
