> are there features in unreal engine 5 that you guys are looking forward to I think, it's hard to say because there's so much work that's gone into the current version of unreal engine, like the this prospect of of, what they call luma and, I think it's luma mostly because we won't be able to use the other one I think that one is is interesting but like there's no telling how much work is gonna need it be needed for us to be able to support that like even just updating the smaller engine versions it's a lot of work

> and also unreal engine 5 is still like so much speculation like nobody really knows what's in it, they said that it was going to come out in early 2021 and that's definitely not happening because, it's been confirmed that 427 is the next update, or leaked rather so update unreal engine 5 isn't going to happen in like quite some time I think and if if on religion if it was happening anytime soon I think they would be showing more stuff so I don't think it's going to happen anytime soon- I don't think it's gonna happen this year to be honest, but I'm I'll I'll gladly be wrong about that that's just my my gut feeling, but we'll see we'll even see if maybe satisfactory's done by the time underlanding fight comes up, yeah we'll see we'll see- I won't like you know because unreal in five is a little bit like too good to be true so far, but epic have been putting out really good tools like the metahuman, program that they put out is amazing it's so good, it's it's like such a good tool for for game developers, for those of you who don't know metahumanist is a like right now I don't know if it's gonna be offloaded but it right now it's an online, cloud service where you can get you can make very high quality, faces, for for humans and you can customize them online and then you download like the assets for it like all the assets for needed for it and then you can take that into your pipeline for like, if you're making you know movies or if you're making games, and it's essentially like a glorified character creator, but but it gives you a lot of tools, and it's it's currently in early access and it's it's just been proven like already I'm seeing such good like use cases for it and I can't wait to see like an actual like studio I use an adoption for it, because it actually saves a ton of resources being able to access like that high fidelity from the bat tools from the bat so I'm looking forward to that so I mean epic are making amazing stuff like don't wanna downplay them because they can definitely I mean if anyone can deliver unreal engine five it's epic to be honest, but I mean we're not going to like base our development on speculation, so that's essentially that
