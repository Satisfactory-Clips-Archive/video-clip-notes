> yes I believe that is correct yes that's weird oh there we go working out yep yep now we're back okay, yeah so kickstarter, kicks kickstarter launch no sorry dave from morocco replicas launched a kickstarter for the lizard doggo plushie and like the xenobasher and a bunch of other stuff, and, that was last year and it's been going pretty well so I already spoiled a little bit here but, they also launched a cup for the the game ceramic cup, and that was a month ago or so maybe, yeah something like that yeah last month the month before yeah time for all blur I have such a hard time keeping track of time right now like everything is just the same month, the other day I was talking to my dad I was like yeah last time we met was in december I was like yeah it was which was three months ago and I was like no it was december like yeah and that was three months ago and I'm like well [ __ ] it is march true anyways so, so yeah there's been an update here on the on the cup situation because, a lot of people were like the cup is too small so dave also included a second size of the overclocked it 50 yes so there's now a 15 ounce cup which I don't know what that means in in regular, rest of the world, I can calculate that soon I'll stop my head oh yeah I can all right ready right 443.603 milliliters that's that's pretty good that's more than a can of coke, so yeah there's a bigger cup now and, maybe we should keep talking about why I'm actually on that topic I have a different in my notes whatever so anyone who's ordered the smaller cup can upgrade to the big cup if they want for free of charge, and the both of the cups are throughout the duration of march they're going to be the same price as well so yeah if you wait can I kind of double check something because I know dave is here I believe I've seen him so is it is it free of charge during march when they're both the same price or is it also free of charge to upgrade it even after march when they're not the same price that's a good question because I'm assuming that the upgrade entails to like the during the duration of the people already bought the cup yeah small one because they would have already got it during that yeah it's probably probably fine yeah yeah I guess it's just free of charge it's upgraded but we'll see if they can weigh in here yes feel free to correct anything that's wrong actually and, so yeah you're you're you're able to upgrade to the big cup if you want to if you have the smaller cup if you want both sizes you can I guess order both cups, and like I said before the the both cups are the same price during march, I'm assuming that the bigger cup is going to be more expensive after march, if you want to buy them separately and, there's also how do you someone's asking how do you upgrade it, the way you do that is you email dave directly which is, oh, is this one we should probably just drop, so drop the email it feels weird yeah but if you go to lizard.com, and or on the kickstarter page, the instructions on how to do this are on the cup page so maybe if you drop the page to the cup, from the blizzard.com page, the instructions are on that page but essentially you email, dave on the ask liz doggo at heroic replicas.com and, yeah give them your information your, order number or whatever I don't know and, they'll sort you out and there's also been a movement on like the the general kickstarter and if you're a backer of this you probably already have been given this information in your kickstarter like reward backer email thingamajig but real quick some of the replicas have been sent out and the plushies have been fabricated, and they are getting packed to get sent out so movement all around jason stop responding again this is just very, oh I saw people saying that and I know that I don't move much so I was like is it just that I wasn't moving much but no I stopped responding it is it wait is it on my end is it obs yeah it's you're not moving on in the obs thing again or here how about now there we go there we go interesting weird that it does that yeah that is weird yes I think you are correct in it yes I think you are correct yes australian internet I don't know ah feels, it looks like I mean when I just change my source then it works right which is kind of strange, our colors are messed up oh yeah of course it's open obs all right one second sorry guys I'm just gonna turn off my camera one sec we've never oh yeah right I love this I'm so sad everybody this looks so funny the camera's not working I'm spending so much money on I was [ __ ] cracking up when we were setting up before the stream and, because usually usually we we run the stream through like an rtpm rtmp server that I run, but for some reason we couldn't get that working so when we just let this discord call up like when I saw this layout in the in the stream setup [ __ ] I died three times holy [ __ ] so funny I keep forgetting that that's my profile picture and whenever people point it out to me I'm like oh yeah that is ridiculous okay so funny, so yeah those are some news regarding merch you guys, I hope you liked it I should I know I did let's you know I'm just gonna skim through my notes real quick and see if I missed something here cup yeah check the link yeah so, this lizard.com you guys if you this information that I just pertained it's all on the website, oh is that bot not working maybe it's the wrong command I forgot what the command is I thought that was the command as well maybe it's just because I know we have yeah yeah thanks for me do you want you want a job ruby manager so yeah all the information is on there it's on the cup page if you want to upgrade to the the bigger cup and you already have bought the small cup, check the link and check the cup page all the information is there as well, and if you're a kickstarter backer then check your email with the backer reward information thing I can't remember what it's called back a reward page something something all the information is there as well or on the kickstarter page as well, it's all up on the blog there as well on the updates page so yes lots of links to check is all right in europe I think that's something that's still being worked on but this is a problem that's evading us seems to be very difficult to solve but it is something that is actively being looked into but yeah yeah I mean we've been saying it for a while- I get it but like that's still the situation yeah unfortunately I wish it was different but yeah I've totally learned to appreciate how hard it is to get merch out like that has been a very humbling experience, I was on the same page as you guys like how hard can it be to get merch out apparently very hard is the answer but very hard like I guess you guys don't really get to hear like all the intricacies that we get to hear but like there's there's a lot of moving parts to get this work the whole thing rolling, more things than like and when you think about it like yeah maybe it does make sense that it is you know there's a lot of moving parts here, because the only thing you guys see is just like it's a plushie and I get it in the mail like yeah you click on the store page and then you buy it and then it shows up yeah yeah there's, yeah it's not easy it is a hassle but but we have you know there we're getting there we're making progress guys and hopefully eventually we will have some eu stuff or you know better shipping outside of us at the very least, hopefully we'll solve that we do want to sold it so I love this comment when is the toilet seat toilet dlc merch coming so we don't have the dlc but we'll get the merch out before we get the dlc out we need satisfactory toilet paper let's go we did talk about that I remember since we introduced coupons we I remember we talked about having so that like toilet paper would be the coupon like dispenser so like you'd be oh yeah yeah like the squares would be coupons or something yeah exactly so good
