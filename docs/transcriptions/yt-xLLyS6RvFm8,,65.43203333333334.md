### Transcript

> Jace: Hey everyone, my name's Jace and I'm the Community Manager at Coffee Stain Studios, and today's the last video before Update 4 is released on March 16th - this Tuesday, only a few days away - 5pm GMT, and I'm just making a video to let you know that we're going to be doing a special stream for that, starting at 1pm GMT.
>
> We normally stream on our twitch channel - twitch.tv/coffeestainstudiosdevs - but we will also be streaming here on YouTube, because it's a special occasion.
>
> So starting at 1pm GMT, we're gonna be- we gotta bunch of guests that're gonna be on, we're gonna do the Community Highlights that we normally do, and we'll be doing some other fun stuff, and then we're going to count down to the launch of the Update, and we're gonna play a video for you all.
>
> And you know last year when we did this, we played the Update 3 Trailer video, this time we're actually gonna be playing the Update 4 Patch Notes video instead of the trailer - we're gonna save the Trailer for when the Early Access version is done, so when the version is - when Update 4 is done and released to everybody, so we're gonna do the Patch Notes video.
>
> And if you haven't seen our Patch Notes videos before, I'll leave a link in the cards above to the Update 3 one.
>
> We tend to go so over the top, and make them really fun and entertaining.
>
> So I'm sure you'll all enjoy that as well.
>
> So between now and then however, I have also compiled a playlist of all of the Update 4-related things and news that has been released, so again, in the cards up here you can check out that playlist if you want to catch up or refresh yourself on all the news for Update 4 before Update 4 drops, if you want.
>
> Last thing I just want to say is that starting on Wednesday- so the day after Update 4 drops- I'm going on just sort of an extended break - an extended vacation - from work, so I will be gone for a while, but Snutt will be holding the fort of course.
>
> So take care of yourselves while I'm gone, and I'll see you when I get back.
>
> Yeah, so that's all- I hope you have a lovely weekend, and I will catch you all on Tuesday- hopefully- otherwise I'll see you whenever.
>
> Bye!
