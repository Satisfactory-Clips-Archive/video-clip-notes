### Transcript

> are you going to add achievements yeah I think that's the plan I think we do intend to once the game is finished yeah yeah where yeah yeah I would say it's still probably not even a good time to add them now so like the reason we haven't had them added them a lot all the way along was because we wanted to, the game was gonna was still in active development and like balancing and things like that should would change and so if we were to create achievements it's kind of hard to like remove achievements later, when they don't really make much sense in the game anymore or if those features are literally cut out of the game and then we might have to keep features in the game because achievements are there and you know we didn't really want that to affect the way we designed the game instead we would like to make achievements where the game is done for that state of the game and then people can, go for those achievements themselves at that point so that's the deal with achievements, we actually haven't been asked that question for quite some time so it's nice to mention it one more time in case there's any people who didn't know I really want to see like a thread somewhere about like what achievements people want to see in the game yeah that could be cool like make a steam post right now and ask what achievements do you want to see in the game because- I'm really curious actually or QA post yeah I'm really curious yeah achievous how
