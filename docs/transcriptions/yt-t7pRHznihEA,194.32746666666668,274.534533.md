> anything to report to you guys we kind
> of just have some a bit of dead air some
> free time so we uh snoot and i have some
> ideas of some content that we can do you
> know like in the past we've done
> developer highlights it would be fun to
> bring those back although i prefer to do
> those all in person and things are kind
> of weird with some people working from
> the office some from home so i'm not
> sure if that could work but we've also
> had other developers talk about specific
> topics of satisfactory certain features
> um you know we could do community
> reaction stuff so just in
> certain interactions we can do with the
> community we can create videos around
> that and so we're sort of thinking about
> like what we can do in the meantime for
> that okay so like um another idea we've
> thought of is just some more general
> youtube content that might appeal to
> people outside of just satisfactory but
> using satisfactory as kind of like a
> focal point in order to talk about it so
> it might just be generic game dev stuff
> but with the focus on satisfactory maybe
> stuff like that could be interesting as
> well just some ideas that we have but i
> figured that like you know now more than
> ever then like what do you guys think is
> there anything that you would like to
> see do you have any suggestions of any
> particular thing about satisfactory or
> coffee stain or game development or
> anything that you think would be
> interesting to make a video on and we
> can look at your suggestions as well and
> and draw ideas from that as well so uh
> do leave those in the comments below if
> you have any cool ideas of anything that
> you would like to see
