> regional pricing is available for subway gift cards too I'm lying by the way don't see me everyone my name's Jace on the program and the community manager here at coffee stain studios and this week has been wild on Monday the Simon saga finale was released if you have no idea what I'm talking about there'll be a link to the entire playlist in the description below there was a revealed trailer for our early access announcement date kind of thingy the link to that trailer will also be in the description below also there's gonna be an alpha test weekend so let's get into all the information regarding those things plus more why are we doing early access the reason we're doing early access is pretty simple the game isn't done yet and we really need the help of the community to make it better and take it all the way to love til full release so that's that's basically it how much will satisfactory cost yes we have quite a deal for you previously a few months ago we announced that the price would be three hundred dollars a month but you know what we reduced it we reduced it for you also now it you can get satisfactory for a one-time payment of $29.99 euros or 29.95 u.s. dollars so yes you're welcome regional pricing is available on the epic story not for everywhere but recently they added another 230 countries so there is regional pricing available not all regions that have regional pricing will have your local currency displayed on the epic store it'll show US dollars but you do have regional pricing and when you purchase the game it will be purchased in your local currency the other thing with regional pricing is we've had some weird comments from people saying that the adjustment doesn't make too much sense for example Metro is a game that costs more than satisfactory but in their region satisfactory costs more than Metro which doesn't make too much sense so we're looking into that now I'm not sure what the outcome will be of that we're looking into it if it remains the same it might or it will be adjusted I don't know what's gonna happen I will tell you as soon as I know I heard there's gonna be a large-scale alpha test weekend this weekend why yes there is gonna be an alpha test week and it's gonna be pretty large-scale it's gonna be for all the people who applied for the Alpha you know and then didn't get keys the people who did get keys can also participate as well but you know you were all waiting and so ported us and it was frustrating for you all and I'm so sorry but we couldn't give keys to everyone but now now we can you're gonna get the keys it's going to be March 8th at 5 p.m. GMT that's when the keys are going to be sent out and also the NBA is gonna be completely lifted people can stream and whatnot that is tomorrow March 8th 5 p.m. GMT the weekend will allow us exactly three full days it's gonna go until March 11th 5:00 p.m. GMT people who have not signed up for the Alpha you will not get the keys but the early access will be on march 19th so it's not too long until you can play it again oh and the Alpha test weekend version will not be all the content that we have so far not all the content that's in the Alpha so there are these things in the game called tiers they're like research tiers and we currently have tiers 1 to 6 but in the Alpha test weekend we are only gonna allow one to three but in the early access version it will be 1 to 6 and there are gonna be more tiers added as development continues can you tell us more about early access it will begin on March 19 you will have all the content that we have created in there that is tiers one to six research tiers from 1 to 6 not all the features that we have shown will be in the game for example trains are not available to use yet they're going to be added we've just focused on other things for now in fact we have a road map on our website on what we think is going to happen in terms of development and updates so for example we're gonna have trains soon we're gonna we're focusing on getting dedicated servers they're not in yet but we're gonna try get dedicated servers we're gonna try and get cloud saves going oh and another thing to mention is that roadmap we we are gonna continually update it just keep an eye on it it will change if we don't hit something on the roadmap like super sorry but what is there now is exactly what we intend to do can you please tell us how many people signed up for the Alpha you know what we have kept that as a closely guarded secret but now that Simon's gone I can tell you you know a lot of people some people were like you know there's nine thousand or so keys out now how could I not have gotten one yet well this is gonna tell you why you have not gone one yet we currently have just under 300 thousand people sign up for the Alpha so people who have said why can't you send everyone an alpha key that is exactly why we really couldn't do it I mean the nine thousand we got now is a lot and we had to process feedback and if we just took in if we took in more than nine thousand double nine thousand we would have been flooded with feedback to the point that we couldn't improve the game if we took him three hundred thousand people that would have been wild so this weekend for the alpha test weekend we're sending out three hundred thousand keys so really looking forward to seeing people play the game it's gonna be amazing so what's gonna happen between the Alpha test weekend and early access launch date so after the test weekend we're actually gonna be revoking everyone's keys there's kind of kind of just be this void it's around like a week long where those who got the Alpha test weekend will not have the game but the alpha testers who have already been in there they're gonna remain because we still need your help in that last week to get things ready for early access and because the NDA is lifted tomorrow Friday March 8th 5 p.m. GMT because it's lifted then and it will not come back off to that if you you know if you've recorded content if you're a youtuber for example you can upload that content if you recorded content from months ago because you're an alpha test and you've been playing all that time you can make a video and upload that I mean we ask that you say that this is like earlier in the alpha but you know go ahead and upload Klump is so excited to show what to see what you guys have created and what you're gonna be putting out I saw the system requirements of the game they looked pretty high yeah I guess they are kind of high at the moment but you know we've done a lot to optimize the game it's a really big and complex game but again we're just gonna be releasing an early access and while it's pretty good honestly at early access where we've we're not even remotely done with optimization it's just gonna keep getting better and better as we go on it just takes some time for us to do it that's all ok so that was a lot of information I really hope that it answered most questions so that I don't get bashed with more questions but if I do I'll do my best to help you if you liked the video and if you found it informative hit the like
