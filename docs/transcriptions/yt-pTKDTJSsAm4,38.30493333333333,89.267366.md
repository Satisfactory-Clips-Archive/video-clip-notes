> Alright the first thing that I want to address is last week was a doozy We released a teaser trailer for a new feature in Satisfactory that is going to be in update #3 It is a shop and there isn't much else that was said
about the shop and it was open for folks to speculate about what is this shop, what can it be used for not only that but the shop was- just check the location
of the shop and this biome looked a little different as well so if you- 
if you haven't seen that teaser trailer I will put it up here or here whichever side the cards are on 
so you can check that out So I can give a little bit more
information about the shop as well I can say that the shop will offer
some cosmetic items also some non-cosmetic items The shop will use coupons [ding!]
that you attain somehow in the game Honestly I think that's pretty much
about it but when you when you get the shop you could have a look in there and
see what's what's interesting The thing that I want to address here is
microtransactions [ding!]
