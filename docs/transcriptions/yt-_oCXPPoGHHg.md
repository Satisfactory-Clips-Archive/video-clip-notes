> i miss it jason i know you can't say but do a cartwheel if you can confirm sweet signs in update 5. the problem here is i can't cartwheel of course so like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter like whatever i do it wouldn't be considered a cartwheel anyway even if i was trying as hard as i could to confirm it if it was true was it was it confirmed or or like confirmed it the other way either way right oh okay so i could try cartwheels i can confirm one way or the other if science is coming in update 5. uh yeah by falling by falling or something yeah um somersault is acceptable oh yeah somersault still counts harder if you fall flat though right is it harder because like a somersault is like a flip isn't it like a is it like a backflip or something no that's a backflip somersault is just like jumping and turning your body or something i don't know just i don't know the specifics of somersaulting because i'm no summer saltist but uh i'm pretty sure somersaulting is just like if you just roll like you do some kind of role or talk and it's like a it's like a combination of like words right oh is that like a roll oh you like roll on the ground yeah forward roll on the floor or any roll because you can do a forward somersault in the air you can do a forward somersault on ground like were you rolling

> i'm i think because i think it's just a generic term for like rolling in somewhere it's very solid yeah just do it just do it all right yeah yeah do a kickflip but you can actually do it yeah i did a kickflip yesterday i did two kick flips yesterday oh that's a great place man no that actually is a flex either okay clicks are hard they are really hard yeah they're it's really difficult like people that i know have been skating for a long time still can't do kick flips yeah they're they're they're hard yeah what the hell are we talking about we just stole that should we yeah this whole stream is just one big stall for update five that's that's all it is that's all i've ever been
