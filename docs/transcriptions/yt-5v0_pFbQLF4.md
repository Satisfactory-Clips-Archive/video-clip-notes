### Transcript

> yeah which biome will be rebuilt I don't think any of them necessarily are going to be like rebuilt that sort of implies them going like rebuild from scratch or something but, everything's sort of just getting more attention I don't know what's next though do you know it's so hard to know because we have like two separate like branches the way we develop the game right now where we have like the world branch where people are working on like the level and then we have our development branch where people are working on the stuff that we push in updates and at some point we're going to like squeeze in the world branch into the update branch it's going to be a huge update to the world, because we figured that if we kept doing updates to the world over and over again there's going to be more and more cases where people's like factories would be buried under like mountains and stuff like that so you want to save it as much as we can, and also for other various reasons that I probably don't remember right now but, yeah there's going to be a huge world up that at some point, it's not going to be for update four but, like I remember maybe we can showcase some some of it, at a later stream, when we were more prepared like that's never gonna happen no I'm kidding, because, if if anyone's seen this, on instagram we had like a thing where every day we had like a calendar thing where we showcased like old stuff from the game and I had this thing where I showcased like a picture from the world in like, early early alpha and what it looks like now and it's such a glow up and then I showed that to hannah and she was like, -huh and then she showed me the current version and it was an even more of a glow up of the glow up from what we have yeah right and and what we had looked great like- I found like a spot I thought was like this is a finished area, so there's still more stuff to to come and like ben has showcased like the new water system we've made yeah with like where the water can like carry you and stuff like that so there's there's more there's definitely more stuff maybe we can showcase some, in the future but don't know exactly what it's coming out to the game yeah so for people asking about like a new map that's not going to happen anytime soon because like the current map is not even done just a lot of work and there's not going to be any more like new biomes or anything like that but there are going to be like improvements to the ones that we have currently and there are areas that are working progress some of the errors are I, quote unquote obviously working progress, please don't build there one one example is like the hill in the dune desert where like there's just a flat texture and it's like on top of the hill there's gonna be a lot of stuff there okay just, that's one area yeah
