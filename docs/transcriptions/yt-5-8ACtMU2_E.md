> will there be any base defense no there won't be a base defensive game yeah that's something we've never even prototyped I think no we never prototyped it we we it was a it was a plan initially the very very beginning of the game like if you were to hear it listen to the first pitch of the game and involve face defense yeah it involved you know like pollution and affecting the environment base defense is something that isn't we've decided we'll not be part of the game but, pollution is something that's still interesting to us- I wouldn't count that out but yeah I don't really know anything else about it so I think, no sanctum factory no we already made we already made two based defense games you guys you can yeah they're really good go play sanctum too could a mod do bass defense maybe I think I think I don't I wonder why there isn't one already because it's been like- I would I would love to see that like the thing is it's like it's the thing about base event it's like it's not like it's a stupid idea it's obviously a good idea yeah I would love someone else to make a mod and I would like to play with bass depend defense for like an hour okay that would be cool but like you got to remember that our point of view as game developers is we are making one thing and we've got one shot at making this one thing in the way that it is right so we can't like if we add bass defense then that bass defense can't just exist in a vacuum we need to you were ignoring the second td whoops, we could we can't just create like a feature that exists only in a vacuum with no other justification around the game without supporting it right so if we had base defense then we need to treat that as a pillar of the game and everything else must be you know be informed by the fact that this defense exists, and it's just not the game we're making yeah but if people want to like make mods for it and around with base defense for a while that's cool go for it I'd like to check that out same
