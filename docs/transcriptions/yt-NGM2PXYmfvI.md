> is there a change log for dedicated servers that's a good question actually I don't know if we're putting the patch notes together yeah with the dedicated servers if there are specific things we're doing but I think I think for the most part when we're doing fixes for dedicated servers there are part of our regular patch notes or correct me if I'm wrong I'm actually not sure I'm yeah the patch notes now see if they include dedicated server fix specific fixes yeah they do they do there's there's I've seen a couple of old ones that have like dedicated server specifications yeah so yeah check the patch notes if you want to know like specific dedicated stuff dedicated servers specifics, because technically it is the same well not technically but like we are making the same when we're making a build we're making the build for epic steam and dedicated servers so they're all part of like the same change log so to speak so it makes sense for us to add in the patch notes like any dedicated server specific parts because they are kind of in the main game as well so like, the only difference when we're making dedicated server build is is that we're stripping out anything that doesn't need to be on a headless server right so like graphics and you know that kind of stuff but it's the same game underneath the hood
