> any plans to improve general performance, I believe jase has to answer that question yes yeah yes yeah that's the one cool, yeah we we always work on general improvements, for for the game we never don't do it, it's part of every pretty much every update we do we always have you know we have people that like do nothing but but work on performance with the game essentially, and it is a it is a tricky balance because there are a couple of things that we like we can't work on until we're done with certain aspects of the game so we always have to like push them aside this goes in general for some of the bugs as well we're like yeah this stuff that we always work out on and there's like bugs that may may have been in the game for a long time and it's probably because they're part of like a system that we need to overhaul in general and it doesn't make sense to like do everything at the same time like if we were to spend you know the time that we spend would have to need to spend to fix all the bugs every time we make an update then we would wouldn't have released like we would have released like one update a year you know instead of two so it's it's it's really tricky balance you know when you're in an early access game as to what's what you how much you fix up on stuff and things like that but hopefully- I hopefully we are striking a good balance there and like what what we're sort of giving you guys in terms of new features and stuff but also like how well the game is like you know handled and stuff like that so, hopefully we'll get around to fixing everything but you know you can't fix everything in games it's just that's just like humble sometimes so yeah
