> what are the advantages and disadvantages of running experimental build the obvious disadvantages here is that your fact like is the fact that it's probably buggy it's more buggy than usual, the game is in early access yes you know it's not done, and certain bugs are left in the game because we can't work on like it's better to focus on certain bugs when we rework those systems for this update there's a bunch of systems that we needed to rework as well so for instance like with the the creature stuff for instance we've completely reworked the ai from scratch almost, from you guys's perspective it might not change too much from our point of view it's a huge change same goes with, some of the there's a bunch of other technical things where, one of the ways like we're managing how the levels are saved which will affect like how rendering is handled maybe you guys will see a huge improvement in like your frame rate maybe you won't, we see a huge gain in terms of like how our behind-the-scenes stuff is handled, so yeah like playing on x rental the games might be a bit more buggy than usual you will get like access to some of the update 6 stuff early quote unquote, you know but you know buyer beware like it is an experimental state you know once we ship it over to early access we feel like early access is sort of like a stable version for us, so if you really want to try like the bleeding edge stuff you can be an experimental, but if you want like a more stable version early access really is the the way to go you can never you can never have both unfortunately you can't have early adopter and you know bug free so yes
