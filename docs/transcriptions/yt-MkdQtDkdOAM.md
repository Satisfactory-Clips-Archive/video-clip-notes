> does the dev team have their own list of crap to do, yes we do it's it's that list is insanely long by the way because it's like every pretty much every idea we've ever had for the game as well, so here's a funny thing we have like, we use like a management system, and and all the feature lists are pretty much open to anyone to look at and we have like feature lists from like old old that we just like this is not gonna happen in the game but they're still on the board so like I don't don't think you should bring this up though no I'm not or is it gonna be a risk of, leakage no I'm not gonna show it I'm just like nice yeah it's it's it's it's insane how many the point of this was it's insane how much like thought has gone into this game and like how many like different things like different approaches we've had to different things just like never made it into the game or or we we didn't like it or it might make it or whatever like it's it's one thing like this game has been out for two three years wait something like that yeah two or three or something and note that we worked in this game for like four or five years before that yeah so a lot of thought has gone into the game before you guys even saw it
