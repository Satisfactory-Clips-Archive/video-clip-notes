> satisfactory is supposed to be DRM free
> it's not exactly but it kind of is and

> shortcut of the exe file the factory
> game one so then right click be shortcut
> and go down to properties you'll see

> at the end just put - epic portal in
> there and then click apply or okay
> whatever and then you can just launch
> the game from there thanks me now that's
> not that great of a solution again it's
> really convoluted but it is something we

> launcher as well so you'll have another
> satisfactory version in your library but
> maybe that's not good either because
> then it's gonna get all like messy
> because you're getting all these
> versions of satisfactory in there but
> it's gonna be simpler than making copies

> I don't know what do you guys want we
> don't really know what we should do
