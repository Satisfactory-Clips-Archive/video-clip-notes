> So, let's show off the self-driving, but first, on the bottom right hand, you'll see a little fuel icon, and that's where we would normally show what fuel you have, and how much. Right now there's no fuel in the vehicle, but I'm using cheats, so I can drive without fuel. All right, and then below that, it says,
'Q - Self driving menu' So I'll hold 'Q'. Now, the automation and self driving has gone through many iterations, and has changed the way it functions many times, so, maybe this will change again, but this is what we have now. You can clear a path, hide path nodes, enable autopilot and start recording. You'll see what the path nodes are in a moment, so let's hit 'Start recording' and go for a drive. You'll notice that we're pooping out little blue arrows. So that's, to be expected. I'm sure. So let's go for a little drive up here. You do need to close the circuit for the vehicles, for the automation. Because you wouldn't really want it to try and find some path back, it doesn't really work that well yet. Like you really wouldn't want that. Because, maybe you don't want it to come back the same path or something. So, we'll finish the recording. We'll enable autopilot, and even though I've enabled it, it's not driving. That is because we have a driver in the vehicle, so once we just hop out... it'll start driving. There it goes, and so here, I'm just following the vehicle as it drives around, and, the waypoint system is, you know, not super smart. It just goes from waypoint to waypoint. So, you want to be super careful, with how you record the vehicles. You want to make sure that it's a safe and reliable path. Otherwise the vehicle will get stuck, and, you know, it'll get stuck, and then it won't complete the circuit, and it'll burn off its fuel, and it's a pain in the butt to go and fix it so you want to make sure you've got a safe circuit there, and then, yeah, so these blue arrows are the path nodes, which you can hide if you wish, as well in that previous menu. So, let's move on to the Truck. The truck is super nice, I think. It's a big vehicle. It's much faster than the Tractor.
