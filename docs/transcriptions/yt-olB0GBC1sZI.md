> so so the rest of this the sich right now in the studio is oh my god I gotta turn off my phone right now because it's driving me bonkers, so this week we're gonna be rolling out a patch whoa hold your horses all right it's not a big patch, we're gonna update like some of the translations in the game and update the eos sdk I believe for reasons, and yeah we're gonna try and roll out patches the coming weeks to update localization mainly, there might be a few things here and there but I don't think I think it's mainly for localization yeah I think so because we haven't updated localization since june the last patch and our localization, community is is bonkers because they are they're being they've been going at it yeah and it's kind of fair to them to to not like update localization until you know the november update or whatever that's that's still some time off so we are going to try and get that ball rolling again indeed yes
