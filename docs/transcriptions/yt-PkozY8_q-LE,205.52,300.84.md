> *sniff* The old design of the character, so like i said before, there is so many iterations with everything and especially maybe the character. With this one we tried so many different versions, we just wanted to try out different colouring, so that's what's going on here. Cause at this point we wanted us to be able to choose your character colour, maybe that will happen, i don't know? If you look at this one and compare it to the new one, like the helmet is super different, like this is so like: i'm. going. on. my. mo. tor. bike. tonight. or whatever. The main character or whatever if you can call it that, we wanted it to be a woman. So we tried making this mainstream kind of game character, like good looking, skinny, coolish But we wanted her to be more industrial, like this mix between industrial and sci fi is a main thing with the character i guess. So this one was kind of the beginning of the character we have right now, like the direction we wanted to go in. Then we made the final one after some meetings and discussions where we wanted it to go. So we updated it a bit, adding more personality for the character. Why is it a woman? Why is it guys in every other game? like what. That's a weird question. Why shouldn't it be a woman? Jace... you are killing me!
