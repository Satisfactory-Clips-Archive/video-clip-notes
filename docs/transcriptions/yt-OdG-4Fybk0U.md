### Transcript

> somebody asked if we've checked out unreal engine five we have checked that unreal engine five uh yeah it's it's cool we can't really say whether or not we're gonna be able to use it for satisfactory uh because the uh unreal engine five is not production already and it's still in like early access um and even though like nanite and lumen are very cool technology they also have limitations to them uh that makes it kind of hard to like at this point at least being able to say like yeah that's something that we definitely want to use in the future and uh who knows like once once they're actually done with unreal engine 5 maybe we will be done with satisfactory i don't know i don't know what the production plan is for unreal engine 5 currently um but yeah a lot of people have asked us about this of like yo yo nanite looks so cool you should use that in satisfactory and it's not that simple like just upgrading to that engine version might just cause so many issues for us that it's not worth it and it's it's like a discussion we have every single time when there's a new unreal engine version even the minor ones whether or not it's worth upgrading because it it creates a lot of issues um so it really has to like outweigh the benefits wait did i say that right the the benefits really have to outweigh the all the work and the issues that it causes because like we put so much work into the current systems and the way that we implemented stuff so it's like it's not maybe sometimes worth throwing that away just because there's a new cool guy in town or whatever um let's upgrade to unreal five forehead so we have checked it out though we are checking it out and we're all very interested in it but we can't see whether or not we're gonna be able to use it before satisfactory yet so stop asking about that nominating
