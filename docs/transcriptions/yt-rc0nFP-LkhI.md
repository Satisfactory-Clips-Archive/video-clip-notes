> fix the in-game calculator please it processes the operations right to left instead of left to right changing signs when it shouldn't, so one thing i could say about that that's that's this is a highly debated topic as well, and whether we use pam does or not is, is like something we can look into, but when it comes to this type of operations you always want to be as unambiguous as you as you can be because even when i talk to people like in the community people have very different opinions of how the calculator should work, and and this is something even in the math community people have somewhat different opinions about that because even pemdas is even pemdas is ambiguous so always use parentheses that's the best way, currently, but we're probably gonna like maybe we'll make a poll or something like that and just see like what the the because i agree that it's kind of annoying that it does that

> it should follow order operations, i mean even if it did it would still not be you know it would still be ambiguous this is a problem that calculators have in general, but that's something that we can totally probably fix, i know i agree that it's a bit annoying but but it's it's like it's a habit i think when you learn at least when i learned this in school you should make it a habit to not make ambiguous calculations, because you're gonna run into, miscalculations if you do, so maybe the calculator and satisfaction is trying to teach you something that's the excuse i'm gonna run with here
