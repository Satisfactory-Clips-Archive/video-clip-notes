### Transcript

> when we plan to but is there something you'll never add to the game that you recommend modernists create instead yeah turrets turds turds turds and turrets, towers like tower defense space defense what else, I feel like there's a bunch of stuff that we always say but I keep forgetting right now cookies cookie factory stuff there's still a mod that I've been wanting for such a long time like cooking like decor and stuff but I think we're going to add that yeah I'm pretty sure we're gonna have that too like chill out on couches and stuff so why won't you add tarts because we don't believe that is in line with the direction of the game you need tarts if you have turrets then that means the creatures need to attack your factory and we don't want creatures to attack your factory yeah we don't want you, needing to worry about that it's not the kind of thing that we that's not the experience we're creating we're in for the chill build experience rather than the survival aspect the only times we want you to lose progress on your factories when we update the game
