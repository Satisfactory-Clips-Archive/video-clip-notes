> here oh boy cpu multicore the game is already multicore, we can probably improve it a little bit but to my knowledge that there's a the way the game is made it makes it really difficult to like make it more multi-threaded than it already is yeah I think there are some changes coming in the if I remember correctly based on the engine upgrade video which I'll share one more time I think I think there's going to be something that will improve it a bit, but isn't there the instancing can be yeah I think that will actually improve some yeah but that's for that will make rendering better or is that I think it was cpu because I think it had something to do with the conveyor, oh it might be the driver or something or multi I don't remember no something else okay so check that video out yeah here's the engine upgrade video I think there was something about that in here oh no I put the time stamped one just don't go oh no don't look at it in 14 seconds embarrassing
