> how tall is the dune desert mountain I don't know you could measure that because you know like how tall a wall is right, the the dimensions in the game we try to make them maybe they are fully try to make them like as realistically as possible like realistically you know what I mean like, because unreal engine is all based in like metric so so like the character is a certain height I believe the character is one point seven eight or nine 180 meters, I would leave or maybe I also remember hearing that the character the default character like the one because we based the character inside of factory on like the default character the normal engine I believe that character is really tall they're like two meters or something so we try to make it realistic but there are a few exceptions, for instance walls and windows it's very difficult to have realistic sized walls and windows in games just because of how collisions work in in games, so so you know a lot of times when you're playing a game you'll run into a like a door that's like humongous if you actually measure it out but in the game it feels like it makes sense, and I think that's the case in our like walls and then and, what's metric it's the thing that we use in air in the rest of the world except in the us chaos I'm I'm so sorry you guys are actually using metric but you're converting it to like the u.s signed the metric treaty like in the 70s but you're converting from metric to empiric, for some reason I don't know
