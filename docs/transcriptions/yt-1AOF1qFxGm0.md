### Transcript

> um would it be possible to have a map randomly generated in satisfactory that's having the replay factor uh it is that's that's sort of what i talked about way before something that we've sort of confirmed that's coming in the game at some point is that we're gonna have uh various build modes or sorry various game modes in the game probably at some point uh and these can include like uh pacifist mode or you know creative mode maybe we'll have a randomizer uh the the the thing with the randomizer is that we cannot have procedural terrain because that's a lot more work than we want to put into the game and the game cannot support procedural generation i mean it can but like we're not going to do it essentially because we don't like that kind of vibe we'd rather handcraft it but we could do theoretic like a thing where we like mix up the nodes or like the the deposits um like the bushes i believe maybe the heart maybe even the crash sites like what's in them maybe like it's possible to do sort of that kind of randomizer um in the future so if you want that please upload that on the keyway side yeah like randomized node locations like i think that could add a lot to the game and it's not too tricky to implement i think so um yeah upload that if you want to see that in the game
