> train pathing fix ah I think that's out already there's a couple of things left I think but, we pushed a bunch of train pathing fixes, on ea please check the patch notes because there are a few cases I know that people have been building in ways that we didn't anticipate so like if you're using path nodes, path signals in between stations that wasn't intended and I don't remember I don't know exactly why it worked before and now we're just like no you can't do it that way, but it's probably there's probably a bunch of passing fixes that we did and then we realized like as we did that that made it like more of a hard stop, so check the patch notes if you want more detail on that if you're still patch pathing issues pathing issues please go to our qa site, questions on satisfactorygame.com and let us know whatever other issues you have so yeah
