> how's the patch notes video coming along oh my god the patch notes video is is becoming bigger and bigger like it was pretty like I didn't think we did an ambitious passion video but it's it's it's a lot of work going into this I'm, stressing out about the amount of b-roll I need to make, in-game b-roll but it's pretty good like the video itself is pretty much like cut, we just need to add like a bunch of vo and a bunch of b-roll and, yeah it's gonna be juicy I'm looking forward to it
