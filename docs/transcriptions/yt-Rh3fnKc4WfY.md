### Transcript

> thank you all right wait where's Chase I'm back we're all good I guess it was because I restarted it OBS, if I had my echo my Reverb back at the ready that would have been great yeah yeah my my camera was muted what the hell my camera was muted yeah damn voice meter goddamn voice meter man God damn it I love a pre-record it wasn't pre-recorded hello hello hello hello everybody Welcome welcome to another stream yeah we'd be here who who would have thought I mean we're here every week but I thought it was DBZ Jace

> Frieza they coming for us I don't know what he says did you did you ever I know you sent it to me but I don't know if you actually put it anywhere online because you did do when we were what video was that that was oh yeah there was some video where I my Jace was doing some kind of voice acting for something that I was making and I gave him the direction or I don't even know if I gave her the direction but like you sound like Vegeta or something like that yeah that was the, the vamanos thing yeah that was the the Epic vamanos from update five yeah I did the screams you're like oh you sound like no Vegeta actually okay the thing I'm thinking of right now though is previously on Dragon Ball Z that was the thing yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right that's right I sounded too much like, Vegeta and so I had to change it a little bit so I had more like announcer man so Jace did send me a recording where you literally recorded like an actual clip from a Dragon Ball Z episode I don't know if you ever put that online anywhere or no I didn't yeah because I did the voice acting for it over the top of that clip right yep yeah yeah yeah yeah I want to try the previously in Dragon Ball Z but in Vegeta voice let's see if I can get it all right yeah I'm not warmed up already all right here we go close your eyes everyone think think Vegeta right the big widow's peak big hair previously on Dragon Ball Z oh you actually did it I wasn't quite right at the end it wasn't quite right at the end- I legit thought you were gonna do that God, I thought you're gonna do that howdy partner my name is Vegeta oh yeah I could I could how important howdy partner howdy howdy anyway I think we've wasted enough time what do you think you'll probably waste a bit more all right well yeah I heard you played some Final Fantasy 8 recently oh dude we'll talk about that in a second okay but but, you might you might look if you look at the agenda it's over here the agenda Reno the agenda Arena yeah so if you guys didn't see on a YouTube or on our socials or anything like that we announced that we have a new community manager in-house some people are asking where's the third one yeah yeah we're we're gonna meet her in a second but we're gonna talk about Sarah Dev first and then we'll do meter and then we'll do community highlights together with her and it's gonna be dope yeah maybe yeah maybe all right chase the the ever enthusiastic yeah that's usually all right so state of Dev what what do we have in the state of Dev actually I don't know if we have anything new to talk about really, let's see because the only thing I've written down in my notes is same as last week which but I also like when I wrote the note I don't think I realized like I don't remember what we talked about last week things are it's it's weird like there's there's been movement there's movement in the waters folks but it's like we can't really say anything about it that's the only thing yeah it's a weird thing I'm not sure what to communicate to you guys, because like we're working on up to date I if you didn't know update is is a thing that's coming, we've been kind of like vague up until we usually we are usually pretty vague if we're doing next update or not we're we are working towards 1.0 that is the goal but we are releasing an update before that as to what update it will be I think it's gonna be it's gonna be a smaller update you know yeah I mean we just say that every time yeah but this will probably be the smallest one I think there's gonna be a lot of like, system changes and update that you guys won't see, I think there's a lot of systems that we're working on that we're hopefully improve the game both for us working on the game so like the systems are better so we can do more with like the things that we are finalizing, but also like we hope to get a bunch of performance improvements and stuff like that out of the way which we also always you know we always work on performing performance Improvement but yeah I think this this update is going to be more focused on that there's going to be a bunch of, smaller things there's going to be probably a few things that we wanted to finish with other updates but we couldn't, because of time frame one thing that comes to mind is like maybe blueprints, I know we said in update seven that we weren't fully happy with blueprints and we were going to keep working on that but we also said in update six that we weren't happy with how animals were and we said we're going to update that in update seven but then we didn't so you know she like things move around a lot and and I think, it's like it's kind of tricky for us to communicate what you know what our development type is because we keep shifting things around and we try to be like as agile as possible and that's why it's so hard to like put out like a road map or anything like that constantly adapting to situations because you know we run into all sorts of roadblocks all the time it's kind of frustrating and I feel for our producers because they're always like we're going to do this now right and we're all like sure and then a week later all right guess we're changing plans because this and this and this happens yeah, yeah so, so it's it's constantly like stay I mean that's development by itself or it's it's kind of a reflex especially when when we don't set these like hard, you know feature deadlines or whatever because we want to be flexible and we want to be able to respond to like both what we think are are better ways to do things if we realize down the road that this is not the best way to do it because most often if you have like a road map and you say like this is what we're gonna do you you might end up in a situation where we promised this so we gotta do it so we should do it even though it's not it's no longer the best thing to do yeah yeah exactly golf is a good example why would we do that that's that's like sounds good it sounds good on paper but then when you actually think about it no it wasn't actually very good video you know that's what we that's what we say but yeah yeah so, with pipes pipes is a better example that's a good one, yeah but yeah I mean it is a little disappointing to come out and say like oh no news or whatever I sort of do feel bad about that but like it's just kind of how it goes guys and, we don't want to like push ourselves in a corner just so that we have more interesting things to say on stream and you know we we prioritize the development first but the cool thing is I think, we've done a decent job over the years explaining this kind of thing to you guys so most of you get it which is good but I think it's still pretty important for us to, just to keep mentioning because we might have new people come around or people forget yeah I'm out of sync people keep saying that, and I've also seen people say if you refresh steam but that sounds strange that you oh wait the [ __ ] values changed actually you might be out of sync because this is not the this is not the number I put in before Oh this is not the number yes hold up is it better now how about now I'm gonna do a clap here we are yeah do it and also refresh the browser so that the viewers the viewers are wrong much worse wait are you [ __ ] me are you [ __ ] all over my balls what about now does that actually do anything do it again kung fu movie you okay hello hello I was listening to the stream oh okay because there's a there's that added thing where if you have because you can get Delay from video and audio worse wait here no clap yeah I didn't hear a clap either that's the thing that was thrown away I hear the clap my suppression is off what are you guys on about dude it's so off my audio is super early oh really yeah super early whatever correction you did you need to go in the other direction I think damn that's so strange what about what about now, nope closer audio's still way early I love that about by the way the [ __ ] not like this yeah not like this is one of my favorites still early wow really did it mess up make some sound while I clap yep clapping clapping clapping what do I know this is so weird because the value that we set before was correct and now it is not, it's still it we need a little more this is the whole stream this is going to be the entire dude this is the highest we've ever set this this is kind of strange something break hmm this is, troubling considering we're gonna have a third person on it won't be a problem for her that's the thing yeah okay well that has to be voice meter better fix now all right is it better okay here's guys clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap fixed there we go cool awesome thanks for putting in that chat would have loved to have an entire stream where we had an audio issue and then at the end and then yeah we fixed it and then I listened into the stream I'm like oh my God why did nobody say anything something because like what usually happens is like some person says something and then I see it I'm like is it actual issue I don't see anyone else complain now snood is lagged shut up sounds like Jace is using a different mic oh no am I too no am I not big in boomi again are you big and booming no do I need to turn you down oh my God what a stream no no oh maybe I need to turn me down there we go perfect all right okay how does it sound guys fix it fine testing one two you see him is muted yeah yeah yeah didn't change yeah I did anyway that's perfect perfect all right cool perfect okay forget it we're going with it it's good enough I listened I also forgot to change the state of depth so we have to do it all over again yeah yeah yeah oh no, yeah anyway did we finish state of death like like, development is happening okay like I guess that's the the thing that maybe is more important to just get out there it's like we are working on update eight and we're working on 1.0 we're doing like two things at the same time it's kind of like, kind of tricky but, yep we will have an update, out sometime in the near future we don't have a set date yet I know we also need to, yeah yeah figure out when is a good time to sort of talk about that stuff which will probably be soon so yeah yeah I don't think, update a is super super far away if all things go well
