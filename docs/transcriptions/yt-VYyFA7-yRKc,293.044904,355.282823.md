> not gonna be major new content sorry about that, but something that we want to release very soon dm, is another rework of the conveyor networking we had done one earlier escaping me right now when exactly but yeah he's on another one because after having the latest free work up for a while and testing it and seeing how that actually works the live environment with all of you guys, realize that there's still things to fix so with this rework something, one of the major things is that it should eliminate some of the most common crashes, that are part of the conveyor networking so that's gonna be really nice to get out and in general to make our conveyor networking more stable than it is now so yeah hopefully that's going to not stay in the experimental very long and gonna go to early access pretty soon as well after it's released but we'll see about that anything can happen
