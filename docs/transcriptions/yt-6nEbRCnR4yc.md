> what did i have for breakfast i didn't have anything for breakfast today i had cereal that's some cereal did you put the cereal first the milk first no okay so i i i warm the milk up okay and apparently that's weird to a lot of people but yeah so like milk in and then milk in microwave warm it up milk out of microwave and then cereal in yeah see a lot of people like you warm up milk i don't know why that's like so weird it's so like i've been doing that since i was a kid like parents taught me and everything you know and it's so good when it's like when it's cold you know out or in the morning and then you like have like some like warm stuff it's it's not that bad it's not bad at all it's really good get another milk video yeah i have to do another one right so jace is now booted from the stream it's just gonna be me from now on but wait but, do you wait do you warm up milk or no, so here's weird here in sweden so i don't like milk in general like drinking milk is something that i don't like i can do cocoa, but then you know the the chocolate flavor is is overtaking the milk flavor but like you know cocoa can be warm cold so like i don't necessarily i i don't think it's that weird to be honest i have heard other people do this as well, that they warm up milk in cereal, maybe it's a regional thing or something yeah i don't know yeah, so but i do i do do milk in cereal but i think i'm just used to eating, cereal with cold milk so, that's that's the way i do it but nice i haven't tried warm cereal so i can't really like say that it's gross so that's that's my hot take don't don't hate it until you try it when when nobody's home you know just try it just warm it up a little bit yeah but in that case it makes sense that you put the milk in first right because you wouldn't how would you warm the milk otherwise i mean i guess you could you could warm up the cereal i guess like directly what if you what if you warm up the cereal without the milk and then you apply milk and have the cereal here anyway you know what there are people asking actual questions yeah i was gonna i'm thinking like how long can we drag this out yeah
