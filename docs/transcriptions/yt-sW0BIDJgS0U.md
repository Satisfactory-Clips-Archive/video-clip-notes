### Transcript

> and uh lastly we added also so you can save paths um so save and load paths when you've recorded a path you can just uh save it i'll leave this over here and then you can load it up in a different path and this is this is an absolute life changer uh or saver for me i this is like the thing i've been wanting for a long time um because it is frustrating to like record one path and be like oh man i need another view like i need another truck like this is enough especially when what some people have like really really long paths yeah you know and it's like gotta do that whole thing again and then do it all again and then oh we've hit something restart the whole thing again um so this is like huge we've heard people request these kind of things or and or express grievances of needing to continually record past since you know for years now so um i think this is something that a lot of people are pretty excited for and and one i guess like limitation to the system is that you can only record uh a specific path with one type of vehicle so if you recorded a path with your explorer you need to re-record that track uh for the trucks uh just because of i believe that's because of the physics or like when you're driving like they don't behave the same way or yeah it's it's sort of easy to kind of like that plus like the whole nano machines things then you can start sort of like tricking stuff where like uh a tractor went through a tiny cave or some i don't know just a specific example it went through a tiny gap but a truck can't fit through there anymore but that doesn't matter because they've got nano machines so they can just ghost they just goes through right so that's why uh basically um the other thing is like if you're using an explorer i think the nodes might be further spread apart and then so when the the thing is being simulated without physics or ghosting i think it would then go through the route quicker right so this is basically just to stop kind of cheating in that sense um yeah you could have recorded like a path with the factory cart and like i go through like really tiny nooks and crannies and then just maybe like a truck just fly for a truck exactly yeah yeah yeah
