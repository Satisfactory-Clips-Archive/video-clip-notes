> what can i tell you about train update is there a point of changing it now or will it be more than just a collision so we're going to add signals so if we have if we add collision we have to also add something to help you work with the collision of trains right and that's what the signals are going to be for um i can't really give you much more information beyond that because you know eventually we will get to a point where we can give you you know a nice package like video or something like as we do with most new features um which will have like old information in it um but yeah like what the signals would do is you would set them up so that your trains could function and avoid collision so people who have like you know a bunch of trains on one right on one train track that ain't gonna work forever that's gonna train change it's gonna train it's gonna change
