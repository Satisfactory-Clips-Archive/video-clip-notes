### Transcript

> and he plans to fix the way vehicles are done when driving on pretty much any foundation surface yes we have a couple of different directions and how we can solve that, there's a couple of ways we can solve that we are investigating like which one is the best, they all unfortunately are quite like they require a lot of change in in in the code base if if that makes sense like, like for instance one fix is to change the entire render the entire physics engine that's one way we can solve it, so we'll see what we do easy fix yeah easy don't worry about it it's a day on a day's work yeah reimplement physics how are going to be yeah change the physics of the entire game that can that can't be too hard right but that is that is that is the real talk though that is the approach we want to take, but as you may or may not imagine it's quite expensive doing it that way because it takes a lot of effort to do that which is like effort we could do on other things but yeah just take a couple of minutes gravity is not cheap that works to live by just change the bool
