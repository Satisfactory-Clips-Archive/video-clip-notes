### Transcript

> current experimental feels too easy survival is trivial, probably because yeah unresponsive animals enemies that's what I talked about before that's something that is gonna improve hopefully soon-ish but it's not supposed to be like harder than the game is on early access branch it's supposed to add more variety to the combat it's not supposed to be harder so if you're expecting the game to be more like a survival game then you're out of luck
