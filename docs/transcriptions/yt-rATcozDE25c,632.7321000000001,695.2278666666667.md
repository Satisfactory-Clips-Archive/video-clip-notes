> any plans to make more randomness like resource nodes random start locations maybe some random world elements, yeah so this is definitely a great idea especially for things like replayability we've talked about it a lot I think it just sounds like a great idea but, it seems like we're not interested in doing it anytime soon though the way that it would probably be is as a separate game mode probably so it's like a harder mode keep in mind folks that there are a lot of people who are not hardcore players of the game many folks watching this video maybe are more hardcore or asking questions you're more invested in community and the game itself so we we can't focus just on that so so it may be like make that the only game mode is what I'm saying randomness so it may be that we have to implement game modes and randomness could be one of them, we do like the idea of game modes and so I do think that that will come eventually and like who knows maybe there could be mod support for making your own game modes like that'll be cool so, definitely not an impossibility it would be super cool if we had that how's life dog [ __ ] will we ever be able
