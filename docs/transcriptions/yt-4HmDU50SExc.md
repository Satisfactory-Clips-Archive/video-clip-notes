> well more than just let us import gifts sounds like a great idea northern forest be less foggy I think so because fog overall this is also this is kind of like in tandem with the like when you're gonna fix multiplayer like the the ma world map stuff like the specifics to tie to the world map that's also something that they're working on like constantly and, it's it's a little bit a bit of a bummer because we can't release the updates of the world map as easily as like all the other stuff because we we need to do that in chunks kind of so like we're working on the world map and then at some point we'll release a chunk which is happening in update five we're releasing the the like northern forest part and the dune desert chunk so to speak and there's still a lot of stuff more to do with world map, and that's like one of those things like fix tweaking the fog levels like because depending on where you are in the world the fog affects your position differently and those are things we have to sort of tweak where those cases show up so it's like it's it's something that we're constantly working on but we can't like just push it out every so often we have to do it in chunks, but that is something that we are going to tweak and I'm pretty sure northern forest have had the fog tweaked, I can't recall having as much of an issue with northern force as in update four five so I think it's better but you guys are the judge of that once the update actually drops
