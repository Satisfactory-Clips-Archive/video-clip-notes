> let's see here what else what else yeah double up for mark iii uh the the minor exactly like it's kind of weird that you can you can overclock it to send out more than the maximum belt can right now um so that's one of those things like the best case i think i'm not saying we're gonna add it but i i this is how i assume mark thinks like i think mark thinks like the best case would be to be able to have a belt that can send more stuff but if we can't then we're gonna do like nerf the miners similar to how we did with the water like we're never gonna be able to have more than 600 cubic meters in the pipes so if if we change that we're gonna like change the ratio rather so everything's cheaper uh because 600 is definitely our max 600 is even like an issue due to precision already that's a similar thing with the belts
