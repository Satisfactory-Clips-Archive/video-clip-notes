> purposes another little change we made to the compass is when you do the scan, the way it used to work is like if there's a bunch of nodes clutched together, they will kind of like when we scan them they will all show up as like one thing, and that's great when you're like far away because if you if we always show like every single node in the compass it gets really cluttered really fast so one thing we've added is that when you're far away from a node for instance like the one I have here we have a different icon on it so like when a node is clustered, it will show up like this in the compass and if I come closer to it let me just how you doing there mr beanie but as I get closer to the cluster, it will sort of like expand and open up and now we'll scan for every single node within that cluster, so I think this is great because now it gives you a better like sense of which nodes that are in like your closed vicinity so sometimes when you've been like searching for a specific node it might be hard to like find it especially since you know the compass has like clustered them together but now you actually have a sense of like where every single individual node are making a little bit easier to find every single one when they are clustered like they are here so there you have it those are the changes
