> um so i kind of just wanted to like go through some of the things for people that may not like know a lot about the the process of of like how we work and how specifically you work with our game and like how design decisions happen and i guess game decisions overall because it's not just like it affects a lot of stuff the things that you decide upon like kind of so so kind of like what what is the decision process for for game design decisions that goes into an update such as update four you mean with regards to the the content that goes into another overall exactly like how up until the point where like you decide like okay this is getting like this is going to be a thing in the game now or this change is happening like what is the lead up to that so to speak uh at this point we have a backlog so we have collected i spent uh last year around the time that we were going into steam i spent a lot of time uh to collect a lot of feedback from community and from internal just from internal like what does everyone say want to add to the game and we've kind of made a wish list from that that at some point and presented to the team and from there we've kind of prioritized everything so we ended up with this backlog that we are still refining and now kind of putting into an internal roadmap so we didn't we know when what is happening but basically whenever we do an update we look at that and we go okay what do we still want to add and what do we want to add right now and how can we make a nice package out of the content that we still want to add and like a rounded off update uh it's a lot of production stuff going on there as well like the planning and everything of course uh and then we just start to play with those ideas that we want to add and they kind of organically uh just build up you want to iterate a lot when you build a new feature so you start from like a baseline like a prototype and then you slowly build it up to a more concise vision and then at some point it's done hopefully hopefully how beef is that backlog right now uh we've cut down a lot i think because of course if you remember snoot from the first time i did that presentation with everything in it and that was still super high level right okay you don't remember watch the stream but that was super high level and it still is very high level because we don't want to kneel down too many details uh it is really beefy but i think at this point it's more manageable before we were looking at something that we yeah it was not really doable i think with the time that we still want to work on this or that we see ourselves still working on satisfactory right something yeah what we have now is just we kind of see the end of the tunnel at least which is good because it also gives us a bit more motivation yeah that uh light at the end of the tunnel is something that if like we could work on this game for forever it feels like uh i guess at some point we just have to like put the foot down and be like this is what the final product of or not maybe not final final product satisfactory but like the the 1.0 version of satisfactory is gonna look like yeah um yeah we just need to round off that vision because like you say it is basically an infinity project you could just keep adding feature after feature production line after production line you could always add something more i think yeah but that's why it's awesome that we that we want to support mods and that mods are already doing stuff because i think there is so much potential besides the things that we want to make for the game to make it so much bigger than than it already will be once we're done with it cool
