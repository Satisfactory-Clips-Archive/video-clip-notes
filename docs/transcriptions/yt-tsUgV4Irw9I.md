### Transcript

> we're going again do we get right tracing no actually oh wait on that front would you guys well no no no would you like to see something okay yeah somebody pointed out before ray tracing, is it, I guess again so this is our instant spline mesh f rh shy ray tracing and zero so no unfortunately this does not work with ray tracing as we have not see this would going back to the other question of have we thought to add a pull request and you know get it in the engine it's things like this that we do to make our lives easy so that we can do things in a timely manner, like by not supporting ray tracing yeah I mean maybe we will in the future but that's, very few people have cards that can run it so our time is feels better spent elsewhere and I actually don't think we're ever gonna do it all right to be honest yeah I mean I just mean it's just not it's impossible but like everything's possible it's also possible that we could make everything simulated in the game but we're not going to do that either most everything is just time constraints it's a lot things take a long time
