### Transcript

> are there any plans beyond 1.0 do you see it as a completed game or will there be some minor maintenance in short what are we are we going to maintain the game after 1.0 i think we are i'm sure there's going to be bug fixes and maybe some tweaks and you know we've talked about like could we do some bigger like dlcs or something just keep in mind that when we work really hard on big dlcs or if anyone any company works really hard on dlcs that cost the company money right so sometimes they they package things in dlc so we've thought about like is that what we want to do do we just want to do free updates we'll kind of see but i don't think we're just gonna just gonna drop it at 1.0 and just be like okay bye we're gonna work on a new game now like i don't know like good simulator 2 or or sanctum 3 like we're not just gonna ditch satisfactory right away uh or that is the plan as it
