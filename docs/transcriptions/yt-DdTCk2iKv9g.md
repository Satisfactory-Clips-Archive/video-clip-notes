> what are the top three things you worked on the most i guess in satisfaction worked on the most yeah, probably trailers i think trailers is probably the ones that i remember the most because they are like such a it's a project that's right it begins and ends yeah exactly but i think like it probably added up is just like, working with the different teams like like talking to them understanding what they want to achieve and kind of helping helping them do that i i think like that's it's probably been a lot of meetings that's one thing a lot of trailer making that's one thing that i play the game a lot, to like review things right because there's a lot of like yeah there's a lot of things we iterated on a lot of times so every time we do a version of something we have to test it and play it and for a game like satisfactory you kind of want to know how it feels over a couple of hours so it's sometimes it's not that easy to just like try this new feature and it's like ah done it's usually like ah we need to use a play a little bit with it try different scenarios can you build it like this can be like that, and then you you feedback or bring up issues and then you yeah talk to the team that's that's sort of like a one thing that i i've noticed with like you and and burke as well as a producer that i that i also think must i feel like it must be hard which is probably why i shouldn't be a producer but i feel like you guys have to trust like the team a lot because i know that whenever you would go to anyone like it's often that the producers do the rounds and they go and like talk to everyone about their feelings and like what do you need basically what are you doing do you need anything, and one thing that i always found is that like whenever there's any kind of issue and it could be like i'm missing some assets it could be i'm struggling getting this thing done, or i feel bad health-wise or something like it doesn't matter what it is the producers will always just be like okay like you would just listen all the time and just like okay let's fix it whatever and that's something that's always been really good that i found that you would do and burke does as well it's almost without question and i feel like that's something that can be abused by people, if they wanted to but, obviously we don't do that and it takes like a lot of trust that you guys would have to have in the team i think that's something that's pretty like a common thing without team in general like a lot of just trust i think yeah oh definitely i and i think birk is much better at actually listening i because i i have this thing that i try to solve things immediately where sometimes you just need to listen right yeah okay like i think i think a lot of people would oh sorry god no it was a joke yeah it was a good one it was a good one no it was, yeah i think a lot of people would struggle to just do it at all like i know i would so it's pretty cool
