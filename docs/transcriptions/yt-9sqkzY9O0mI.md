### Transcript

> will building on the map always oh yeah that's another good question I saw it before as well, there's like a couple of places on the map where there's like holes, do you know how much we're gonna be able to like fix those spots for this update or is that like further down the line I mean some some of them are there by design and some of them are not there by design ideally yeah but like like there's a lot of people that for example built like underneath the cliffs in this mountain, yeah if you're still there somehow after everything that's gonna get up, that was not never intended to be a space where you can build so, those those those kinds of holes will be filled up because those are bugs but there's like in there in grass fields like there's a big sort of like hole like through the train and that one's there to say I'm sure people will find a way to still manage to get underneath the map I mean you can still do I think you can always do the thing where if you place a hyper tube entrance and you get that tube to like clip into the environment yeah you can always get through it that way yeah you dirty cheaters I can't believe it, all right all right
