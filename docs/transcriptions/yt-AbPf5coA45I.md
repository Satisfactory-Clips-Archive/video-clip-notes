> powered splitter I can turn off conveyor belts oof no there's there's a huge, well that's not the only reason but there's a huge like, what's the word for networking performance reasons there's a huge like, we're expecting conveyables to be deterministic, because conveyable like transporting stuff on conveyor belts and stuff like that is the biggest networking traffic thing like the the takes the most apart from loading in if you have a big base, so making it so that belts aren't deterministic ruins that and it also makes it that we can't, put them in parallel we can't paralyze pair I can't talk, we can't paralyze not paralyzes and like make make it run multi-threaded that's what I'm trying to say because then there's a dependency between conveyor belts too per right parallelized code parallelized parallel it's not a word whatever you get what maybe you get what I mean parallax yeah lies parallel next question words are words are hard you're not wrong
