### Transcript

> works i have another demonstration though let's let's take you to another thing that you can do with it okay so here is uh another demonstration of hard and soft clearance uh allowing you to build and play how you wanna play this is a beautiful little monstrosity that i've created unveiling it in three two one oh look at that isn't that beautiful the conveyor belts look like they're like a bow constrictor constricting the particle accelerator so you can see here that these uh the conveyor belts here you know they're going through this the loop of the particle accelerator i've got belt i've got walls in between here and you know like so in this case here like there's not really any clipping per se you know like it's not clipping the models you know i can build a conveyor belt in a conveyor pole on top of the particle accelerator if i want you know i can just build how i want so i'm not actually clipping here but i am clipping i i am clipping soft clearance with the hard clearance but the game just lets me build that now so you know i can just yeah i can just build walls if i want i can clip in if i want whatever right but to demonstrate hard clearance again like there's there's empty space here right but that is technically still part of the hard clearance of the particle accelerator so i can't build a constructor in there right you can't actually do that you need to build it outside that issue of the the the hard clearance becomes even more apparent with the cold generator which is notorious for this so the cold generator's clearance you know it's like a box right it goes from the bottom all the way to the top and this entire empty space here is also part of the clearance of the cold generator so previously you couldn't build any foundations over that space but you can now all right you get the overlapping soft clearance warning message but you can do that now right but of course you cannot build a constructor there because that is still overlapping uh that's encroaching others clearance that is overlapping the clearance of the call generator you have to build it outside of that clearance so that is uh how that's basically a good demonstration of how hard and soft clearance works i hope that makes sense i hope that was clear and i hope that's sort of exciting because you know like i mean this looks like this is ugly but i'm sure a lot of people can get away with doing some really really beautiful stuff now uh with this new change to the um the clearance okay so the last thing
