> all right hey how's it going my name is snoot and i'm one of the community managers here at coffee sting studios and it's been a little bit over a week now since we released update 4 on our experimental branch of satisfactory and we are super happy with how it's been going so far uh we're super proud of the update it's been one of the most stable releases believe it or not um that we've ever done and i just wanted to make this video real quick to just give you a little bit of an update what's going on with the update when can you expect it on the early access version of the game and just talk to you a little bit we haven't talked in a while guys so this is the moment so yeah we're super happy with update 4. uh of course there are a few bugs and some issues and maybe some balancing things that you guys may have some feedback on and if you do make sure to hit up our keyway site questions.satisfactorygame.com um and give us your feedback and report your issues make tickets upvote all that jazz if you don't know how to access the game on experimental if you're on steam right click the game and hit properties then you go into the betas tab and then you pick the drop down list you pick like experimental it's one of the options there and on the epic version of the game there should be like a satisfactory experimental version in your library somewhere around there um the we had an issue where the icon on the epic games version didn't update but the update was out and when can we expect it on the early access version you might ask and the answer to that is april 13th uh this year okay look at all the comedians out there oh does this doesn't mean 2022 i think you're so funny don't you with that said though um i just want to point out that update 4 is out on experimental but we're still making some tweaks to it and there's still some minor changes that might come to it i just wanted to kind of talk a little bit about some of those things so let me first kind of address one of the things with plutonium fuel rods um when we released the game a lot of people thought that it was a bug that you could sink the plutonium fuel rods including this guy um but that is actually intentional apparently so up until update four you weren't able to sink your nuclear waste and you still can't but there's a way to like get around that kind of where if you take your nuclear waste and use it in the new nuclear refinement process and create plutonium fuel rods those are then possible to sink in the in the awesome sink if you didn't know and that is intentional um because we want to kind of create a trade-off between whether or not it's worth using the new fuel rods in your in your nuclear power plants or if you think that waste is such a cumbersome thing that you'd rather get the waste out of your way and refine all that um and that's kind of the trade-off that we want to go with if it's worth or not you know getting the new power versus sinking it i don't know if we're gonna like enough enough i don't know if we're gonna nerf or buff the uh like the regular fuel rods or the plutonium fuel rods or how they're gonna burn or whatever one of the options we're looking at currently is making maybe uranium a bit maybe potentially a bit weaker and then make plutonium a bit stronger to kind of balance that out a little bit we'll see another thing that we're looking into is to make bauxite a little bit more expensive again we felt like the the change we did made it a little bit maybe too cheap we still wanted to be easy to find so we're not gonna like make a huge change or go back to how it was before uh but there's gonna be a little bit tweaks to that especially for the alternate versions of those recipes because we feel like those recipes are a little bit too cheap right now and what does that mean changing boxes well it's mostly some tweaks to the numbers to the recipes no changes to like the ingredients or anything like that um nothing major but the tweaks don't just apply to bauxite there may be some tweaks overall to some of the new recipes as well we haven't really decided anything yet but expect maybe some numbers to change here and there don't like no ingredients will change in the recipes but maybe some numbers there's also going to be some general tweaks to some of the alternate recipes that are new to update for um but again it's mostly related to like ratios and you know how many per minute you may need to feed to get full efficiency so don't worry about ingredients or anything like that if you are one of those people that are like oh i don't wanna i don't wanna start setting up a production line if i if i have to like make any changes whatsoever then stay away from the alternate recipes because those are the ones that are most prone for change if you have any thoughts on the balancing of things and or if you feel like there are any specific recipes that you want to see in the game make sure to upload that on the keyway site or even make tickets for it the the qa site isn't just for you know bug issues and whatnot that's also for your feedback so if you feel like some alternate recipe is too strong or too weak or you know if you want to change something with some other recipe don't be discouraged to post that kind of stuff as well on the keyway site so something else i also want to address is a bug that a lot of people actually got upset that we fixed and that was one of the bugs with there were some foundations with like a downward slope where it didn't have like any collision at all uh or some collision i'm not quite sure exactly what the state of that was but it was a bug nonetheless where some of the foundations didn't clip and that bug was kind of like fixed unintentionally because we didn't necessarily sought out to fix that bug but it kind of did now i just want to talk a little about this okay because we kind of want collision on foundations but we do understand how that was such an atu building and we really don't want to take that away from you um so what we're gonna do for now is we're gonna reintroduce that bug with the foundation stuff and in the future for for some coming update maybe the next one or the one after that we're going to look into ways to make it possible for you to build the same way without you know utilizing something unintentional with the game with like a bug like that we want you to be able to pursue those kind of creative builds and be able to do the things that you can with the limitations of the game um but we also want collision do foundations but we're gonna we're gonna work something out but but in the meantime we're gonna reintroduce that bug uh yay so yeah i just wanna really quickly bring these things up uh let you know what guys what's happening we're still working on update four uh update four is going to come out on early access on april 13th super glad that you guys like it remember to to post on our qa site questions.satisfactorygame.com if you have any feedback or if you're counting any bugs or any issues let us know and we will look into it and until then have an amazing day or week or year or month or however long it takes until you see me again so take care bye
