### Transcript

> for us it's good i've seen a few people ask what the modular build is that we mentioned so this is something that's been prompted by modding community um and god damn it i always forget what the point of that is uh but it essentially helps the modders make better uh like when they're making mods makes it easier for them uh it separates uh it's essentially like right now the the game is just one big kind of dll and then the modular build is splitting that up into segments of it so that it's easier to like load in stuff for mods they can essentially load in its plugins easier so it just makes it easier for the modders to create mods um and we were a bit hesitant to implement this in the beginning because we saw some issues with performance originally uh and then we tried it again uh fairly recently and then we didn't really see a big difference and then we have no idea why but uh

> so we're going to look into implementing that but it will happen we want to do it because it's kind of similar to the engine upgrade where it might introduce issues with the game we've already seen a few bugs happen with it and we're gonna need to fix those bugs again when we implement that modular build so we want to do it by its own so it's it's gonna happen after the engine upgrade i think sometimes
