### Transcript

> yes about how many updates will there be before 1.0 oh that's a good question, I already I know I know 100 certain that it's we have four and five planned, or are in the planning, I don't know much else apart from that because right now our planning is like we have update four it might contain this they have also a producer had like four or five different variations of this of like the plan so like in in alternative universe one we have like this is what might update four might contain here's what update five must contain and then there's just a big chunk of and it's like this is the rest of the game whatever, so we haven't really planned for like we haven't planned after update five but I think there's gonna be like a few more updates after that so at the least there's gonna be update four and update five and I would not be surprised if we make like maybe you know six or eight or something like that I'll be we don't want to work in the game for forever so you know it's kind of hard to say, and maybe like the next coming updates won't be as big or maybe we'd go for big updates and then you know maybe there aren't that many left but I don't know there's still some so much work left
