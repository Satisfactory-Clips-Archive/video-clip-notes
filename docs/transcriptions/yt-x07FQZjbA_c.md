> their internal discussions to significantly rework existing buildings like refineries so this is this is tricky because we can't first of all yes we're always talking like we're always uh measuring like perform like balancing is the word i was looking for um we're always looking into like what we can improve uh and i believe like early game we are kind of like up until coal i feel like we're pretty happy with everything so i don't think that will ever change um that's a guess on my end i'm not sure if that's actually the case but yeah the the late game and like mid game stuff that will like probably change a bit in the future but the thing is like if we do any like major change then people say files break and that's something also we we're not like we we won't we have to like make a good um what am i what am i looking for like we don't want to change those unless we really need to because it really messes up the safe but for a lot of people and yeah that's pretty much it like there are always ideas on how we can improve things so yeah but yeah we don't exactly we don't want to hold back because of that so like if we feel like yeah it's worth it then we'll do it and that was the case like with pipes we've also done that before in the past with how steel production works we changed like the recipes for steel which also broke all stitch steel
