> hey it's J spar Lake hey everyone my name is Jace I'm the community manager here at coffee stain studios and I've been away for a couple weeks I had surgery and I've been recovering I'm still not a hundred percent right now so today's video is going to be kind of short even though I've been meaning to make some big content to make up for the absence but today will be big content it's going to be a small package but a lot of information and it's going to be about the Alpha I won't be given a release date just yet but it's going to be some cool information about it all so we'll get to that in a moment next week we'll also be doing some big content again to make up for the absence of big content before ok so something I just want to start off with is we've totally noticed that the community is getting restless about the Alpha and that makes total sense that's completely our fault we keep pushing the alpha back internally and we haven't revealed any information about it we just haven't really been happy with it at this point but we also feel it's important for us to just get it out there it's an alpha you guys will help us out we should just put it out there warts and all but before we do that we just need to get some stuff fixed up so that we can get some valuable feedback from the alpha now that's not to say that we aren't happy with our progress we are but it's you know we're perfectionists and it's a little baby and so we're kind of like self-conscious about putting it out and we want it to be perfect but that's not really you know a good thing for us you know when we just need an alpha to get people to test it so we feel that we have a pretty good date for the Alpha we won't say it today but hopefully in like two to three weeks we will be putting out concrete information about the alpha you can expect it to begin within the next one to two months so that's something but hopefully like two to three weeks we can give you an exact date another thing that I can tell you about the Alpha is that it will be focused on the early game on onboarding so that's just gonna be about you know when a new player joins how are they introduced to the game can they figure out how to play well you know basic just early game stuff but of course we'll be taking feedback about any bugs or suggestions and stuff like that as well the Alpha will also be in stages so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be focusing on like one starting area of the game and and seeing how that plays in the early game and we're gonna focus on that making it look good and making it feel good and design the flow of the game well we're not locking out other areas of the map so if you want to explore go for it but those are areas that we haven't you know we're not saying they're final or anything like that they're not polished the gameplay there is maybe not perfect we just want to get one starting area right first and then we'll move on to the other ones attacking the Alpha will also be limited so that you've only got like early and I don't know like maybe mid game stuff I don't know the specifics but we don't want you diving too deep into the lake game because again we just want to test early game that's the feedback we really need we don't really need feedback on the late-game stuff now that's not that we don't have it but again we just need what's useful to us right now and also it's gonna give us an opportunity to like keep some of the cool stuff we have in like game behind wraps and we can surprise you a little bit later so I hope that information ties you over for now I think it's pretty cool info alpha related very nice and so don't forget to subscribe to this channel and smash that little Bell button you know like now I'm one of those shooting youtubers that do that but it's because in the next two to three weeks we're gonna be revealing the information about the Alpha and so you definitely want to you know be notified and make sure you see that that video when it comes out also don't forget to follow us on Twitter Facebook discord reddit the discord community is really growing as well and it's really really fun actually so yeah consider checking those out the links are in the description below and I'll catch you all next time bye
