### Transcript

> yeah alrighty which can be saved up in power storages geothermal is getting a change too instead of supplying a static amount of power I just want to say something real quickly about the power storage it was it was always interesting to me that when we like when we released it I always felt like power storage kind of lacked this weird thing where it was like it lacked a little bit of justification there was some things for the following man there was some justification for the power storage but it never really like in my mind like the designer in me was like it's never it has never really been fully justified unless you know of the particle accelerator yeah and then then yeah exactly even not I think even geothermal is not enough personally because I'm like you could have just left geothermal the same right but like so so that helps that definitely the change to geothermal makes it more interesting power storage synergizes with that that's good, but yeah but- I think it never made complete sense until we revealed the, particle accelerator no that it's like oh you need these you really need these they're important the fact that there's, dynamics in the power like consumption and, yeah per recipe as well you know exactly exactly yep okay
