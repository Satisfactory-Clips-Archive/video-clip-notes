> well why well it does that do you want to like do state of Dev or something we can do a little Jump Around the schedule that's illegal we can do that we can we can do whatever we want man oh wow it's our show holy, yeah say to Dev is that, let's see what was the last thing I talked about yesterday today was that we're currently we announced that we are doing this update seven this year we're gonna release it sometime in November it's not it's not gonna be this week obviously, it's November now yeah it is November now so I'm kind of surprised that most people haven't like jumped on the bandwagon or like where's the update but, as you may have noticed it's not this week and we it's probably going to be one of those where similar to how we did with update six where it's going to be like last second sort of when we say I guess we give you news because it's sort of up in there it's out now that would be funny though yeah if there's just like no it's it's not it's not going to be an end of November it's going to be because the idea is that we want to finish up both Early Access and experimental this year, which means that X like Early Access has to come out sometime in December, and there aren't that many days, in December we all know there's only four days in December yeah on the first day of grade Calendar's kind of wacky like that yeah yeah yeah November but which year no I said we this year I'm I'm very I look I'm very aware of that whenever I make these videos now to specify the year so, I did say this year because that's when all the comedians come out right yeah you mean 2023 oh very funny never heard that one before yeah, November has four days one day per week nice that's how that works so we will get let you guys know like maybe a week or sorry Advance maybe depending on on how things are going for us because things are going kind of up and like things are fluctuating a bit also like what goes into the the game and whatnot is also fluctuating a little bit like I made that video last was it last week or the week before where I talked about like the you know there's conveyor belts ceiling conveyor belts coming and like the, the other stuff I talked about the coupon changes we talked about on a stream last week but was it last week I made that video no it was the week before anyways, so so I remember what I had for breakfast dude I don't remember what I'm doing here but, so so there's there's, there's probably a few more things coming, that we will you know give you guys posted out we probably won't post a video this week, but there might be one next week, or there probably will be one next week with more info on what we're working on it's gonna be a good one it's gonna be good one all right yeah I saw it it's the best video we've ever made, -huh I think I'm gonna do a real quick, state of Dev again just in case people missed it, so I'm gonna it's gonna be super confusing if you're checking the VOD, yeah real quick stay to Dev again because this is the original, we had so many technical difficulties today so we got a bit delayed on the stream in general but essentially the state of Dev is that we are you know we are if you haven't seen the video I put out two weeks ago, check it out I highlight some of the stuff that's coming in update seven and I mentioned in the video that we are releasing this update this side of the year so we are going to release it in November and it is November now so it is coming very soon it's probably not going to be too like it's not going to be this week obviously, but it's probably going to be very soon ish, we might have to say like pretty like last second when the update is available because things are fluctuating a lot we are going back and forth on a lot of decisions we're sort of like in some cases we're thinking like do we do do we cut back on this feature maybe in like included in this update or do we wait until next time we do any updates if we do any updates or do we release on the way like there's a bunch of stuff going on right now and we're just trying to fit in like as much as we can into this update so things start fluctuating a lot that's why it's like it's kind of hard to say you know what's going to make it in for this update, I did make that video and I sort of go went through some of the things that we know are going to make it in some of the things that are done at this point so we're working really hard on that there's a couple more things, that- I think there's going to be one more two more things, in the update that I didn't talk about in the video actually if if we're lucky if we make it in there's like some kind of like, yeah I'll talk about it but I we probably won't be releasing a video this week we'll probably release a video next week, giving you a better state of depth because I think next week we'll have a better understanding of what we're doing because right now we have no clue what we're doing we're kind of fumbling in the dark a little bit, it's for experimental yeah so same deal as usual we plan to release experimental in November and, we and then once that's out we're gonna try and stabilize that as quickly as we can and then we'll release it on Early Access and you know November is the goal for experimental and then as soon as we can we'll get it up for Early Access Early Access will probably happen sometime in December, is the current plan at least foreign quick state of Dev and I also don't have any news on overclocking, we were actually gonna give an update on overclocking but we actually like changed our minds again

>, so the only thing I can say for for sure is that we are gonna make some kind of change to overclocking in update seven, but as to like what exactly that change is is going is is fluctuating like crazy right now, you are shut up Yuri, so so there is going to be some kind of change with overclocking but we're not 100 sure what how big of a change it's gonna be we've we've announced, that we are changing how old would Hawk and work for power generators so power generators will, the production rate will match the burn rate, right now the burn rate is linear but the outputting of the the generators aren't, and we're also changing how much water nuclear fuel, nuclear power plants will be using we're probably going to change it from 300 to 240 so you can overclock them, and yeah next I think next week we're gonna give a better state of things as to what is going to make it, if there's anything else but I think I think the biggest question for on everyone's mind really is like what we're doing with overclocking, whether we may change it or not and right now I we don't know because we're going back and forth a lot we we were actually so funny fun fact we were actually gonna like announce today sort of what we were gonna do with overclocking or this week at least, but then we changed our minds and and now it's like ah it doesn't feel good to announce it this week anymore, so so yeah just just bear with us with us for a little bit it is it is it is a little bit circumstantial, with with this update in particular
