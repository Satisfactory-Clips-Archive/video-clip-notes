### Transcript

> any plans for bigger foundations, maybe i don't know, it's it's one of those things like go to the questions website and request it there and upload that, because i don't know what the state of that is, we do know that it's tedious to place foundations and, , i haven't been in a discussion for a long time where we talked about like anything new regarding that anytime soon maybe it will come for update 4 i don't know, but yeah the biggest issue with the with just adding like the problem right now that we have like it's just adding one more foundation is that the build menu is such a mess there's so many things in the mail menu and it's so hard to find things and i think like we wouldn't hesitate to add like a bigger foundation if we figured like out a better way to like make it easy to find if you know what i mean the bill menu so i think that's probably what's stopping it
