> like a groundworks a cloud save that can be checked out independently oh that's interesting what the oh it's like a shared save file that people can check out and play or something grounded works okay, I was thinking more like there is only one Hub and all player progress is synced oh I see what you mean, no I don't know unfortunately we've designed the way that progression Works in our game so it can't be multi-progressed so we'd have to change the entire progression well- I don't understand this exactly because you're saying this only what they mean is like because there is there is only one Hub and all player progress is synced maybe I also misunderstood because I thought that meant that like having support so that you could have you know one player has their progression and another player has their own progression so like if I unlocked here too you won't have to that's right okay snooze correct okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah we're not gonna have I don't think we're gonna have individual progression maybe someone can mod it but then they would need to rewrite the entire like progression system essentially because there is it is Singleton, the way that it's developed right the way it's made right now so, you're such a Singleton man the magic term you used last time was Singleton yes it is a magic term and I and I and I know the programs are immediately about or shouldn't use Singletons you can't use Singleton sometimes okay like this don't be such a hard hat yeah any any program is you should never ever do this ever I don't know to stop just stop turn off the TV and stuff there's a place for Singleton it's just not every place that's the same that's exactly true for everything in in probably life in general actually but also it's for sure in programming pattern Commander Singleton
