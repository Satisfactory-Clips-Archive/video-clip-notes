### Transcript

> but yeah there's there's beams would you show off here I believe a little a little further yep yeah yep, and something that isn't really like, shown in the thesis video was like how they they work when you build with them they're very freeform so in this demonstration you drag it out like I think in the start of here like you can really free form these they're a little bit wonky right now because this is really working progress with the beams because they were just like we prototyped the beams and then as soon as we got like a prototype and we're like all right next thing we're going to move on because we gotta prototype more stuff so so like the beams aren't done, in the way that you interact with them there's a bunch of ux, like user experience design that still needs to be in there, but they're gonna be pretty free for them you're gonna be able to like drag them out, horizontally which is the way I actually built these, originally you can just like yeah yeah I actually there's a different build mode with these beams that I could have used that would have made this a little easier but, I forgot it at the time so, I went and you know kind of did it this way but yeah yeah but you're still going to be able to like do this freeform type of build and you can drag them like along walls so you can create like you know if you want to have like, kind of like lettering you can write stuff on the wall if you want oh yeah you can actually do that I've seen mark do that yeah it looks it looks pretty janky but it's kind of funny yeah I'm sure people could make it look good I mean people are gonna make it look good yeah people will yeah yeah, and there's like ways to I like there were other ways we could have done this scene we decided to just go with like straight up regular beams throughout the entire factory but you can like have them like stop and like go down and like make weird, patterns with them and stuff like that and like you mentioned here you can show you can put like stuff on the beams so if you want to pull like your conveyor belts on the beam you can do that they currently don't like snap to the beams they're kind of freeform on the beams so but that might be that's maybe that's okay yeah yeah maybe that's that's something we also change in the future I don't know but that's how they currently work, and I think that's how they're gonna work but you never know, and, yeah they're pretty sweet
