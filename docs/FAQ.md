> uh vr are there any plans for vr uh no plans for vr there i don't know if there ever will be vr or not uh if there is i doubt it's gonna be before one pointer comes out uh and yeah so i i don't really know if there's gonna be any vr anytime in the future it's it's one thing to just like see the thing is if we add vr it's one thing to have it just be like you can run it in vr right but you play the game normally and like that could be kind of cool enough for people but as a developer and i've talked about this before on stream but as a developer you have a lot of responsibility over what you put in a game and so when you put something in it should work well or it should be well thought out and interact with everything else so if we were to add vr i don't think we simply just adding the functionality to boot the game into vr is good enough no um i think there would be a lot of work necessary to make a vr mode actually a good experience and a crafted experience and i don't think that's something that we're we're not putting time into that in early access i don't think yeah maintain and i don't know if we're gonna do it yeah and then maintaining it right

> would you add a hypertube launcher do you want to keep the exploding method people used now so i remember i've talked about this like two weeks ago or something but like i had well was it maybe the last week yeah no i'd spoken to director mark about this once before and he was okay with that exploit being in the game because it there is kind of a trade-off and that is one that's tedious to make and two um there's like a power cost right you have to power each other yeah yeah so so but then people the obvious thing that you can say from there is like all right but what if it's like an adjustable uh hypertube so that you can just add more power to it if you want and i don't know i don't know i mean i i can't really i can't really tell you from that point on um anything i can really say is again go to the go to the qa site honestly uh leave suggestions there um that's genuinely the best the best way to go yes for sure i mean i still i still like hearing these suggestions and stuff that i i just can't do anything for you unfortunately much more than uh tell you the best place to get to your suggestions in front of the people who make decisions we're a support group for you here chad but yeah we'll listen to you oh

### [Q&A: Why can't we have custom ratio Splitters?](./transcriptions/yt-ripT8MydIjo.md) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ripT8MydIjo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ripT8MydIjo)

<details>

<summary>A transcript is available</summary>

> why can't we have custom ratio splitters you could if we made them that that's something that yeah that's definitely something we could do it's something that i personally would like but but it's also a matter of like it depends on whether or not we ultimately want to have it like you know a lot of suggestions sound good in a vacuum but when you uh put it within the context of the the game as a whole as a player experience what kind of experience you're supposed to give people and whatnot uh some suggestions kind of just throw that balance out of whack and i'm not saying that that's necessarily the case in this case but but if we didn't have one it wouldn't i don't think it would be for a technical reason it would probably be because uh designers or director or whatever would deem it to be something that like is maybe 20 uh you know maybe it cut it it will just make it so that people only ever make them i don't know i i don't make those sort of calls but that would be why you wouldn't be able to have it if we didn't put it in that's my guess i feel like that's that's a lot of truth was spoken truth

> dedicated servers we're still working on that dedicated service is problematic and has been since the start because of the client side issues um there's a lot of bugs on client that we sort of need to get around to and unfortunately a lot of issues on client might seem trivial but uh they have entailed that we have to like re rewrite a bunch of systems from multiplayer and do like client-side prediction which is a lot of work something that we we're kind of thinking of saving until later but now we're kind of realizing more and more as we get into it that uh we kind of need to do it now um so that's why dedicated service is taking so long but we are working on that still and it's not tied to any update it's just going to be like once the dedicated service is done we're just going to try and release it to everyone so that everyone try it out and and kind of beta test the data servers as well once that we're in a good state for that who all right yeah

> somebody asked if we've checked out unreal engine five we have checked that unreal engine five uh yeah it's it's cool we can't really say whether or not we're gonna be able to use it for satisfactory uh because the uh unreal engine five is not production already and it's still in like early access um and even though like nanite and lumen are very cool technology they also have limitations to them uh that makes it kind of hard to like at this point at least being able to say like yeah that's something that we definitely want to use in the future and uh who knows like once once they're actually done with unreal engine 5 maybe we will be done with satisfactory i don't know i don't know what the production plan is for unreal engine 5 currently um but yeah a lot of people have asked us about this of like yo yo nanite looks so cool you should use that in satisfactory and it's not that simple like just upgrading to that engine version might just cause so many issues for us that it's not worth it and it's it's like a discussion we have every single time when there's a new unreal engine version even the minor ones whether or not it's worth upgrading because it it creates a lot of issues um so it really has to like outweigh the benefits wait did i say that right the the benefits really have to outweigh the all the work and the issues that it causes because like we put so much work into the current systems and the way that we implemented stuff so it's like it's not maybe sometimes worth throwing that away just because there's a new cool guy in town or whatever um let's upgrade to unreal five forehead so we have checked it out though we are checking it out and we're all very interested in it but we can't see whether or not we're gonna be able to use it before satisfactory yet so stop asking about that nominating

<details>

<summary>A transcript is available</summary>

> there any plans to bring things like solar power and electric vehicles to the game i mean um i can't remember what the latest is on like green energy but uh we had thought about it a lot and i'm pretty sure we're not doing it yes mark talked about this this has been a while actually now but mark mark pretty pretty much like put down the foot when it comes to this discussion uh where so so i'm gonna do a real quick tldr for everyone that's like wishing for green energy and stuff like that so wind power and solar power are two things that we've already prototyped in the game very early on and there were two power options that we didn't like because they don't give you any interesting choices with the game with all power generators currently in the game there's always like a trade-off and there's always like a choice you make when you set it up so like with coal it's like the water and all the hassle with that and with like the fuel it's like the whole fuel production and how you balance that and then the nuclear where you make the trade off with the waste and then to extend on that you have the plutonium waste where like you have to trade off like do you want to make plutonian fuel rods you can sync them or do you want to use them as power blah blah there's always like a ton of different um trade-offs and decisions you have to make with all uh power generators in the game including the geothermal one where it doesn't give you a it fluctuates right so that's one thing we don't like about solar panel and and and winds and stuff like that and i already know what people are going to be like yeah but what if the solar panels get dirty and stuff like that that's also annoying because that adds like mechanics to the game where you have to like maintain your factory and that is super annoying that's something that we definitely don't want and also really random if we only apply it to to wind turbines you know what i mean like yeah but any other building could could get dirty or break down you know like why doesn't this apply to everything exactly um but the but the bigger problem is really that this is like an infinite builder game where like you can pretty much build however many you want and if you can build like an infinite amount of solar arrays that means you just get free power and that's also not something we think is a good idea with the game with the way it's set up right now but one thing that mark has been a little bit curious about and i'm not saying that we're going to do it because it's still i don't think we're actually gonna do it to be honest uh but one thing that mark was found a little bit interesting was water like turbines because there's a limited amount of of like waterfalls where you would be able to set these up so that's something that mark was like curious about but we don't really know if we're actually gonna do that or not um so that's the only like if if anything i mean the game is still in early access so you can never say never but i don't think we're gonna do it uh because i feel like we would have done that already if we wanted it but those that feels feels kind of unnecessary like like even with the waterfalls thing it's it's kind of just like the waterfalls are essentially a node then right and so what's the difference really between that and a geothermal right exactly you know what i mean and we're not happy with how the geothermal work either like right now so like i i don't know but that's essentially the tldr on that situation um there's one more thing i wanted to say about that i completely forgot cool but that's that's that's that's the tl they are we definitely won't add solar panel and wind um and we're very doubtful about water turbines but just for arguments there there are scotland saying power seems fairly complete at this point i you know there are some things that i know that we've talked about with power which i'm not going to mention now because i don't think we've ever mentioned it um but there are some things about power that could still be changed or reworked actually um that that could potentially make the game better or more interesting yes um and simply just like adding a new like power type like green energy or something like that uh is is there there's more ways to make things interesting than just throwing more things at it you know what i mean yes um again it's when you when you just if you're just adding something it's it's going back to just moving the goal post right like if we added hydro then people will add their hydro things in and then be like but yeah we want something else now right so that's why like simply just adding things adding more like like meat to the game doesn't necessarily uh really translate to a lot more gameplay um but but i will say this though because we we talked about this as well in the past uh when on on the topic of like powers feels complete uh like jace mentioned like you still early access like anything can happen but we feel i think we're already in a we are in a pretty good spot with power like we're pretty happy with most things power related uh update four was actually originally gonna be all about power like update 4 was originally supposed to be about you know power changes and like more dynamics to the power and like having you know uh like distance fall off and stuff like that and then we prototyped it and we felt like it's it's not really adding much to the game like it it's making things more complex but powers is a thing that comes in so early in the game um and it feels like it doesn't feel good to make it complex so early on in the game um so a lot of ideas we had for update 4 were scrapped because we just didn't feel like like eugene mentioned like adding on top of it it just doesn't add that much honestly uh solar solar is interesting because it's on during the day only uh so the the problem with that is i think it's 45 minutes day time five minutes night time yes so that means your solar power won't be working only 10 of the time yes which is honestly negligible if the game was like 50 50 or 60 40 or something like that uh i could that that could make you know a lot of sense i think um it would add more i think but with just that with with it just being like 10 percent of your game time being nighttime it doesn't really make much sense exactly so uh how you doing doing good

> one train update we don't know um something i feel like when i read on the steam forum sometimes about this uh there's a little bit of mis information maybe about about the trains in satisfactory um the trains are in early access sort of if that makes sense like when we released the train update we weren't happy with the trains fully and we even announced at that point that we were gonna like work more on trains at some point in the future this is also haven't had that pass yet yeah exactly uh this is also why this like a lot of the multiplayer bugs that you may have faced uh have been tied to trains and it's because like when we run into an issue sometimes it's worth doing like a sort of workaround solution and sometimes it's like ah it's better to save this when we actually rework the entire system and that's been the case for a lot of train issues where we know that we're gonna rework trains at some point we just don't know when so it's like not been totally worth it to like in invest a lot of time in fixing issues if we if we notice that like the issue we're trying to solve actually doesn't just like you know it's actually a lot of work to fix it um but we are going to improve trains at some point in the future that's that's we've we've decided that and what we really want to shoot for is like having some kind of signaling system or some kind of collisioning system or both uh i don't know exactly what's been decided yeah i think we've said in the past that we won both i'm pretty sure i'm also pretty sure that that's still the plan but yeah yeah so so trains are gonna get an update at some point in the future yeah um just so you guys know i've seen some people say that we're not going to do updates to the trains but we are going to do some changes to the trains and that also means that just a fyi for people that have built train tracks um when we do implement that uh similar to how we've done with other things we've changed in the game like if you set up certain train systems where adding a signaling system or a collision system on top of that wouldn't make sense then your break your your train lines are probably going to break so the recommendation i have currently without actually knowing what we're gonna do is to not have all your train lines on one single track and going back and forth i guess that's that's the only thing i think like following the the same path that like factorio does with like their multi where you kind of need like two directions with your train lines and tracks i think you're safe in those situations but i don't know that's just uh my gut feeling um

> steam workshop question mark don't know uh we have to see when we start uh doing like official mod support and how we wish to tackle that um steam workshop can make sense uh but it also doesn't make sense in some ways because we sell the game on multiple platforms right now it's epic and steam but you know maybe in the future we want to sell it on other platforms as well and we don't want people who bought the game on epic or non-steam platforms to not have access to mods right so we would like us some kind of solution that everyone can use um to access mods and so if we only have steam workshop then that won't make sense um so that could mean that it makes no sense to support steam workshop at all because then it creates a lot of work for modders who then are either need to create mods to support on different platforms or um they might end up only doing steam workshop and then everyone else misses out again so that kind of sucks so it's kind of a weird situation um but right now the way that the mods work that the unofficial modding community has done it works really well it's very easy so if you go to oh my god i'm blanking on the site what's it called physical.yeah.com.org wait fixit.app that's the one i think it's fixit.app yeah yes yes and i've got the um the mod manager modloader manager um there and it's super easy to just like um just enable a mod and then start the game so uh yep pretty pretty good solution at the moment

> these teleporters i remember when we had teleporters back in the day like before the game was out and we were like we had prototype teleporters we didn't really have them in but the uh designers just uh prototype teleporters it helped me solve a crash bug in the vehicles i've told that story yeah i think i've told us i think you can tell it again because you have to tell it again it's been a while right yeah yeah so like we had these we had these teleporters and there was this test map that i would work on and um one day i made a change to vehicles lo and behold there was like a crowd they were causing a crash and we didn't know what the hell was going on um and uh wait how did this work yeah so so uh i was like okay so what's happening so simon showed me the simon who found it and if he parked uh like an explorer on this one ramp on this level and like and then got out the explorer would just disappear and reappear somewhere else on the map but if you stayed in the explorer the game would crash and the crash logs would look at like what's crashing and it was like a berry it was crashing in a berry or something like that we're like what the hell is going on why is it berry crashing when the the vehicle disappears and um so what what ended up uh solving it was like sometimes it would crash at this berry other times it would um it wouldn't crash but the vehicle would drive out of a teleporter and we're like why is this happening and you know why is it when i parked the vehicle it comes out of the teleporter and what happened was there was like a divide by zero error in the um in the vehicle and so in a very specific case which happened if you parked on this one ramp the physics in the vehicle would divide by zero and infinite forces would be applied to the to the vehicle and so the the hitbox of the vehicle expanded to infinity within a frame and occasionally that hitbox then overlapped with one of the teleporters which reset the physics in the vehicle positioned it to the other teleporter and then it would just drive out of the teleporter so that's kind of how that was happening and and that's how i figured that out so uh i just have to go and fix that divide by zero and then everything was fine again but yeah thanks teleporter and then sometimes it would crash on the um the uh the berry thing because like the hitbox would would collide with the berry first and then the physics object would like die or some [ __ ] and yeah it was really weird it was a really weird thing so uh yeah i had uh thanks teleporter what what a nice way to like fail graciously just having it be like yeah i was like why does it drive out of the the teleporters it's so weird oh it's so funny though yeah

> i'm gonna say uh what's the current multiplayer status it's it's all right it's going it's going places it's all right i'll give it a solid six out of ten seven out of ten ten we're working i'm out ten on a good day yeah i saw a similar question about like if there's any big optimization uh updates coming like the the the tricky thing is like we've kind of like um i mentioned this before we are reworking a bunch of systems for the games to be able to like both because of technical depth and we're like we need to fix them to be able to work on other things but also to like so that we can actually do major improvements to the game it's a slow it's a marathon like it takes time we don't have any like obvious low hanging fruit and we haven't had that for a long time actually so like sometimes we figure out things in the game that we didn't know about for instance one thing that ben talked about in the um in the uh lights video was that we we noticed that the dismantle effect uh would cache kind of all the materials for all buildings in the game on like in one frame and then throw it away when you load it into the game and that wasn't something that we we realized until after we implemented the stencil drawing of the mantle effect but that was a huge gain for for like big factories and we didn't know about that so there's still a bunch of stuff we can do to improve on things like that but for the most part it's like we have like a bunch of systems that we need to build so that we can get a little bit of better performance here and there but you know all that stuff kind of trickles down and eventually you'll get a much smoother experience but it really is a marathon and there's no like one one thing to fix to fix all things um so slow and steady wins the race essentially if you go back to a bunch of builds of the game and look at play the game like you will definitely notice how much worse it was before um like i remember i remember bef when we released the ea e3 trailer um there was a factory that we we filmed in like slow motion so that we kind of like because we couldn't run that factory on the machine that we had at that time and then now that that factory is like nothing like compared to what people are running now so like there's definitely improvement to the game uh when it comes to performance and we have the receipts for that um so it's just uh it's just uh we just have to keep going so you're gonna see slow improvements but it's probably you won't probably like it also depends a little bit on your situations like sometimes people have had a factory setup that like is hugely affected by some optimization uh but for most people you probably won't notice until uh unless you go back

> can you explain the object limit so the object limit is um it's related to unreal engine's garbage collection so it's just a thing that keeps track of all the objects and helps clean them up in memory and all that kind of stuff right um and what what an object is it's not like an item in game right an object is an unreal engine game object right and and this doesn't really make too much sense to a player but if you're a developer you know like so so there could be like you know an object could be a like i think a foundation could be an object but sometimes like one single building can be made up of multiple objects so like a constructor i think historically had like four or four four or seven or something like objects in one object right so like that's and so we've done things to help like optimize that but that's what the object limit is and so the the the max limit there is just how many of those unreal engine game objects can we keep track of at a time

> somebody asked if we're planning ray tracing or dlss in the in the future so it's like let's tackle those two separately okay ray tracing uh would be cool we like it's it's like technically doable but it's not something that we feel would add anything to the game um so like there's a lot of cool that we want to spend time on making rather than doing ray tracing even though i mean we've talked about right chasing us like oh that could be a cool thing but it's not something that would necessarily add something to the game uh dlss though is a little bit different because the lss is usually tied with ray tracing where like oh if you're using gray tracing you can scale up stuff uh and that's true but there's also other aspects of dss where you can run the game at a smaller frame sorry resolution and then scale it up and that say actually saves a ton of uh like resources for your for rendering and your your gaming general so that's actually something that we're kind of interested in uh in the future the problem right now is that that's not supported in the engine version that we have the game in publicly right now so we would need to update the the game uh the the engine version um and that's that's a whole another topic for another day retracing it's just it's just a checkbox oh sure it's just a checkbox it's the same thing with the dlss thing it's like it's just a plug-in you just add the plug-in to your sure you just add the plug-in feel so please go ahead another engine upgrade coming guys brace yourself please not again so so it's just like it's it's something that's probably feasible but we don't know exactly when it will happen um but we but the dlss is the whole point of this this thing why i brought this up is because dlss actually is interesting for us ray tracing isn't something that adds something to the game but dlss can actually add a lot to the game for for people that don't have like a good enough machine to be able to run it like the same way that other people are like if you don't have a beast of a computer dlss can actually save some some resources in that regard so it's it's definitely interesting in an optimization point of view

> official world support is also something we're going to add at some point i think we kind of like it's we're in a weird spot right now with mod support because we're kind of like half supporting it uh right just because we've been helping them out so much and we spent so much time like making sure that the game works with like the modding culture right now but we don't really have official mod support because because it would be weird to just like cut off what the mod is going on right yeah we feel we would feel like if we were if we wouldn't help them like at this point because there's already so many cool mods um but but i think i think there are still a ton of things we could improve when like when we actually have mod support i think we could improve the modding like community and the tools you guys have even more uh and i don't know exactly when that will happen um but that's something that we're really looking forward to because like we don't even have mod support and there's already so many amazing mods and it's like the modern community is thriving um and it's it's also getting better all the time for for people to make mods so like we're super stoked about that so yeah that's the state of that thing

> uh is there technical reason because you only made mk5 belts and no higher uh there is a technical reason for uh why they don't go higher but there also might be a design reason for it not to be first to not be mk6 but there is there is definitely also a technical reason which you know may or may not be solvable but it becomes really hard to sort of uh at a certain point to calculate how many units can travel along the belt pass through um merges and splitters and stuff like that uh it actually actually becomes a very tricky problem like i remember quite a few years ago when the programmer at the time who was working on those belts he was obsessed with splitters and mergers for like a couple weeks straight and it was it was and i'm you know i was like you know what's what's the problem he would talk to me about it and it was actually really complicated yeah it usually is like you don't really think about when you just see like the result or like the black box or something you don't really realize like how much work goes in every because every that's the same thing every time i recently actually talked to uh one of the programmers that have been working on splitters a little bit recently and i was like hey why can't we just do this thing and he was like well you got a moment you want to sit down and they told me like all like the weird edge cases that can happen and like why why it's it's it is the way it is um so yeah it's it's complicated you guys um but also to follow up like a question i got a lot too is is the mark iii minor with like how you can't get currently in the game you can't get the full output from them if you overclock them and that's something that we're gonna uh touch upon later down the line we don't know for sure if like jace mentioned if like we're gonna solve the technical issue that's that's the reason why we can't do that currently or if we're gonna like have to rebalance all the belts in the game to match like what the highest speed we currently have you know uh and then make that the the maximum and that's kind of what we did with pipes for a while too where we know for we know for a fact we won't be able to go over 600 cubic meters per per minute we we are already kind of like does it actually work fully like i don't know it's a bit like we're kind of testing it still uh and at some point maybe we'll change that and just make it so that you know 600 is yeah still the maximum but there might be like some lower value to it that some machines use or something like that so there might be some rebalance there uh but in those three balances i'm pretty sure that it won't really affect every anyone that much it will just make like all your things offset a little bit in your recipes and then uh like if it worked before it will still work in those cases it's not like the rebalancing of recipe stuff um is my understanding of it when they explain it to me but totally explicit with the big brain here yeah let me just add a second output bam bam bam well bam so actually they've told me no that's not an easy solution either apparently oh really because of race conditions that can happen with the belts so there's it's already an issue with the com like the storage containers that can have one and two outputs it's already a problem there so that's why they don't want to do that either nice yet at least maybe they solve it

<summary>A transcript is available</summary>

> can we use beds to sleep overnight um so this is something that i've talked to mark as well about uh no is the answer to that question for a few reasons uh the biggest reason is because it doesn't make any sense for our game which is like it has like idle mechanics to it you know where your factory lines will produce stuff overnight so if you were able to like sleep over the night then you just like be speeding up time since the nights are so short currently in the game you don't really gain much from doing that
>
> [Music]
>
> and it doesn't like a lot of people would always point this out in like as a solution to like why the nights are so dark but the problem isn't that like you need to sleep to get through the nights the problem is that the nights are too dark like we need to fix the lighting in the game and this is something that we're gonna do in fact this is something that we're working on soon ish i think um yeah because we broke the lighting in in update four because we updated the engine version so that's something that we're working on fairly soon i think um so we don't like that idea of beings of sleep through the night um and some people like yeah but it could just be cosmetic and sleep tonight but it's also we find that weird um so that's why we won't do that we'll do something with the beds i think because it feels kind of weird that we have like an empty hub and you can't really do anything in there um but it's not gonna be that you're gonna be able to like sleep through the night and now we have lights yeah exactly so what's the problem sleepers of the week no sleep is for a weekend

> how long do you think the game will take to beat in 1.0 ah good question i don't know um that's a good question i actually have no idea because the story isn't going to be like the story is supposed to be sort of like sidelined to the other gameplay of the game so like you can completely play the game without caring about the story if you want to um but i think there's going to be like some some like like we expected to reach a certain tier to be able to finish the story i think so i don't know we'll see it's also like an ex aspect of like i don't think we're done with the the balance of the game either so like how long it takes to reach certain tiers i don't think we've decided yet like ah this is perfect or something

> uh can chainsaw use liquid in the future potentially we the reason why chainsaw only uses like solid biofuel up until now is because the that has that has made sense when you unlock or like rather when we intended to unlock the chainsaw and then further down the line it made sense like maybe to have other fuel and we haven't had that in the game because we haven't solved we haven't had support to like change fuels uh for the equipment and that's something that we're probably gonna do in the future i don't know exactly when that will happen um but that's why we haven't had in the game i'm pretty sure we're gonna have it at some point like turbo fuel and chainsaw or you know liquid biofuel which like what else do you use that for um so yeah

> any changes of the coloring system yes there's going to be some changes in the color system i don't know exactly what those changes are going to be that's something that is uh most likely going to change or one thing that i am i think is going to change maybe it will check my answer is like declining more and more um i think there's some issues with the coloring system that we've been putting off um such as not being to like paint vehicles and stuff like that so i think there's gonna be somewhat of an overhaul of the coloring system and the fact that we're like using srgb uh or not wait are we using linear rgb in the game or not i can't remember whatever the the color values in game aren't linear i think or they are linear wait which one is the common one hsl yeah yeah but that's not the thing i'm talking about right now because you can even if you if you if you're like in a uh if you're like on the internet you're like look up a color and you see like oh that's a nice color and you try to match it uh in the game it will still not be correct and that's because the in-game color picker is is using srgb which isn't a linear color space but most applications use color like linear color space even if you have the same hex it will not like match uh that's just because we picked one of them so we're probably gonna change that as well because i think a lot of people are confused by that uh i think a lot of people don't even realize it um and yeah we do we do use hl hsl in the color picker but that's not what i'm talking about right now um but that's something we probably will also change at some point this is like ui that probably is is like in the backlog of things uh we just haven't been prioritized well enough so we'll probably happen in alignment with the coloring system

> um what is the what is the reasoning why we don't want to add wind wind power or solar power or stuff like that uh i think both of those have the problem where that you can effectively even if you make a system around it that kind of checks for uh certain restrictions that you can just build them everywhere of course they would still effectively be limitless in in this game i think uh and we don't really want that for power like you could just build a giant solar panel field and not have to worry about the power at all which kind of defeats the point of the power system where it's supposed to be a pain in your butt every now and then and you're supposed to want to fix it and make it all run smoothly and i feel that that those kind of power supplies would take away from it because they don't have enough limitations that we can effectively uh contain the balancing off gotcha remember we we also brought up like water turbines yeah i think those will be more in the realm of what the the geysers now do yeah and right now the guys have the issue where some people actually brought this up where they feel kind of what kind of they're super weak for when you get them the amount of power that you get from them uh so we might change it as well but for the yeah water turbines i would be more interested in them because you would have to place them potentially on fast flowing rivers or waterfalls which are a limited resource so to say in the world which is more interesting in my opinion because it kind of gets you around like you can't just pop them down anywhere you actually have to find a waterfall we get up a cliff to get to the waterfall place them there connecting to your factory i think it's a more interesting way to approach power with a bit of a challenge like that than just to give a building that just produces it out of thin air gotcha free power when do we get free power

> um do you think we'll rework radar towers in what sense like are we happy because that's a pretty good point too are we happy with the the way the map works in the game with like the exploration aspects of it i think we could do a lot more with it uh also the radar tower if you think from a purely gameplay perspective then i think there could be more benefits to having it uh and the map has always been the suspension point of like we kind of wanted in the mam but then you also as a new player you don't even know that it's there uh how do you know where to get the map maybe it's just something that we should give by default or it should be way clearer that you can get it in that quartz research somehow uh there's different things there but yeah i want to do more with the map in general as well wait do you not get the map from from the map right now yeah you do yeah okay i was like oh yeah yeah yeah you get in the quartz research pretty pretty easily but the problem is that generally you don't know that it's there you have to know yeah i've seen a bunch of people are like hey why do i not have the map yet and it's like because you haven't researched it that's true yeah maybe that's one of those things you don't want to put behind a progression wall like that where yeah uh raider towers have no use uh i guess they help you like what do they actually do i've never used onex they reveal parts of the map yeah that's it right yeah because we have to think they could do more yeah we have talked about like maybe being able to like scout on the map stuff because you have the like an upgrade to your uh object scanner because right now the obvious scanner is just like it just looks so the closest one in proximity whereas the radar tower could be more like in this area you can find that's pretty cool though like you get an area of effect on the map where an object is i was also thinking it could just constantly show you what resources are within its radius so you don't have to constantly scan for them to see them that kind of becomes an issue of course with the compass but i think we can figure something out for that yeah that would already make it more practical another suggestion i think that burke gave me a while back was that if we do the logic system or the circuit system however you want to call it that could be a really cool use as well for the raider tower to potentially send data from those kind of systems over longer distances to other parts of the factory right so there is some more potential for them i think both with the map and other features that we might want to add

> um mass building like the smart mod i don't know what we've decided we keep going back and forth on this um yeah i can't i can't really say too much because we haven't decided anything yet we do want to make some i think the way we it's going to go down is first we're going to work on the the improvements to building stuff and we get that out of the way and then we take that feedback that we get from that and see if it's still an issue and stuff like that and then we build upon that because it's kind of hard to when we know that we're working on on improvements to the game in some aspect it's hard to know we want to like close in on those things before we move on to some other problem because sometimes when we introduce a new thing it can cause other problems or it can solve things and it's unnecessary to start working on stuff like that um until we've tried something else so we're gonna introduce some better build modes and stuff like that um in a coming update and then we'll take it from there

> what's the feature you wanna add to this so i personally really wanna improve the build modes uh i there are there are a lot i think we talked about this last week as well there are a few um there are a few things that really annoy me when you're building and i think there are somewhat easy to fix and they will improve building immensely so i would love to to improve some of those things first and foremost and maybe like a global grid situation but also like how you place you know um mergers and splitters i think that's one of the like places mergers and splitters uh not the fact that they don't clip on foundations when you're dragging them i'm already placed um conveyor belts and stuff like that i think that's really annoying uh stuff like you know the what are they called the the pipe connector thingies i can't remember what they're called that they rotate too i think they rotate too freely i want them to be able to clip snap it a bit better the snapping system we have for the guidelines thing when the green lines show up when you hold control that's a prototype that's not done at all um that's a prototype i made and then we're like alright i just put in the game whatever it works pipe junction thank you uh i want i want better clipping and like snapping with that so if you're if you're one of those people that like builds very methodically it just makes it so much easier to build because i think the addition of the the hover pack makes things so much better in the game i think the hover pack is like one of the best items in the game right now um so improving the the build modes would make the game a ton better imo god i love the hover pack i know it's so good right

> um any mods you want to add to vanilla at some stage i'm sure there are mods that i'm sure there are things that we already thought about that there's a mod for currently um and um look guys like we worked in this game for a long time and uh we've had the opportunity to think about this game a lot so drones for instance was something that we've like thought about before we we released this game okay uh and it's been our like backlog since then um and and and obviously when when there's a mod for something that we've like thought about but not like released that's a good sign that like this is probably good feature to implement um so uh so yeah that be like it do lights is another thing lights was actually implemented in the game uh before it was it was out if you remember the stream me and jace did where we played the old version of the game that had lights that version had lights so it's been in the game since then and and at that point lights weren't that good for the game they didn't run that well um and that's why we didn't release the game with lights uh but now we're at the point where we feel confident with our solution for lights there's still i think a little bit tweaking left to do with the lights but we as far as i know i it looks pretty good and they work pretty well um also saw the street lights and the alpha screenshots yeah and i think i think people also data mined like the uh the lights out of the game uh so you know this was coming okay and we knew it was coming and it's it's here now so good times were had by all

> um so are you pack packing the update 4 to an engine upgrade um so yeah um the engine upgrade won't go to early access before update 4 comes to early access so we will keep the engine upgrade on experimental branch as update 4 drops and then we're going to keep working on that until we feel that they both work and the main reason for that is because we there were a few like things that got way better for some people with the engine upgrade but some larger factory lines and stuff like that didn't get better um they got worse um so and that's annoying we don't want to like push the upgrade that can result in some people playing in early access getting a worse experience we would rather fix those issues before we do that and we don't have time to do that before update 4 launches so that's why we're doing it this way

> mass foundation creation um mark talked about this a while ago like before holiday vacation um where we oh maybe this was a video that jace put out but we talked about essentially that we are kind of considering you know doing some kind of um not blueprints but like some kind of similar system or or something that makes sense in our game we don't think that blueprints by like the way the blueprints are like implemented in other games like factorio we don't think that makes sense in our game but we are looking into you know some kind of similar system to that to make late game building more enjoyable as you as you may know we're still done not done with the game there's still a lot of stuff to do with it and a lot of people you know think it's tedious when you reach the end game to not be able to like you know mass build and stuff like that and we we take that into consideration uh part of the game part of what makes this game fun too is like there's two problems math mass building uh there's one where the object constraint limit with the engine that makes if if we enable more people to build bigger things then they're gonna run into that wall much quicker that's one problem the other problem is that um a lot of aspects as to what makes the game fun is the fact that you are you know this pioneer and you're hand selecting stuff and building stuff building up this everything by yourself and like these huge huge bases are really achievements from our players doing all that stuff and uh it's it's scary to remove that aspect of the game because that can really like optimize out the fun another game but we know that it's pretty tedious for a lot of people to do that stuff so we are looking into ways to improve it but i don't know right now what our intentions are um but when we hear you like it's it's not a it's not like a yeah we hear you guys uh and i can't mention i can mention somebody mentioned like the the mods that exist we have looked at the mods and we don't really like the solution um that mods have made um because we feel like like i said before it really optimized like the mods the way they are built right now they optimize out the fun out of the game for us um the way we perceive it and also like i know a lot of people gonna be like no but a lot of people download the mods but our core game player base do not download those mods um so it's it's a it's a shitty answer but uh yeah it's it's like there's always that case when you know we have our opinions of what we don't want to do with the game and what we think are best for the game and then you know you guys definitely have good suggestions too it's not that we're saying like our no our mega brains are we're much since like our mega brains have the right answers and like this is how a game is supposed to be uh every design decision affects a lot of the game and uh it's it's um it's really tricky it's really tricky so that's why we're a bit hesitant to just like throw in you know multi build modes and stuff like that so yeah

> here oh boy cpu multicore the game is already multicore um we can probably improve it a little bit but to my knowledge that there's a the way the game is made it makes it really difficult to like make it more multi-threaded than it already is yeah i think there are some changes coming in the if i remember correctly based on the engine upgrade video which i'll share one more time i think i think there's going to be something that will improve it a bit um but isn't there the instancing can be yeah i think that will actually improve some yeah but that's for that will make rendering better or is that i think it was cpu because i think it had something to do with the conveyor uh oh it might be the driver or something or multi i don't remember no something else okay so check that video out yeah here's the engine upgrade video i think there was something about that in here oh no i put the time stamped one just don't go oh no don't look at it in 14 seconds embarrassing

> right here uh now that you guys have a big boy obviously are you planning on hiring uh a lot more people to fill it out actually i think we just stopped hiring yeah um and so we got some extra people i i the plan is not to fill it out um if you grow it like growing a dev studio the bigger it gets the harder it is to do anything so you kind of want to get you need to find a really good balance between the number of people you have and what you're outputting and so so like just filling it out because we have the space and i suppose we probably may i don't know mate let's just say hypothetically we had the money for it as well is not automatically a good thing to do so um yeah but at this at this point point i don't really know what the plan is but from what i understand we're kind of done hiring for a little while yeah as far as i know too i think we uh the feeling i'll this is my take on it but it feels like coffee also has like more like a long-term thinking so we don't even if we could have like 60 people right now we wouldn't do it because it wouldn't make sense for us yeah
