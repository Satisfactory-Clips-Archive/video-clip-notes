> some people multiplayer fixes when multiplayer fixes are happening uh all the time i don't know if your specific multiplayer issue because it's not one issue it's many issues that we sort of need to fix up for and we are constantly working on multiple effects it's like every single patch almost has a some form of optimization or effects for multiplayer stuff yeah uh yeah in update five there are heaps of up like systems that we took put in place to fix a lot of the issues that people are having but you know this is this is going to be something that we're going to be working on for the whole duration of early access pretty much um solving issues like that and with multiple specifically because it's a it's a multiplayer is is really you know to put it mildly like it's a it's a tricky problem to solve so uh yeah yeah we're constantly working on that stuff um if if folks are having issues with like their it like it seems like they're like epic isn't logging in or something or you can only create offline sessions and stuff like that especially if you're playing from steam uh or if you get this error that says incompatible um oh god damn it one second uh sorry one moment guys that that could be yeah sorry getting a message from on facebook from my dad um this is frustrating just tell them you're streaming yeah it's like i'm trying to find the uh the url for this thing but i'm not exactly sure what you're uh looking for yeah the thing where i found it okay yeah so um yeah if you have this issue where it says like incompatible accounts or if your your uh steam or your epic thing isn't logging in or something like that it could be that like on the eos back end that we use for all the networking um it could be that your your accounts are mismatched so like if you're if you're playing from steam and you've connected you've linked your epic account but they're not actually linked correctly a fix for that is to actually just unlink them and relink them however you can't do that yourself we have to do that for you and i hesitate to do this on stream but you can use this url and there's a form you can submit on that form if for any reason you want to unlink your steem and epic accounts um and maybe because you just don't want them linked but also you can unlink them and then the next time you start the game you can then re-link them again if you want and that sometimes fixes those issues from people so if you're having like incompatible steam and epic account or something error message popping up or your epic isn't logging in you can always try that form uh it'll it'll send me your details and then i'll uh unlink them manually and then hopefully it'll be fixed after we are looking for another way that uh either to avoid the issue entirely to begin with because this shouldn't be happening to begin with we don't really know why that's happening um but also like it would be nice if maybe something at some point down the the line if possible we can have it so that y'all can unlink it yourself but at the moment you have to go through that so true story yep

> uh will the save times be reduced we'll do what we can to sort of reduce them but like ultimately with this kind of game where it is like an infinitely building infinitely scaling game uh a reality is that the save times will kind of just get kind of long but we'll do what we can to make it a bit a bit better so we've always wanted to improve the save time and we have like a couple of ideas what we can do to fix it but uh it's it's there are always like things that sort of get in the way we would only be moving the goal posts you know which is still okay like like any benefit we can we can have is still better than you know better than nothing but like you know if we half the the time that you know it takes to save you'll get back up to that same time amount of time and again anyway so yeah eventually but yeah

> um somebody asked about console release actually i haven't seen much of this question lately but oh yeah here we go we're here we're back console release uh we don't have anything planned for that right now because we want to finish the game before we look into that stuff it's it's not impossible but don't know right now they're just bigger fish to fry right now like yes fixing the bugs that we have improving optimization and then like rounding out the game's design you know there are some features like we don't want to just add features just because we can like the things that we add we feel are things that are missing from the game for the game to be a complete game you know they're missing specific things and so that's what we we want to solve all those design issues which will result in like art issues and programming issues right so that's the kind of stuff that we're focusing on right now yeah we'd rather put those resources into making the game better than putting it out on more platforms making it complete you know like when we go to early access feel that it's our responsibility that when people buy the game from us that we finish the game so that is you know that's kind of our priority

> i miss it jason i know you can't say but do a cartwheel if you can confirm sweet signs in update 5. the problem here is i can't cartwheel of course so like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter like whatever i do it wouldn't be considered a cartwheel anyway even if i was trying as hard as i could to confirm it if it was true was it was it confirmed or or like confirmed it the other way either way right oh okay so i could try cartwheels i can confirm one way or the other if science is coming in update 5. uh yeah by falling by falling or something yeah um somersault is acceptable oh yeah somersault still counts harder if you fall flat though right is it harder because like a somersault is like a flip isn't it like a is it like a backflip or something no that's a backflip somersault is just like jumping and turning your body or something i don't know just i don't know the specifics of somersaulting because i'm no summer saltist but uh i'm pretty sure somersaulting is just like if you just roll like you do some kind of role or talk and it's like a it's like a combination of like words right oh is that like a roll oh you like roll on the ground yeah forward roll on the floor or any roll because you can do a forward somersault in the air you can do a forward somersault on ground like were you rolling
>
> [Music]
>
> i'm i think because i think it's just a generic term for like rolling in somewhere it's very solid yeah just do it just do it all right yeah yeah do a kickflip but you can actually do it yeah i did a kickflip yesterday i did two kick flips yesterday oh that's a great place man no that actually is a flex either okay clicks are hard they are really hard yeah they're it's really difficult like people that i know have been skating for a long time still can't do kick flips yeah they're they're they're hard yeah what the hell are we talking about we just stole that should we yeah this whole stream is just one big stall for update five that's that's all it is that's all i've ever been

> uh so why can we okay here's a question as well that came up a few times and i got some dms about it actually why can we not put a second person in the buggy so the game used to have the ability to have a passenger in vehicles in all vehicles including the um the little sugar cube and stuff um we removed that at some point i asked mark mark recently why why did we why did we remove it he was like i forget we will never know yeah so i never know for from from his memory he was like i think it's an effort versus value issue there might have been some issues with networking but i think it's something that we'll like we'll look at it again and see if we want to do it but but yeah uh the the actual answer right now is is i forgot that's very own brand that doesn't mean there wasn't a reason it's just we forgot what the reason was okay i love it when um maybe it's not a good reason anymore maybe you know when we revisit it maybe it's a good reason to put it back in but we'll see i love it whenever this happens a lot for me like whenever like we've decided on something or like went through like oh this is a blah blah blah this is how we're gonna do it all right cool we decided now and then like half a year later we go back to like let's do that thing why do we do why didn't we do it this way i don't remember like oh i mean we did this recently when it comes to community management yeah forever right stuff it was like we had some plan and we were like going gung-ho ahead for this plan yeah and then and then we'll just like wait why are we doing this again everyone's like i remember in february we knew why we were doing it we had a really good reason yeah we had a great reason for why we were doing this specific thing and no one knew what it was and we ended up just like double backing on it we're like all right let's just change the plans it's so funny because like you can't really like oh it's what it doesn't it doesn't seem like smart way to do it but i guess we aren't doing but like we should also challenge the fact that we didn't do it this way and like and then you run into like oh this was why and then like you just feel dumb i feel like that happens way too much with me specifically what if you see him i forgot yeah that's true

> is satisfactory called factory game in the project code for unreal yes um i heard i've heard yes exactly it is uh correct i've heard that it is quite hard to change it and a lot of tools i use show the true name of application called color factor game yeah so we called it factory game and you're right it is hard to change which is why we haven't changed it i don't know if or when we ever will um the longer we we go into this the harder it gets changing the name um but like this is a this is a somewhat common problem for unreal engine games specifically i know that like arc is still called shooter game which is like the name of the template project in unreal engine when you like when you boot up unreal engine you can pick like if you want like a clean template like if you want a clean project with nothing in it or if you want like a template project with like some base functionality in it and uh one of them is called shooter game which is like a first person shooter like it's it's it's unreal tournaments like in a small like yeah segmented like thing yeah i think i think i don't talk was sangdom called furious i can't remember now that you mention it that because i know i know that it was called like i know that the the the code classes and stuff were sg yeah and i don't know if it was sanctum game or shooter game that's a good question and i get the feeling that when they started making the project they probably didn't know the game was called sanctum that's my assumption stargate you're right it is stargate game very good coffee stain got the license thing for that make a game for it yeah and i'm pretty sure like factory game is also based on that template uh with the first person shooter thing maybe i feel like most first-person games in a real engine usually based on that but i don't know yeah but we call it factory game because we didn't want to call it shooter game because it's confusing and it's not a shooter game yeah it's a factory game it is yeah uh sure glad yeah i'm sure glad we couldn't didn't call it factorio 3d game when we started that project well that would have been weird yeah whoops

> will there be any fixes for multiplayer's sync issues life forces trees being cut i'm not sure exactly what multiplayer fixes will be done but we always do work on them and with every major update there's always a whole host of like bug fixes uh from all areas of the game right so uh i don't know exactly if the the bugs that you're experiencing uh or that you're talking about here those specifically have been fixed but there's no doubt in my mind that a lot of bugs will have been fixed um so yeah hopefully hopefully it does take care of the ones that you're running into yeah it has to be a party pooper but i don't think we're going to be able to have time to fix that particular issue um because that's a huge system overall i guess okay but we we we sort of maybe we'll make like a some kind of like half solution or something i don't know but that's a huge uh problem this exists in there for a long time we kind of need to redo the whole like foliage system so that's not something we have time to do for this update he thinks it's but for the record um it's mostly just a visual issue sort of like on the server and everything still works the way it's supposed to so like if you run into that issue um like you can still pick up stuff sometimes if if it's correct unless something is really weird which also can be the case but like for the most part i think a lot of people are used to it by now too like where you just run around like hope to pick up foliage sometimes sometimes you get it sometimes you don't

> if i had to guess i think trains are going to behave sort of similar to how they did with land before um but they will collide with other trains i uh first i'm guessing um i think the thing we want to get in is collision without the trains and like signaling so that you have you know you need to manage your your training lines in a different way i don't think we care too much about like clipping with the environment like it's a similar thing with like conveyor belts like that if we need to fix the clipping issues with the trails uh the trains in in the terrain with the trains train lines then why aren't we fixing it for the conveyor belts you know so and the conveyor belts are like kind of an active choice that we don't want to like overdo or limit like what you can do with the game so like if clipping annoys you then you won't clip you know you won't build your factory's clipping and if you don't mind clipping um and also you get like a little bit more freedom then clipping is is enabled sort of or available to you um so i think that's sort of the approach that we're going to take with trains as well no i can't say for sure because we haven't reached that point where we've made a decision on that because we need to work on it first but so yeah that's that's i think that's my take on that as right now there will be train signals yes at some point there will be train signals

> um would it be possible to have a map randomly generated in satisfactory that's having the replay factor uh it is that's that's sort of what i talked about way before something that we've sort of confirmed that's coming in the game at some point is that we're gonna have uh various build modes or sorry various game modes in the game probably at some point uh and these can include like uh pacifist mode or you know creative mode maybe we'll have a randomizer uh the the the thing with the randomizer is that we cannot have procedural terrain because that's a lot more work than we want to put into the game and the game cannot support procedural generation i mean it can but like we're not going to do it essentially because we don't like that kind of vibe we'd rather handcraft it but we could do theoretic like a thing where we like mix up the nodes or like the the deposits um like the bushes i believe maybe the heart maybe even the crash sites like what's in them maybe like it's possible to do sort of that kind of randomizer um in the future so if you want that please upload that on the keyway side yeah like randomized node locations like i think that could add a lot to the game and it's not too tricky to implement i think so um yeah upload that if you want to see that in the game

> uh any chance for improved control support it's always possible um i i don't know what our like official stance is anymore unlike control yeah i think we want it but but like but no so i i it's actually something that's been thrown around a little bit more in like in discussion recently too so i don't think there's been any really like any decision has been made internally on whether or not we're going to do another possible control support or if we aim on having complete control support or if we at the very least uh have it so that you can map controllers to f to functions so people who need those kind of things for like accessibility reasons can just do that um yeah we're not really sure to what extent we're gonna do control support at this stage but um yeah it is something that has popped up again in conversation within the studio recently so yeah we'll sort of see don't don't have an answer for you though and if you guys are curious like if you haven't heard before uh like the main reason why we haven't really had control support is because every time we update the game we also have to like maintain control and support and there's a lot of elements to the game that like we have to maintain all the time every time we work on the game and since we're in early access and we're developing the game it's it's so much effort to just like every time we add a feature go back to the controller mapping and be like all right i'm going to fix it so it works with that and then go back to the feature and then sometimes maybe they don't work well together um so like it's it's it's one of those things where like it takes a lot of development effort that sort of we're going to have to revisit at some point anyways if we want to do it so like the closest might as well just do it at the end exactly um and i know it sucks for like people that maybe have like disabilities or like want accessibility options in the game there are some ways to like use steam if you're if you own the game on steam um to use the steam mapping thingamajig i'm not quite sure exactly how it works because i've never done it but some people have pointed out that it is possible to like play most of the game on the controller uh currently using that uh but i'm not exactly sure how it works but i'm sure there are some guides or some people out there that can help you out but that's the main reason why we haven't done it so far

> uh from dev to dev how do the calculations work so that all factories keep running if they're not actively loaded are you calculating every item constantly no it's like the the factories have their own tick like thread uh if i'm not incorrect um yeah they have their own like factory thread that runs at its own speed and stuff so that kind of stuff isn't they're they're not like tied to the map that's loaded so all the stuff that's being built is like built on a different level to the rest of the map yeah like all the logic of all the factory buildings are always running i mean um yeah at the same time and that's how the calculations are done and then sometimes you see their visual representation when you walk closer yep you can check off another mansplaining there actually i think you explained it that more correctly than i did because i i said that that they're actually on a different level but they're not on a different level it's just a different different thread yeah i mean yeah they are like that they are okay i mean they are on a different they're on the like the the the the persistent levels i mean it's that's that is true

> vamanos does satisfactory have official mod support so satisfactory currently does not have official mod support but we do intend on doing that uh you know adding it into the game at some point in the future we don't really know when that's going to be or what that's going to look like yet at this stage so uh you know once we do know i'll you know make another video in the future and let you all know about that but at this stage we don't really know however there is a thriving unofficial modding community out there so um if you're interested in playing satisfactory with mods i'm going to leave some links in the description down below to the fixit.app website which is a website that has like all the mods on it it also has links to the satisfactory mod manager which is a tool to install and play satisfactory with mods super super easy to use that thing's like voodoo magic it's amazing and then also i'm gonna leave another link down there to the unofficial modding community discord a lot of people there are super active there as well so if you want to start playing with mods or have questions you can go there and ask them if you want to get into modding as well i'm sure you can go and ask there and they can point you in the right direction as well are you okay with people modding

> any more holiday events i don't know maybe we sort of we sort of like uh come up with it in the last minute uh and depending on how things look if um making a holiday event is just like not a good idea because we need to get other things done first or whatever then we won't do it i mean we you know we could always get more done instead of doing a holiday event but one other benefit that comes from doing a holiday event is one uh promotionally it's good because a lot of people like it and they share stuff right but the other thing is it's also really fun for the devs to to have this like to to take a break from like the serious work of satisfactory and just go crazy for a little bit and and do something new and get their creative juices flowing and don't feel too you know bogged down by um restrictions of uh the rest of the game so so sometimes taking a break and doing holiday events is really good for the developers makes them feel good and uh usually people really appreciate it so it's it's certainly something that if i went and asked people would you like to do another like christmas event or whatever holiday event uh i'm pretty sure people would say yeah they would it's just a matter of whether or not we actually do

> uh when do we get a map updating for us so i can actually play the game without having uh without keep having in mind my instructors might disappear and stuff uh well so the reality is you're playing an early access game so you know that's that's probably that's likely gonna happen you know sometime soon when we do do the map update um but that's probably not gonna be the last time we do a map update right so this is kind of like you know uh something you're gonna have to just kind of deal with with the fact that we're in early access however um hopefully the plan is hopefully in the next few weeks uh i will be able to release some information about the world update um and with it i would like to try and just give some sort of like map with some like hotspots of regions that have been modified so that people can sort of uh plan ahead right but the thing is you know the game is designed so that you can build wherever you want so it's it's just likely that there are people out there that have just built in the hot spots of where we've made massive um modifications we've had it before where people have factories that end up being inside a mountain or underground and that's likely just going to happen again but hopefully with with um you know releasing that information when i do um with a map and some hotspots we can mitigate that kind of damage to give people some time to try and move their factories to a different location um but that's that's always going to be a pain like even moving like like what if your factory is in a hot spot right you're gonna have to move the whole thing it's gonna be a pain no matter what but it is it is kind of the nature of early access and we don't want to you know we're striving for a good 1.0 game and we don't want to be like well you know the world would look better if we made it like this but we you know it may scrub some factories so we're not going to do it you know we don't want to do that we do have to put the game first at the end of the day and that doesn't mean some people are going to get kind of screwed over by it to be honest when uh the world does change you know just some safe spots we can move yeah yeah yeah we'll do that sometime soon before like well before the update so that you'll have a lot of time to move things if you want to move things but no doubt they're gonna be no doubt the world is gonna change on top of your factories some of y'all uh a lot of work is gonna be taking place in the northern forest we have talked about that but yeah i i would like to i'll talk to hannah in the future and when we when we do release a video we'll try and release something that um will be as helpful as possible to uh ensure that people can safely move their factories

> any thoughts about non-first-person building mode especially when landing tracks pipes i have hard times seeing the whole thing at once yeah that is uh that is just a general difficulty when when switching to uh when making the game in in first person right so we've had to do things that try to mitigate that right now the the easiest way that people um get around it is build towers or you know foundation towers or something like that so you can build from a higher vantage point um or using the uh maybe using the hover pack if you have other power you know lines or whatever around um but uh yeah so as for like a third person mode for building i don't think that's planned or i actually you know it's been it's been a long time there was a period where people asking about third person like every single week and we answered that question every week and we haven't it hasn't been asked for a long time so i don't actually know what the status of third person is i don't know if it's something that we're actually gonna do or not

> i feel like this is probably the decision before so i apologize repeat question but is there a possibility of altering the terrain in certain circumstances for example is there a way to make tunnels no so you can't really deform the terrain that's not really a thing that's possible now and i don't really see if that's going to be a thing in the future

> uh what does the object limit uh refer to exactly one constructor because one object so this is the the confusing thing with the object limit it refers to you object which is not like a physical object or a game object an unreal engine it's an unreal an engine object which is like way programming languages try to like obfuscate how memory works is by referring to massive object you may have heard the term like object oriented languages where they try to like simplify it but how you how you can think of of code um and it's it's essentially a memory object and no one constructor does not equal one object one constructor is could be many objects i don't know the exact number um and they also vary from object to object like maybe you know maybe a beacon is like three objects or maybe two objects or one i don't know exactly and then another constructor could be many objects so uh it's really hard to like to to to to know but something that we sort of tell folks is that like the the number of people that actually hit this object limit is so so few yes like you shouldn't have to worry about it there's unless you're really building some super crazy stuff you really really should not worry about it um and so like you shouldn't have to like don't don't let the object limit impact the way that you play the game unless or do if you want to but you shouldn't need to like you should see a better play as you normally want to yeah and you know we do things on our end to reduce the uh the overhead or the impact that uh objects have on the objective as well yeah so and also the amount of people that hit that object limit that are playing the game vanilla is even smaller uh most people that hit it are using mods to like build way faster and stuff like that and build like humongous things like place i'm thinking i'm talking like placing down like you know half a million foundation blocks and stuff like that um

> any place for player generated map i don't think there are any plans for that right now but we'll have to see what happens when we start working more with mod support um maybe maybe that's a thing that can be done so that uh modders can change up the map but right now i don't think there's any plan yeah it's kind of tricky with the map because like a lot of the map is baked so it's kind of hard to change it you'd have to like unload an entire tile and then reload like your version of it with the chain like if you want to make like a slight change to a tile or something you'd have to remove like the entire thing essentially uh it's kind of tricky with that stuff but we'll see if we can figure something out

> uh any thoughts about attaching splitters directly to machines such miners i mean i like the idea i don't know why we don't have that uh but yeah i'm not sure so say that again what was it i missed the any thoughts of attaching splitters directly to machine slash miners yes i was actually part of a lot of discussion in that regard in the early days this is the early days because i believe we changed our minds a little bit but one of the main reasons was because it wasn't clear enough what happened uh when you just attached a splitter to a machine it became like odd to like figure out what was going on there's also like a technical reason um where we need the the the belt sort of and if we wanted to do the thing where you can attach splitters to to factories we would need to like add like additional logic to the splitters and mergers and it made it like pretty ugly um so we just decided not to pursue that it's not impossible that we change our minds in the future and and make it so that you can attach them straight on because i believe there's an exception to conveyor lifts because they are technically a belt you can attach splitters directly on them i believe correct me if i'm wrong um but that's not but that's because it is a conveyor belt and it already has because the problem with with the also with this threading in the game is that when we update the threads in the game they're updated separately so belts are upgraded updated separately and then splitters and then factory buildings which would mean that the order of execution would be like a special case when a factory building could output directly to a splitter so we would like mess up that update order or something i'm not quite sure exactly how what was the issue there but that was one of the reasons too but it's not like an impossible thing to fix at some point but i don't think we are going to spend time on that because it's a lot of it's a lot of time for like maybe a little too little payout sort of so yeah you

> somebody asked if we've checked out unreal engine five we have checked that unreal engine five uh yeah it's it's cool we can't really say whether or not we're gonna be able to use it for satisfactory uh because the uh unreal engine five is not production already and it's still in like early access um and even though like nanite and lumen are very cool technology they also have limitations to them uh that makes it kind of hard to like at this point at least being able to say like yeah that's something that we definitely want to use in the future and uh who knows like once once they're actually done with unreal engine 5 maybe we will be done with satisfactory i don't know i don't know what the production plan is for unreal engine 5 currently um but yeah a lot of people have asked us about this of like yo yo nanite looks so cool you should use that in satisfactory and it's not that simple like just upgrading to that engine version might just cause so many issues for us that it's not worth it and it's it's like a discussion we have every single time when there's a new unreal engine version even the minor ones whether or not it's worth upgrading because it it creates a lot of issues um so it really has to like outweigh the benefits wait did i say that right the the benefits really have to outweigh the all the work and the issues that it causes because like we put so much work into the current systems and the way that we implemented stuff so it's like it's not maybe sometimes worth throwing that away just because there's a new cool guy in town or whatever um let's upgrade to unreal five forehead so we have checked it out though we are checking it out and we're all very interested in it but we can't see whether or not we're gonna be able to use it before satisfactory yet so stop asking about that nominating

<summary>A transcript is available</summary>

> can we use beds to sleep overnight um so this is something that i've talked to mark as well about uh no is the answer to that question for a few reasons uh the biggest reason is because it doesn't make any sense for our game which is like it has like idle mechanics to it you know where your factory lines will produce stuff overnight so if you were able to like sleep over the night then you just like be speeding up time since the nights are so short currently in the game you don't really gain much from doing that
>
> [Music]
>
> and it doesn't like a lot of people would always point this out in like as a solution to like why the nights are so dark but the problem isn't that like you need to sleep to get through the nights the problem is that the nights are too dark like we need to fix the lighting in the game and this is something that we're gonna do in fact this is something that we're working on soon ish i think um yeah because we broke the lighting in in update four because we updated the engine version so that's something that we're working on fairly soon i think um so we don't like that idea of beings of sleep through the night um and some people like yeah but it could just be cosmetic and sleep tonight but it's also we find that weird um so that's why we won't do that we'll do something with the beds i think because it feels kind of weird that we have like an empty hub and you can't really do anything in there um but it's not gonna be that you're gonna be able to like sleep through the night and now we have lights yeah exactly so what's the problem sleepers of the week no sleep is for a weekend

> uh can chainsaw use liquid in the future potentially we the reason why chainsaw only uses like solid biofuel up until now is because the that has that has made sense when you unlock or like rather when we intended to unlock the chainsaw and then further down the line it made sense like maybe to have other fuel and we haven't had that in the game because we haven't solved we haven't had support to like change fuels uh for the equipment and that's something that we're probably gonna do in the future i don't know exactly when that will happen um but that's why we haven't had in the game i'm pretty sure we're gonna have it at some point like turbo fuel and chainsaw or you know liquid biofuel which like what else do you use that for um so yeah

> any changes of the coloring system yes there's going to be some changes in the color system i don't know exactly what those changes are going to be that's something that is uh most likely going to change or one thing that i am i think is going to change maybe it will check my answer is like declining more and more um i think there's some issues with the coloring system that we've been putting off um such as not being to like paint vehicles and stuff like that so i think there's gonna be somewhat of an overhaul of the coloring system and the fact that we're like using srgb uh or not wait are we using linear rgb in the game or not i can't remember whatever the the color values in game aren't linear i think or they are linear wait which one is the common one hsl yeah yeah but that's not the thing i'm talking about right now because you can even if you if you if you're like in a uh if you're like on the internet you're like look up a color and you see like oh that's a nice color and you try to match it uh in the game it will still not be correct and that's because the in-game color picker is is using srgb which isn't a linear color space but most applications use color like linear color space even if you have the same hex it will not like match uh that's just because we picked one of them so we're probably gonna change that as well because i think a lot of people are confused by that uh i think a lot of people don't even realize it um and yeah we do we do use hl hsl in the color picker but that's not what i'm talking about right now um but that's something we probably will also change at some point this is like ui that probably is is like in the backlog of things uh we just haven't been prioritized well enough so we'll probably happen in alignment with the coloring system

> priority merger i guess is is priority merger the same thing as like ratios being able to set ratio splitting or is that something you guys think is something different or because i see people refer to this as two different things and i'm not sure if it's like actually two different things or you guys are talking about the same thing whenever people say priority merger it's different oh okay then uh qa site go tell us what you what you think or maybe explain it to me actually that might be good priority merger gives priority to a specific input it will always take from that input before taking from others yeah that's something that we probably will add um wait i don't know honestly i don't think that's something we've uh thought too much about because the ratio thing we definitely see the use case for the priority merger um

> people have been wondering if i play it on experimental and i have a save there will i still be loaded if i switch back to early access and yes you will you will the saves will will generally the saves will always load if you're playing on a newer or the same version of the game and you can see that if you check in like the left corner in the game there's like a version number there or a change list number rather cl if you will
>
> [Music]
>
> where uh it will tell you what version you're on and if you're playing on a similar version or a higher number then you can always load older saves it's the other way around where it's not possible because the game can't know in advance you know what's gonna be in the save structure and stuff like that sometimes we even change the save structure so and uh yeah so it's it's it's possible to load old saves but you can't load like newer version save files so your save files will load in early access if you played on experimental um it's possible that you might need to like move the save files around on disk it depends a little bit of how you've been playing uh the game if you've been on epic or if on steam and if you're playing offline and stuff like that um so if your save file doesn't show up in the list uh it's probably still in the uh save folder somewhere so just like move it around and it should be fine another thing that i have to point out

> so wind power mark when no
>
> [Laughter]

> um what is the what is the reasoning why we don't want to add wind wind power or solar power or stuff like that uh i think both of those have the problem where that you can effectively even if you make a system around it that kind of checks for uh certain restrictions that you can just build them everywhere of course they would still effectively be limitless in in this game i think uh and we don't really want that for power like you could just build a giant solar panel field and not have to worry about the power at all which kind of defeats the point of the power system where it's supposed to be a pain in your butt every now and then and you're supposed to want to fix it and make it all run smoothly and i feel that that those kind of power supplies would take away from it because they don't have enough limitations that we can effectively uh contain the balancing off gotcha remember we we also brought up like water turbines yeah i think those will be more in the realm of what the the geysers now do yeah and right now the guys have the issue where some people actually brought this up where they feel kind of what kind of they're super weak for when you get them the amount of power that you get from them uh so we might change it as well but for the yeah water turbines i would be more interested in them because you would have to place them potentially on fast flowing rivers or waterfalls which are a limited resource so to say in the world which is more interesting in my opinion because it kind of gets you around like you can't just pop them down anywhere you actually have to find a waterfall we get up a cliff to get to the waterfall place them there connecting to your factory i think it's a more interesting way to approach power with a bit of a challenge like that than just to give a building that just produces it out of thin air gotcha free power when do we get free power

> what's the feature you wanna add to this so i personally really wanna improve the build modes uh i there are there are a lot i think we talked about this last week as well there are a few um there are a few things that really annoy me when you're building and i think there are somewhat easy to fix and they will improve building immensely so i would love to to improve some of those things first and foremost and maybe like a global grid situation but also like how you place you know um mergers and splitters i think that's one of the like places mergers and splitters uh not the fact that they don't clip on foundations when you're dragging them i'm already placed um conveyor belts and stuff like that i think that's really annoying uh stuff like you know the what are they called the the pipe connector thingies i can't remember what they're called that they rotate too i think they rotate too freely i want them to be able to clip snap it a bit better the snapping system we have for the guidelines thing when the green lines show up when you hold control that's a prototype that's not done at all um that's a prototype i made and then we're like alright i just put in the game whatever it works pipe junction thank you uh i want i want better clipping and like snapping with that so if you're if you're one of those people that like builds very methodically it just makes it so much easier to build because i think the addition of the the hover pack makes things so much better in the game i think the hover pack is like one of the best items in the game right now um so improving the the build modes would make the game a ton better imo god i love the hover pack i know it's so good right

> object limit any chance to display how much is left somehow uh not really the the common misconception about the object limit is that people think that it's like the number of objects that are placed in the world but this is a memory thing so you know placing a foundation has a smaller object you object imprint in memory than placing a constructor has um and it's not simple to explain it because memory in programming is is very complex uh it's not just like a lot of people often like describe it as like it's a it's an array of of of um ones and zeros that's memory no that's not exactly how it works uh because they're there's like memory caches and and setups for how they're loaded and stuff like that but uh the system that handles all that has a limit in unreal engine and uh there's not much we can do about it uh we can optimize for it but there's always going to be a limit um and you can even load a save file that crashes due to the object limit you can you can sometimes load that save file and sometimes you can based on what's going on in the game at that point um so kind of hard to it's it's hard to explain we're optimizing for it um and maybe in the future it will be a bit better but there's all there'll always be like a limit to it

> march 16. we still have questions now you know why does it go to experimental first and basically it's because we want the early access branch to be stable basically that's our stable branch and we do everything we can to make sure that the you know with testing internally to make sure that the game is as stable as possible when we bring it to experimental but we can never really be sure you know there's only like 30 40 of us or something like that and there's a bajillion of you guys and the feedback and the crash reports and all that kind of stuff that we get from you guys in the community um is just on a level that we couldn't get ourselves when testing internally so we put it we always put this stuff out all of our updates out on experimental first we gather as much information and feedback from you guys as possible fix any bugs all that kind of stuff stabilize the game and then once it's stable we bring it over to early access and that's just kind of the procedure that we have you might be wondering then so like okay so when's it gonna be on

> soon as we can uh now you might be wondering okay well i'm on early access how do i get on get in on this experimental stuff you know i want i want to fly close to the sun i'm going to live life on the edge right i don't care if it's unstable i want update for the second it drops how do i get experimental i hear you say okay so everyone has access to experimental if you are on the epic version of the game in your epic library you actually will just have two versions of satisfactory there one's experimental one's early access download the experimental one and play if you're on steam and you want access to the experimental version you just find satisfactory in your steam library and you right click on it go to properties select betas there's a drop down box and then choose experimental from the drop down box and that's all it is the game will redownload the experimental version of the game one thing that you should be wary of is your save files whenever changing versions always back up your saves save files from early access to experimental are supported not necessarily the other way around and then also experimental is unstable so you never know what's gonna happen maybe you need to revert but then you can't and you've lost your save files now so back up your saves i'll leave the path to your save files in the description down below back them up before changing branches like that okay uh yeah so

> um so are you pack packing the update 4 to an engine upgrade um so yeah um the engine upgrade won't go to early access before update 4 comes to early access so we will keep the engine upgrade on experimental branch as update 4 drops and then we're going to keep working on that until we feel that they both work and the main reason for that is because we there were a few like things that got way better for some people with the engine upgrade but some larger factory lines and stuff like that didn't get better um they got worse um so and that's annoying we don't want to like push the upgrade that can result in some people playing in early access getting a worse experience we would rather fix those issues before we do that and we don't have time to do that before update 4 launches so that's why we're doing it this way

> does obscuring belts actually help with performance uh it kind of depends um we have tested it and you do get a little bit of gain i think um the thing you sacrifice when you obscure the items is like clarence uh sorry not clearance um clarence clarence like uh what's the word like the it becomes less clear what's going on like uh it's harder to play the game so while you gain a little bit of performance it makes the game a little bit harder to play so we've thought of like adding something for people that need it or want it or something like that where you can like optionally do it i don't know if that's when that's gonna happen or if it's gonna happen or if it's just like a prototyping thing we did and just feel like nah it wasn't good but we have tried that at least

> mass foundation creation um mark talked about this a while ago like before holiday vacation um where we oh maybe this was a video that jace put out but we talked about essentially that we are kind of considering you know doing some kind of um not blueprints but like some kind of similar system or or something that makes sense in our game we don't think that blueprints by like the way the blueprints are like implemented in other games like factorio we don't think that makes sense in our game but we are looking into you know some kind of similar system to that to make late game building more enjoyable as you as you may know we're still done not done with the game there's still a lot of stuff to do with it and a lot of people you know think it's tedious when you reach the end game to not be able to like you know mass build and stuff like that and we we take that into consideration uh part of the game part of what makes this game fun too is like there's two problems math mass building uh there's one where the object constraint limit with the engine that makes if if we enable more people to build bigger things then they're gonna run into that wall much quicker that's one problem the other problem is that um a lot of aspects as to what makes the game fun is the fact that you are you know this pioneer and you're hand selecting stuff and building stuff building up this everything by yourself and like these huge huge bases are really achievements from our players doing all that stuff and uh it's it's scary to remove that aspect of the game because that can really like optimize out the fun another game but we know that it's pretty tedious for a lot of people to do that stuff so we are looking into ways to improve it but i don't know right now what our intentions are um but when we hear you like it's it's not a it's not like a yeah we hear you guys uh and i can't mention i can mention somebody mentioned like the the mods that exist we have looked at the mods and we don't really like the solution um that mods have made um because we feel like like i said before it really optimized like the mods the way they are built right now they optimize out the fun out of the game for us um the way we perceive it and also like i know a lot of people gonna be like no but a lot of people download the mods but our core game player base do not download those mods um so it's it's a it's a shitty answer but uh yeah it's it's like there's always that case when you know we have our opinions of what we don't want to do with the game and what we think are best for the game and then you know you guys definitely have good suggestions too it's not that we're saying like our no our mega brains are we're much since like our mega brains have the right answers and like this is how a game is supposed to be uh every design decision affects a lot of the game and uh it's it's um it's really tricky it's really tricky so that's why we're a bit hesitant to just like throw in you know multi build modes and stuff like that so yeah

> right here uh now that you guys have a big boy obviously are you planning on hiring uh a lot more people to fill it out actually i think we just stopped hiring yeah um and so we got some extra people i i the plan is not to fill it out um if you grow it like growing a dev studio the bigger it gets the harder it is to do anything so you kind of want to get you need to find a really good balance between the number of people you have and what you're outputting and so so like just filling it out because we have the space and i suppose we probably may i don't know mate let's just say hypothetically we had the money for it as well is not automatically a good thing to do so um yeah but at this at this point point i don't really know what the plan is but from what i understand we're kind of done hiring for a little while yeah as far as i know too i think we uh the feeling i'll this is my take on it but it feels like coffee also has like more like a long-term thinking so we don't even if we could have like 60 people right now we wouldn't do it because it wouldn't make sense for us yeah

> you want to make a thing so you can do it um are there any green energy options in the game relative uh news of the game but cold feels bad uh so the thing with green energy is something we've thought about and something that we sort of toss up and oh i'm not sure what we want to do but i think we lean to not doing it but the option is still there and the reason the reason for doing it is because it i don't know it's kind of fun right but the reason to not do it is the point of the game is you work for a company that doesn't give a about the planet and your whole goal is to just exploit the planet at any cost spew carbon up into the air don't care destroy everything cut down every tree kill every creature mine up all the resources yeah um so that is the point of the game that is the story and lore so in order you know if you're gonna invest in green energy it lore wise it doesn't make much sense but if you balance that with fun then maybe it does make sense or maybe it will be a mod like i mean you know video games is escapism right like we we give you this option like you can go and and be as dirty as you want you can roll around in the mud and use coal as much as you go nuclear like do whatever you want and you guys are like no i want to be clean like which is honorable just don't build a factory and don't cut down trees yeah exactly yeah
