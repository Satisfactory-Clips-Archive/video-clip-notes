> dedicated servers we're still working on that dedicated service is problematic and has been since the start because of the client side issues um there's a lot of bugs on client that we sort of need to get around to and unfortunately a lot of issues on client might seem trivial but uh they have entailed that we have to like re rewrite a bunch of systems from multiplayer and do like client-side prediction which is a lot of work something that we we're kind of thinking of saving until later but now we're kind of realizing more and more as we get into it that uh we kind of need to do it now um so that's why dedicated service is taking so long but we are working on that still and it's not tied to any update it's just going to be like once the dedicated service is done we're just going to try and release it to everyone so that everyone try it out and and kind of beta test the data servers as well once that we're in a good state for that who all right yeah

> somebody asked if we've checked out unreal engine five we have checked that unreal engine five uh yeah it's it's cool we can't really say whether or not we're gonna be able to use it for satisfactory uh because the uh unreal engine five is not production already and it's still in like early access um and even though like nanite and lumen are very cool technology they also have limitations to them uh that makes it kind of hard to like at this point at least being able to say like yeah that's something that we definitely want to use in the future and uh who knows like once once they're actually done with unreal engine 5 maybe we will be done with satisfactory i don't know i don't know what the production plan is for unreal engine 5 currently um but yeah a lot of people have asked us about this of like yo yo nanite looks so cool you should use that in satisfactory and it's not that simple like just upgrading to that engine version might just cause so many issues for us that it's not worth it and it's it's like a discussion we have every single time when there's a new unreal engine version even the minor ones whether or not it's worth upgrading because it it creates a lot of issues um so it really has to like outweigh the benefits wait did i say that right the the benefits really have to outweigh the all the work and the issues that it causes because like we put so much work into the current systems and the way that we implemented stuff so it's like it's not maybe sometimes worth throwing that away just because there's a new cool guy in town or whatever um let's upgrade to unreal five forehead so we have checked it out though we are checking it out and we're all very interested in it but we can't see whether or not we're gonna be able to use it before satisfactory yet so stop asking about that nominating

> so yeah what about story so we've been i think there's been like uh like story development uh is like is actually underway yeah i'm pretty sure we can actually talk a little about that we are prototyping how to like we have so hannah our lead writer she's made a story for the game and and she's had like a story in her mind for a long time but now she's like actually like put it down on paper she's gone through like the the everything and we have like a sort of uh how the story will play out what we're trying to figure out currently is how like the story is told in the game uh and that's something that we're prototyping currently like but the thing is you guys won't see any of that until 1.0 because we are not planning on releasing any of that stuff until the game is finished food court exactly that's that's all you need to know we really shouldn't have spoiled the food court in the early days yeah but we haven't talked about it in a while so glad you brought it up so that people get reminded by it

<details>

<summary>A transcript is available</summary>

> there any plans to bring things like solar power and electric vehicles to the game i mean um i can't remember what the latest is on like green energy but uh we had thought about it a lot and i'm pretty sure we're not doing it yes mark talked about this this has been a while actually now but mark mark pretty pretty much like put down the foot when it comes to this discussion uh where so so i'm gonna do a real quick tldr for everyone that's like wishing for green energy and stuff like that so wind power and solar power are two things that we've already prototyped in the game very early on and there were two power options that we didn't like because they don't give you any interesting choices with the game with all power generators currently in the game there's always like a trade-off and there's always like a choice you make when you set it up so like with coal it's like the water and all the hassle with that and with like the fuel it's like the whole fuel production and how you balance that and then the nuclear where you make the trade off with the waste and then to extend on that you have the plutonium waste where like you have to trade off like do you want to make plutonian fuel rods you can sync them or do you want to use them as power blah blah there's always like a ton of different um trade-offs and decisions you have to make with all uh power generators in the game including the geothermal one where it doesn't give you a it fluctuates right so that's one thing we don't like about solar panel and and and winds and stuff like that and i already know what people are going to be like yeah but what if the solar panels get dirty and stuff like that that's also annoying because that adds like mechanics to the game where you have to like maintain your factory and that is super annoying that's something that we definitely don't want and also really random if we only apply it to to wind turbines you know what i mean like yeah but any other building could could get dirty or break down you know like why doesn't this apply to everything exactly um but the but the bigger problem is really that this is like an infinite builder game where like you can pretty much build however many you want and if you can build like an infinite amount of solar arrays that means you just get free power and that's also not something we think is a good idea with the game with the way it's set up right now but one thing that mark has been a little bit curious about and i'm not saying that we're going to do it because it's still i don't think we're actually gonna do it to be honest uh but one thing that mark was found a little bit interesting was water like turbines because there's a limited amount of of like waterfalls where you would be able to set these up so that's something that mark was like curious about but we don't really know if we're actually gonna do that or not um so that's the only like if if anything i mean the game is still in early access so you can never say never but i don't think we're gonna do it uh because i feel like we would have done that already if we wanted it but those that feels feels kind of unnecessary like like even with the waterfalls thing it's it's kind of just like the waterfalls are essentially a node then right and so what's the difference really between that and a geothermal right exactly you know what i mean and we're not happy with how the geothermal work either like right now so like i i don't know but that's essentially the tldr on that situation um there's one more thing i wanted to say about that i completely forgot cool but that's that's that's that's the tl they are we definitely won't add solar panel and wind um and we're very doubtful about water turbines but just for arguments there there are scotland saying power seems fairly complete at this point i you know there are some things that i know that we've talked about with power which i'm not going to mention now because i don't think we've ever mentioned it um but there are some things about power that could still be changed or reworked actually um that that could potentially make the game better or more interesting yes um and simply just like adding a new like power type like green energy or something like that uh is is there there's more ways to make things interesting than just throwing more things at it you know what i mean yes um again it's when you when you just if you're just adding something it's it's going back to just moving the goal post right like if we added hydro then people will add their hydro things in and then be like but yeah we want something else now right so that's why like simply just adding things adding more like like meat to the game doesn't necessarily uh really translate to a lot more gameplay um but but i will say this though because we we talked about this as well in the past uh when on on the topic of like powers feels complete uh like jace mentioned like you still early access like anything can happen but we feel i think we're already in a we are in a pretty good spot with power like we're pretty happy with most things power related uh update four was actually originally gonna be all about power like update 4 was originally supposed to be about you know power changes and like more dynamics to the power and like having you know uh like distance fall off and stuff like that and then we prototyped it and we felt like it's it's not really adding much to the game like it it's making things more complex but powers is a thing that comes in so early in the game um and it feels like it doesn't feel good to make it complex so early on in the game um so a lot of ideas we had for update 4 were scrapped because we just didn't feel like like eugene mentioned like adding on top of it it just doesn't add that much honestly uh solar solar is interesting because it's on during the day only uh so the the problem with that is i think it's 45 minutes day time five minutes night time yes so that means your solar power won't be working only 10 of the time yes which is honestly negligible if the game was like 50 50 or 60 40 or something like that uh i could that that could make you know a lot of sense i think um it would add more i think but with just that with with it just being like 10 percent of your game time being nighttime it doesn't really make much sense exactly so uh how you doing doing good

> one train update we don't know um something i feel like when i read on the steam forum sometimes about this uh there's a little bit of mis information maybe about about the trains in satisfactory um the trains are in early access sort of if that makes sense like when we released the train update we weren't happy with the trains fully and we even announced at that point that we were gonna like work more on trains at some point in the future this is also haven't had that pass yet yeah exactly uh this is also why this like a lot of the multiplayer bugs that you may have faced uh have been tied to trains and it's because like when we run into an issue sometimes it's worth doing like a sort of workaround solution and sometimes it's like ah it's better to save this when we actually rework the entire system and that's been the case for a lot of train issues where we know that we're gonna rework trains at some point we just don't know when so it's like not been totally worth it to like in invest a lot of time in fixing issues if we if we notice that like the issue we're trying to solve actually doesn't just like you know it's actually a lot of work to fix it um but we are going to improve trains at some point in the future that's that's we've we've decided that and what we really want to shoot for is like having some kind of signaling system or some kind of collisioning system or both uh i don't know exactly what's been decided yeah i think we've said in the past that we won both i'm pretty sure i'm also pretty sure that that's still the plan but yeah yeah so so trains are gonna get an update at some point in the future yeah um just so you guys know i've seen some people say that we're not going to do updates to the trains but we are going to do some changes to the trains and that also means that just a fyi for people that have built train tracks um when we do implement that uh similar to how we've done with other things we've changed in the game like if you set up certain train systems where adding a signaling system or a collision system on top of that wouldn't make sense then your break your your train lines are probably going to break so the recommendation i have currently without actually knowing what we're gonna do is to not have all your train lines on one single track and going back and forth i guess that's that's the only thing i think like following the the same path that like factorio does with like their multi where you kind of need like two directions with your train lines and tracks i think you're safe in those situations but i don't know that's just uh my gut feeling um

> steam workshop question mark don't know uh we have to see when we start uh doing like official mod support and how we wish to tackle that um steam workshop can make sense uh but it also doesn't make sense in some ways because we sell the game on multiple platforms right now it's epic and steam but you know maybe in the future we want to sell it on other platforms as well and we don't want people who bought the game on epic or non-steam platforms to not have access to mods right so we would like us some kind of solution that everyone can use um to access mods and so if we only have steam workshop then that won't make sense um so that could mean that it makes no sense to support steam workshop at all because then it creates a lot of work for modders who then are either need to create mods to support on different platforms or um they might end up only doing steam workshop and then everyone else misses out again so that kind of sucks so it's kind of a weird situation um but right now the way that the mods work that the unofficial modding community has done it works really well it's very easy so if you go to oh my god i'm blanking on the site what's it called physical.yeah.com.org wait fixit.app that's the one i think it's fixit.app yeah yes yes and i've got the um the mod manager modloader manager um there and it's super easy to just like um just enable a mod and then start the game so uh yep pretty pretty good solution at the moment

> these teleporters i remember when we had teleporters back in the day like before the game was out and we were like we had prototype teleporters we didn't really have them in but the uh designers just uh prototype teleporters it helped me solve a crash bug in the vehicles i've told that story yeah i think i've told us i think you can tell it again because you have to tell it again it's been a while right yeah yeah so like we had these we had these teleporters and there was this test map that i would work on and um one day i made a change to vehicles lo and behold there was like a crowd they were causing a crash and we didn't know what the hell was going on um and uh wait how did this work yeah so so uh i was like okay so what's happening so simon showed me the simon who found it and if he parked uh like an explorer on this one ramp on this level and like and then got out the explorer would just disappear and reappear somewhere else on the map but if you stayed in the explorer the game would crash and the crash logs would look at like what's crashing and it was like a berry it was crashing in a berry or something like that we're like what the hell is going on why is it berry crashing when the the vehicle disappears and um so what what ended up uh solving it was like sometimes it would crash at this berry other times it would um it wouldn't crash but the vehicle would drive out of a teleporter and we're like why is this happening and you know why is it when i parked the vehicle it comes out of the teleporter and what happened was there was like a divide by zero error in the um in the vehicle and so in a very specific case which happened if you parked on this one ramp the physics in the vehicle would divide by zero and infinite forces would be applied to the to the vehicle and so the the hitbox of the vehicle expanded to infinity within a frame and occasionally that hitbox then overlapped with one of the teleporters which reset the physics in the vehicle positioned it to the other teleporter and then it would just drive out of the teleporter so that's kind of how that was happening and and that's how i figured that out so uh i just have to go and fix that divide by zero and then everything was fine again but yeah thanks teleporter and then sometimes it would crash on the um the uh the berry thing because like the hitbox would would collide with the berry first and then the physics object would like die or some [ __ ] and yeah it was really weird it was a really weird thing so uh yeah i had uh thanks teleporter what what a nice way to like fail graciously just having it be like yeah i was like why does it drive out of the the teleporters it's so weird oh it's so funny though yeah

> i'm gonna say uh what's the current multiplayer status it's it's all right it's going it's going places it's all right i'll give it a solid six out of ten seven out of ten ten we're working i'm out ten on a good day yeah i saw a similar question about like if there's any big optimization uh updates coming like the the the tricky thing is like we've kind of like um i mentioned this before we are reworking a bunch of systems for the games to be able to like both because of technical depth and we're like we need to fix them to be able to work on other things but also to like so that we can actually do major improvements to the game it's a slow it's a marathon like it takes time we don't have any like obvious low hanging fruit and we haven't had that for a long time actually so like sometimes we figure out things in the game that we didn't know about for instance one thing that ben talked about in the um in the uh lights video was that we we noticed that the dismantle effect uh would cache kind of all the materials for all buildings in the game on like in one frame and then throw it away when you load it into the game and that wasn't something that we we realized until after we implemented the stencil drawing of the mantle effect but that was a huge gain for for like big factories and we didn't know about that so there's still a bunch of stuff we can do to improve on things like that but for the most part it's like we have like a bunch of systems that we need to build so that we can get a little bit of better performance here and there but you know all that stuff kind of trickles down and eventually you'll get a much smoother experience but it really is a marathon and there's no like one one thing to fix to fix all things um so slow and steady wins the race essentially if you go back to a bunch of builds of the game and look at play the game like you will definitely notice how much worse it was before um like i remember i remember bef when we released the ea e3 trailer um there was a factory that we we filmed in like slow motion so that we kind of like because we couldn't run that factory on the machine that we had at that time and then now that that factory is like nothing like compared to what people are running now so like there's definitely improvement to the game uh when it comes to performance and we have the receipts for that um so it's just uh it's just uh we just have to keep going so you're gonna see slow improvements but it's probably you won't probably like it also depends a little bit on your situations like sometimes people have had a factory setup that like is hugely affected by some optimization uh but for most people you probably won't notice until uh unless you go back

> uh is there technical reason because you only made mk5 belts and no higher uh there is a technical reason for uh why they don't go higher but there also might be a design reason for it not to be first to not be mk6 but there is there is definitely also a technical reason which you know may or may not be solvable but it becomes really hard to sort of uh at a certain point to calculate how many units can travel along the belt pass through um merges and splitters and stuff like that uh it actually actually becomes a very tricky problem like i remember quite a few years ago when the programmer at the time who was working on those belts he was obsessed with splitters and mergers for like a couple weeks straight and it was it was and i'm you know i was like you know what's what's the problem he would talk to me about it and it was actually really complicated yeah it usually is like you don't really think about when you just see like the result or like the black box or something you don't really realize like how much work goes in every because every that's the same thing every time i recently actually talked to uh one of the programmers that have been working on splitters a little bit recently and i was like hey why can't we just do this thing and he was like well you got a moment you want to sit down and they told me like all like the weird edge cases that can happen and like why why it's it's it is the way it is um so yeah it's it's complicated you guys um but also to follow up like a question i got a lot too is is the mark iii minor with like how you can't get currently in the game you can't get the full output from them if you overclock them and that's something that we're gonna uh touch upon later down the line we don't know for sure if like jace mentioned if like we're gonna solve the technical issue that's that's the reason why we can't do that currently or if we're gonna like have to rebalance all the belts in the game to match like what the highest speed we currently have you know uh and then make that the the maximum and that's kind of what we did with pipes for a while too where we know for we know for a fact we won't be able to go over 600 cubic meters per per minute we we are already kind of like does it actually work fully like i don't know it's a bit like we're kind of testing it still uh and at some point maybe we'll change that and just make it so that you know 600 is yeah still the maximum but there might be like some lower value to it that some machines use or something like that so there might be some rebalance there uh but in those three balances i'm pretty sure that it won't really affect every anyone that much it will just make like all your things offset a little bit in your recipes and then uh like if it worked before it will still work in those cases it's not like the rebalancing of recipe stuff um is my understanding of it when they explain it to me but totally explicit with the big brain here yeah let me just add a second output bam bam bam well bam so actually they've told me no that's not an easy solution either apparently oh really because of race conditions that can happen with the belts so there's it's already an issue with the com like the storage containers that can have one and two outputs it's already a problem there so that's why they don't want to do that either nice yet at least maybe they solve it

> can we use beds to sleep overnight um so this is something that i've talked to mark as well about uh no is the answer to that question for a few reasons uh the biggest reason is because it doesn't make any sense for our game which is like it has like idle mechanics to it you know where your factory lines will produce stuff overnight so if you were able to like sleep over the night then you just like be speeding up time since the nights are so short currently in the game you don't really gain much from doing that
>
> [Music]
>
> and it doesn't like a lot of people would always point this out in like as a solution to like why the nights are so dark but the problem isn't that like you need to sleep to get through the nights the problem is that the nights are too dark like we need to fix the lighting in the game and this is something that we're gonna do in fact this is something that we're working on soon ish i think um yeah because we broke the lighting in in update four because we updated the engine version so that's something that we're working on fairly soon i think um so we don't like that idea of beings of sleep through the night um and some people like yeah but it could just be cosmetic and sleep tonight but it's also we find that weird um so that's why we won't do that we'll do something with the beds i think because it feels kind of weird that we have like an empty hub and you can't really do anything in there um but it's not gonna be that you're gonna be able to like sleep through the night and now we have lights yeah exactly so what's the problem sleepers of the week no sleep is for a weekend

> i can already confirm that mark ii constructors and stuff like that is not going to happen uh because that it's too much work uh making new uh machines for that so if we make like a mark ii constructor and a mark ii assembler and stuff like that we would want to make like new you know visuals for those and and add them to the game and this is too much work for our artists um so that's something that we already confirmed that's not gonna happen but i don't know why i pointed that out because i saw that in in chat

> uh can chainsaw use liquid in the future potentially we the reason why chainsaw only uses like solid biofuel up until now is because the that has that has made sense when you unlock or like rather when we intended to unlock the chainsaw and then further down the line it made sense like maybe to have other fuel and we haven't had that in the game because we haven't solved we haven't had support to like change fuels uh for the equipment and that's something that we're probably gonna do in the future i don't know exactly when that will happen um but that's why we haven't had in the game i'm pretty sure we're gonna have it at some point like turbo fuel and chainsaw or you know liquid biofuel which like what else do you use that for um so yeah

> any changes of the coloring system yes there's going to be some changes in the color system i don't know exactly what those changes are going to be that's something that is uh most likely going to change or one thing that i am i think is going to change maybe it will check my answer is like declining more and more um i think there's some issues with the coloring system that we've been putting off um such as not being to like paint vehicles and stuff like that so i think there's gonna be somewhat of an overhaul of the coloring system and the fact that we're like using srgb uh or not wait are we using linear rgb in the game or not i can't remember whatever the the color values in game aren't linear i think or they are linear wait which one is the common one hsl yeah yeah but that's not the thing i'm talking about right now because you can even if you if you if you're like in a uh if you're like on the internet you're like look up a color and you see like oh that's a nice color and you try to match it uh in the game it will still not be correct and that's because the in-game color picker is is using srgb which isn't a linear color space but most applications use color like linear color space even if you have the same hex it will not like match uh that's just because we picked one of them so we're probably gonna change that as well because i think a lot of people are confused by that uh i think a lot of people don't even realize it um and yeah we do we do use hl hsl in the color picker but that's not what i'm talking about right now um but that's something we probably will also change at some point this is like ui that probably is is like in the backlog of things uh we just haven't been prioritized well enough so we'll probably happen in alignment with the coloring system

> priority merger i guess is is priority merger the same thing as like ratios being able to set ratio splitting or is that something you guys think is something different or because i see people refer to this as two different things and i'm not sure if it's like actually two different things or you guys are talking about the same thing whenever people say priority merger it's different oh okay then uh qa site go tell us what you what you think or maybe explain it to me actually that might be good priority merger gives priority to a specific input it will always take from that input before taking from others yeah that's something that we probably will add um wait i don't know honestly i don't think that's something we've uh thought too much about because the ratio thing we definitely see the use case for the priority merger um

> but at least i don't understand the difference between having the overflow option i need to re-knit this or maybe didn't talk to someone else so i think this is too hard to grasp but i hear you i hear okay um it's an oh it's not a merger yeah that's true okay cool cool cool that's true all right good to know uh if there's not a ticket for this on the qa site uh upvote it sorry if there's a ticket on this upload it and if there's not create one great snippet

> what's with the the bug with the gas mask of the truck this is this is the bug that's been in the game for forever we're gonna fix that eventually and like you know some bugs are kind of like we look at a system for instance the body slot which this is ties into we look at the body slot issue we're like okay this is a this is a big issue that a lot of bugs are related to uh so it's the equipment system so we're like all right we need to rework the equipment system um to be able to solve the body slots and when we do that that's when we can solve the gas mask thing because then we're redoing it so that's why we've been putting it off because it's a huge system and that bug is part of that

> so wind power mark when no
>
> [Laughter]

> um what is the what is the reasoning why we don't want to add wind wind power or solar power or stuff like that uh i think both of those have the problem where that you can effectively even if you make a system around it that kind of checks for uh certain restrictions that you can just build them everywhere of course they would still effectively be limitless in in this game i think uh and we don't really want that for power like you could just build a giant solar panel field and not have to worry about the power at all which kind of defeats the point of the power system where it's supposed to be a pain in your butt every now and then and you're supposed to want to fix it and make it all run smoothly and i feel that that those kind of power supplies would take away from it because they don't have enough limitations that we can effectively uh contain the balancing off gotcha remember we we also brought up like water turbines yeah i think those will be more in the realm of what the the geysers now do yeah and right now the guys have the issue where some people actually brought this up where they feel kind of what kind of they're super weak for when you get them the amount of power that you get from them uh so we might change it as well but for the yeah water turbines i would be more interested in them because you would have to place them potentially on fast flowing rivers or waterfalls which are a limited resource so to say in the world which is more interesting in my opinion because it kind of gets you around like you can't just pop them down anywhere you actually have to find a waterfall we get up a cliff to get to the waterfall place them there connecting to your factory i think it's a more interesting way to approach power with a bit of a challenge like that than just to give a building that just produces it out of thin air gotcha free power when do we get free power

> um mass building like the smart mod i don't know what we've decided we keep going back and forth on this um yeah i can't i can't really say too much because we haven't decided anything yet we do want to make some i think the way we it's going to go down is first we're going to work on the the improvements to building stuff and we get that out of the way and then we take that feedback that we get from that and see if it's still an issue and stuff like that and then we build upon that because it's kind of hard to when we know that we're working on on improvements to the game in some aspect it's hard to know we want to like close in on those things before we move on to some other problem because sometimes when we introduce a new thing it can cause other problems or it can solve things and it's unnecessary to start working on stuff like that um until we've tried something else so we're gonna introduce some better build modes and stuff like that um in a coming update and then we'll take it from there

> what's the feature you wanna add to this so i personally really wanna improve the build modes uh i there are there are a lot i think we talked about this last week as well there are a few um there are a few things that really annoy me when you're building and i think there are somewhat easy to fix and they will improve building immensely so i would love to to improve some of those things first and foremost and maybe like a global grid situation but also like how you place you know um mergers and splitters i think that's one of the like places mergers and splitters uh not the fact that they don't clip on foundations when you're dragging them i'm already placed um conveyor belts and stuff like that i think that's really annoying uh stuff like you know the what are they called the the pipe connector thingies i can't remember what they're called that they rotate too i think they rotate too freely i want them to be able to clip snap it a bit better the snapping system we have for the guidelines thing when the green lines show up when you hold control that's a prototype that's not done at all um that's a prototype i made and then we're like alright i just put in the game whatever it works pipe junction thank you uh i want i want better clipping and like snapping with that so if you're if you're one of those people that like builds very methodically it just makes it so much easier to build because i think the addition of the the hover pack makes things so much better in the game i think the hover pack is like one of the best items in the game right now um so improving the the build modes would make the game a ton better imo god i love the hover pack i know it's so good right

> um any mods you want to add to vanilla at some stage i'm sure there are mods that i'm sure there are things that we already thought about that there's a mod for currently um and um look guys like we worked in this game for a long time and uh we've had the opportunity to think about this game a lot so drones for instance was something that we've like thought about before we we released this game okay uh and it's been our like backlog since then um and and and obviously when when there's a mod for something that we've like thought about but not like released that's a good sign that like this is probably good feature to implement um so uh so yeah that be like it do lights is another thing lights was actually implemented in the game uh before it was it was out if you remember the stream me and jace did where we played the old version of the game that had lights that version had lights so it's been in the game since then and and at that point lights weren't that good for the game they didn't run that well um and that's why we didn't release the game with lights uh but now we're at the point where we feel confident with our solution for lights there's still i think a little bit tweaking left to do with the lights but we as far as i know i it looks pretty good and they work pretty well um also saw the street lights and the alpha screenshots yeah and i think i think people also data mined like the uh the lights out of the game uh so you know this was coming okay and we knew it was coming and it's it's here now so good times were had by all

> well you had arachnophobia mode that isn't actually scarier than spiders um no the cats aren't that scary you guys the spiders are the arachnophobia mode is in the game because there's a person at coffee stain or used to or whatever uh that had arachnophobia uh that's something to say yeah however uh so they couldn't work on the game um that's why we added it there's there's a difference between irrational fear of something and something being scary or scarier than something else that's why rectophobia mode is the way it is we don't want to remove the the scary factor from spiders we still want them to be a scary part of the game but when you have an irrational fear of something that's a different thing cataphobia

> how will update 4 changes the lower level lines like motors heavy frames etc so the update 4 will not change anything below tier 7. um so all the previous stuff will be the same pretty much there's going to be some things that unlock in earlier uh tiers uh but we won't change anything like we the thing that we announced is that like in tier seven there's some production uh line changes that breaks your save files currently if you already have like production going for your bauxite and your aluminium and uh battery production i think are the ones so those will change but the previous ones will be unaffected as far as i know

> hey everyone my name is jason i'm the community manager coffee stay in studios and today i don't have any cool like content or teasers or or anything like that no leaks but i do have information uh we have a release date for update four on experimental uh previously we had said maybe march 9th maybe march 16th uh can confirm now that march 16th is the date that we're going for we're really short 99 sure that we can hit march 16th you never know with gamedev something crazy might happen and maybe there'll be a delay but we're pretty certain that we're good for march 16. we still have questions now you know why does it go to experimental first and basically it's because we want the early access branch to be stable basically that's our stable branch and we do everything we can to make sure that the you know with testing internally to make sure that the game is as stable as possible when we bring it to experimental but we can never really be sure you know there's only like 30 40 of us or something like that and there's a bajillion of you guys and the feedback and the crash reports and all that kind of stuff that we get from you guys in the community um is just on a level that we couldn't get ourselves when testing internally so we put it we always put this stuff out all of our updates out on experimental first we gather as much information and feedback from you guys as possible fix any bugs all that kind of stuff stabilize the game and then once it's stable we bring it over to early access and that's just kind of the procedure that we have you might be wondering then so like okay so when's it gonna be on early access then don't know uh that completely depends on the feedback we get from you guys right but we kind of have a rough plan and our rough plan is we want to be on experimental for maybe about a month it'll take to stabilize it is our guess but this completely depends on like i said what information we get from you guys so take that date with a grain of salt you know it could be a month after that it could be two months after that if things really aren't going well um but we'll get it over to early access as soon as we can uh now you might be wondering okay well i'm on early access how do i get on get in on this experimental stuff you know i want i want to fly close to the sun i'm going to live life on the edge right i don't care if it's unstable i want update for the second it drops how do i get experimental i hear you say okay so everyone has access to experimental if you are on the epic version of the game in your epic library you actually will just have two versions of satisfactory there one's experimental one's early access download the experimental one and play if you're on steam and you want access to the experimental version you just find satisfactory in your steam library and you right click on it go to properties select betas there's a drop down box and then choose experimental from the drop down box and that's all it is the game will redownload the experimental version of the game one thing that you should be wary of is your save files whenever changing versions always back up your saves save files from early access to experimental are supported not necessarily the other way around and then also experimental is unstable so you never know what's gonna happen maybe you need to revert but then you can't and you've lost your save files now so back up your saves i'll leave the path to your save files in the description down below back them up before changing branches like that okay uh yeah so that's it you know when it's coming too experimental you kind of know when maybe it's coming to early access you now know how to get experimental if you didn't already and uh yeah update four come in march 16th we will also do a big stream so we stream every week at twitch.tv coffeestandstudiosdevs and we will do a special stream on march 16th for the release of update 4 if you want to hang out with us at that time so thank you all so much for watching this video i know it was just a lot of talking a lot of information but i hope you found it interesting and useful and i hope you have a lovely weekend this weekend take care everybody

> hey everyone my name is jason i'm the community manager coffee stay in studios and today i don't have any cool like content or teasers or or anything like that no leaks but i do have information uh we have a release date for update four on experimental uh previously we had said maybe march 9th maybe march 16th uh can confirm now that march 16th is the date that we're going for we're really short 99 sure that we can hit march 16th you never know with gamedev something crazy might happen and maybe there'll be a delay but we're pretty certain that we're good for march 16. we still have questions now you know why does it go to experimental first and basically it's because we want the early access branch to be stable basically that's our stable branch and we do everything we can to make sure that the you know with testing internally to make sure that the game is as stable as possible when we bring it to experimental but we can never really be sure you know there's only like 30 40 of us or something like that and there's a bajillion of you guys and the feedback and the crash reports and all that kind of stuff that we get from you guys in the community um is just on a level that we couldn't get ourselves when testing internally so we put it we always put this stuff out all of our updates out on experimental first we gather as much information and feedback from you guys as possible fix any bugs all that kind of stuff stabilize the game and then once it's stable we bring it over to early access and that's just kind of the procedure that we have you might be wondering then so like okay so when's it gonna be on early access then don't know uh that completely depends on the feedback we get from you guys right but we kind of have a rough plan and our rough plan is we want to be on experimental for maybe about a month it'll take to stabilize it is our guess but this completely depends on like i said what information we get from you guys so take that date with a grain of salt you know it could be a month after that it could be two months after that if things really aren't going well um but we'll get it over to early access as soon as we can uh now you might be wondering okay well i'm on early access how do i get on get in on this experimental stuff you know i want i want to fly close to the sun i'm going to live life on the edge right i don't care if it's unstable i want update for the second it drops how do i get experimental i hear you say okay so everyone has access to experimental if you are on the epic version of the game in your epic library you actually will just have two versions of satisfactory there one's experimental one's early access download the experimental one and play if you're on steam and you want access to the experimental version you just find satisfactory in your steam library and you right click on it go to properties select betas there's a drop down box and then choose experimental from the drop down box and that's all it is the game will redownload the experimental version of the game one thing that you should be wary of is your save files whenever changing versions always back up your saves save files from early access to experimental are supported not necessarily the other way around and then also experimental is unstable so you never know what's gonna happen maybe you need to revert but then you can't and you've lost your save files now so back up your saves i'll leave the path to your save files in the description down below back them up before changing branches like that okay uh yeah so that's it you know when it's coming too experimental you kind of know when maybe it's coming to early access you now know how to get experimental if you didn't already and uh yeah update four come in march 16th we will also do a big stream so we stream every week at twitch.tv coffeestandstudiosdevs and we will do a special stream on march 16th for the release of update 4 if you want to hang out with us at that time so thank you all so much for watching this video i know it was just a lot of talking a lot of information but i hope you found it interesting and useful and i hope you have a lovely weekend this weekend take care everybody

> um so are you pack packing the update 4 to an engine upgrade um so yeah um the engine upgrade won't go to early access before update 4 comes to early access so we will keep the engine upgrade on experimental branch as update 4 drops and then we're going to keep working on that until we feel that they both work and the main reason for that is because we there were a few like things that got way better for some people with the engine upgrade but some larger factory lines and stuff like that didn't get better um they got worse um so and that's annoying we don't want to like push the upgrade that can result in some people playing in early access getting a worse experience we would rather fix those issues before we do that and we don't have time to do that before update 4 launches so that's why we're doing it this way

> does obscuring belts actually help with performance uh it kind of depends um we have tested it and you do get a little bit of gain i think um the thing you sacrifice when you obscure the items is like clarence uh sorry not clearance um clarence clarence like uh what's the word like the it becomes less clear what's going on like uh it's harder to play the game so while you gain a little bit of performance it makes the game a little bit harder to play so we've thought of like adding something for people that need it or want it or something like that where you can like optionally do it i don't know if that's when that's gonna happen or if it's gonna happen or if it's just like a prototyping thing we did and just feel like nah it wasn't good but we have tried that at least

> mass foundation creation um mark talked about this a while ago like before holiday vacation um where we oh maybe this was a video that jace put out but we talked about essentially that we are kind of considering you know doing some kind of um not blueprints but like some kind of similar system or or something that makes sense in our game we don't think that blueprints by like the way the blueprints are like implemented in other games like factorio we don't think that makes sense in our game but we are looking into you know some kind of similar system to that to make late game building more enjoyable as you as you may know we're still done not done with the game there's still a lot of stuff to do with it and a lot of people you know think it's tedious when you reach the end game to not be able to like you know mass build and stuff like that and we we take that into consideration uh part of the game part of what makes this game fun too is like there's two problems math mass building uh there's one where the object constraint limit with the engine that makes if if we enable more people to build bigger things then they're gonna run into that wall much quicker that's one problem the other problem is that um a lot of aspects as to what makes the game fun is the fact that you are you know this pioneer and you're hand selecting stuff and building stuff building up this everything by yourself and like these huge huge bases are really achievements from our players doing all that stuff and uh it's it's scary to remove that aspect of the game because that can really like optimize out the fun another game but we know that it's pretty tedious for a lot of people to do that stuff so we are looking into ways to improve it but i don't know right now what our intentions are um but when we hear you like it's it's not a it's not like a yeah we hear you guys uh and i can't mention i can mention somebody mentioned like the the mods that exist we have looked at the mods and we don't really like the solution um that mods have made um because we feel like like i said before it really optimized like the mods the way they are built right now they optimize out the fun out of the game for us um the way we perceive it and also like i know a lot of people gonna be like no but a lot of people download the mods but our core game player base do not download those mods um so it's it's a it's a shitty answer but uh yeah it's it's like there's always that case when you know we have our opinions of what we don't want to do with the game and what we think are best for the game and then you know you guys definitely have good suggestions too it's not that we're saying like our no our mega brains are we're much since like our mega brains have the right answers and like this is how a game is supposed to be uh every design decision affects a lot of the game and uh it's it's um it's really tricky it's really tricky so that's why we're a bit hesitant to just like throw in you know multi build modes and stuff like that so yeah

> here oh boy cpu multicore the game is already multicore um we can probably improve it a little bit but to my knowledge that there's a the way the game is made it makes it really difficult to like make it more multi-threaded than it already is yeah i think there are some changes coming in the if i remember correctly based on the engine upgrade video which i'll share one more time i think i think there's going to be something that will improve it a bit um but isn't there the instancing can be yeah i think that will actually improve some yeah but that's for that will make rendering better or is that i think it was cpu because i think it had something to do with the conveyor uh oh it might be the driver or something or multi i don't remember no something else okay so check that video out yeah here's the engine upgrade video i think there was something about that in here oh no i put the time stamped one just don't go oh no don't look at it in 14 seconds embarrassing

> right here uh now that you guys have a big boy obviously are you planning on hiring uh a lot more people to fill it out actually i think we just stopped hiring yeah um and so we got some extra people i i the plan is not to fill it out um if you grow it like growing a dev studio the bigger it gets the harder it is to do anything so you kind of want to get you need to find a really good balance between the number of people you have and what you're outputting and so so like just filling it out because we have the space and i suppose we probably may i don't know mate let's just say hypothetically we had the money for it as well is not automatically a good thing to do so um yeah but at this at this point point i don't really know what the plan is but from what i understand we're kind of done hiring for a little while yeah as far as i know too i think we uh the feeling i'll this is my take on it but it feels like coffee also has like more like a long-term thinking so we don't even if we could have like 60 people right now we wouldn't do it because it wouldn't make sense for us yeah

> you want to make a thing so you can do it um are there any green energy options in the game relative uh news of the game but cold feels bad uh so the thing with green energy is something we've thought about and something that we sort of toss up and oh i'm not sure what we want to do but i think we lean to not doing it but the option is still there and the reason the reason for doing it is because it i don't know it's kind of fun right but the reason to not do it is the point of the game is you work for a company that doesn't give a about the planet and your whole goal is to just exploit the planet at any cost spew carbon up into the air don't care destroy everything cut down every tree kill every creature mine up all the resources yeah um so that is the point of the game that is the story and lore so in order you know if you're gonna invest in green energy it lore wise it doesn't make much sense but if you balance that with fun then maybe it does make sense or maybe it will be a mod like i mean you know video games is escapism right like we we give you this option like you can go and and be as dirty as you want you can roll around in the mud and use coal as much as you go nuclear like do whatever you want and you guys are like no i want to be clean like which is honorable just don't build a factory and don't cut down trees yeah exactly yeah

> oh hi there my name is Jason the community manager coffee stain studios hey everyone my name is Jason I'm a community manager coffee stain studios I guess and today we're I'm just going to be putting out a bit of information yeah I'm in my home because because isolation social distancing quarantine all of that good stuff I just want to let you all know first of all that a lot of people have been asking about how we're doing here coffee stain not here but there and everyone is safe and healthy so far hopefully that doesn't change anytime soon or ever and we are all working from home are a couple people but this is basically no one at the office anymore so we're we're playing it safe and we're taking care of ourselves we are continual continuing to work from home and we're talking to each other online and all that stuff it's a bit tricky not gonna lie but I think development has slowed down just a little while we adjust to what's going on and how things are gonna work but yeah we're doing our best and things are still moving forward and thank you very much for all the concern so the main topic of today is steam a lot of people want to know what's going on not much has been said yet the reason for that is we as you all know we don't know what's going on 99% of the time and yeah we just we just didn't really know and sometimes we have some ideas of what we want to do but when it's just ideas we don't really want to put that those ideas or guesses out there too much because a lot of folks tend to latch on to that and think it's the truth and it gets their hopes up no we don't want to do that we'd rather wait until we're a little more confident on things and so now we've got some information where we are a little more confident on things so now I can present it to you all so now I can present it to you all now okay so when is the steam release going to come again we don't have an exact date but we do have a better timeframe we were sort of thinking like maybe in April but that's not gonna happen we're pretty confident on May now I don't know if it's beginning middle or end I'm just gonna say middle because if it's a little early then you're gonna be happy if it's a little little late it won't be too late so sometime in May folks yeah really looking forward to bring that out for you guys what will the price of the game be on Steam yeah so the price of satisfactory will be the same on Steam as it is on epic so that is 2995 u.s. dollars or $29.99 euro or the relevant changes between different regions okay so cuz we have regional pricing some of the regional pricing may differ between the stores but for the most part the game should be the same price everywhere will my save files work between the Steam and the epic version yep they totally will so if you happen to own steam and epic they're both gonna work we have no intention of making the save format for each platform different so the early difference is your save files might be located in different places on your computer if I in the game on epic can I transfer that to steam or get a free copy on Steam no you can't do that have no idea how that would work another thing to consider here is epic and steam our competitors you've given your money to epic why would steam give you a free version that's just not gonna happen if you own an epic it's yours an epic will there be cross-platform can I play multiplayer with my friends between Steam and epic yeah yes yeah we're gonna make it uh-huh now the thing with that is we're like 99% sure we're gonna have cross-platform and I'm pretty sure we're gonna have it the only thing is how that's gonna look and how it's gonna work is a little bit up in the air as we continue to develop it now so I can't give you any more information on how that will work and yeah so in the future we'll probably do more information on that okay so that's most of the frequently asked questions about steam so I hope that ties your a little more more information will come later will we also want to like give more information about what will be in the update it's not just steam there's gonna be some new stuff in there as well so hopefully we can do that over the coming weeks yeah so the like okay so the the last thing to address here is you've seen it in the descript Idol of the video snoot and I are leaving coffee-stained we announced that on Twitter we started a new YouTube channel called let's get out yeah you know it's like we figured it was time I've been with Coffee State for five and a half years it's time to move on to other things it's been really fun with you all so it was exciting to announce that I had my heart racing the whole time the other thing though is that we released it on April 1st it was an April Fool's joke so we're fine wish you were here yeah we're still here we're not leaving the channel is real the video is real but we're not leaving coffee-stained it was just a joke it was a very very cruel joke I just want to say though a really big thanks to everyone who supported us a lot of people were like we're gonna miss you and all this stuff and that is really nice I'm sorry I'm sorry we played with your heartstrings I'm also not sorry because I love trolling so much we're not going anywhere I've also sorry that we're not going anywhere yeah so that's the last video for this week but you'll have another one next week anyway that's enough for this video I've gone bananas here in quarantine and isolation remember to take care of yourselves and yeah be safe and I will see you maybe next week it's a bit weird making videos from my home but maybe I'll see you next week but we will also have streams on Tuesday as always at 4 p.m. Sweden time CET 3:00 p.m. GMT so yeah you can catch us there then twitch.tv slash coffee stain studios devs have a lovely day everybody and I'll catch you next time bye

> what boom hello everyone hi hi hi so my name is Jace you probably know that already I'm joined here with Hannah and snit that's me and a big THANK YOU to snowed for for putting this entire stream all the technical stuff together is I'm a fantastic job you'll see how hopefully it'll work so probably should we've seen it don't see don't set it up like it seems great I think it's really great hopefully it'll works out but um yeah so welcome to the stream thank you very much for joining and obviously this is gonna be a Q&amp;A slash kind of like a hangout thing a lot of people are probably gonna ask general questions about satisfactory like release date alpha cos blah blah of course I'll answer that like once or twice but ultimately I don't want to keep repeating answers because we want to move on to other things so that you can cover more things I also suggest I'm incredibly good at not answering things and I'm also not really able to answer a lot of general questions but honestly these two can answer ask them questions you're probably gonna get more out of them than you're gonna get out of me so Hannah is a writer as you can see and level designer I don't know if it's got that they're no writer and level designer and real programmer and I'm the cartoon character sir yeah hit us up with some questions now and question 1 what is wrong with your face is that you mom sorry about that yeah someone's asking pipes no release date actually I can't say something about release really I can say something about release Matt look at that just worked I'm kidding I'll say I'll say something alright so something pretty cool about the release date is what I can say is it is sooner than you think later than you it is sooner than you think the other thing to consider here is we're not the kind of company who's gonna be like here's the release date it's in six months we can't commit to anything in six months we have no idea what the hell is gonna happen we can't commit this [ __ ] we're like yeah we can't we couldn't think we couldn't commit to this 4:00 p.m. start time okay so we can't commit to anything so when we do give a really stay they get the the whatever the release is is gonna happen reasonably soon after that and and I can say that that's that's gonna happen probably sooner than you think we just want things to be the best it can be yeah honestly we want to make a good game crazy who would have thought right yeah I just want money so it's earlier than never earlier than the the heat death of the universe all right this decade maybe we'll see see how much will satisfactory cost I think I know now but I'm definitely not allowed to say but you have said it in the past oh yeah three hundred dollars or something and there's monthly subscription with the thousand sea gems absolutely why he's Jase the PR I ask myself that every day Jimmy's lagging for someone but maybe it's fine for others it's probably on with you so you're like one one thing to point out guys if you notice that something is weird angles as well URLs allows your also yeah everyone if you're all allowed to chime in if something goes wrong with the chat if some not to chat everything's gonna go wrong with the chat something wrong with the stream please point it out shout out and we will do something about it hopefully hopefully probably I've got a couple of people saying stream is lagging stream is fine whatever we'll keep going we go geez Hannity you go clothes shopping in the same place this was a complete accident right totally complete accident not coordinated at all how does the game look because I don't have an alpha key let's let someone else answer something so do you want to answer that the game looks like how does the game look I mean let's just say how's the Alpha pretty good it's pretty good right there where if you guys didn't notice we put out a video where people are alpha testers worked on a bunch of cool levels and we were genuinely like surprised around cool stuff people were making so but that's not to say like everything's been perfect there's been a few issues here in there but overall we've been getting quite good like feedback on alpha and like one thing that I don't think we have announced but we're gonna do now is that we've had multiplayer in alpha for a few days now so we're finally in the phase now where we're starting to roll out the multiplayer aspect of the game and that brought its own party with Nick so this now we introduced more more snowflakes it's fine it's just for you though yeah we got a few more people saying laggy do you know if there's anything that can happen with that I don't know no okay well if not to worry about it as well what type of lag is it lagging like video lag where is it lagging I assume it's extreme lacking really hard is it lagging like sync lag or is it I think it's uh is it is it possible first to like reduce the bitrate yeah yeah we can do that but we have to restart well if it's quick and easy we can just restart immediately yeah it's pretty but I won't guarantee you yeah we'll be we'll be right back we're gonna try fix the lag if we come you go ahead I think it is stuttering buffering yeah already yeah okay so let us know let us know how that goes good stream yeah yeah hopefully it's better now try to reduce the scale there's no quality or equality if it's lagging but yeah let us know well you know this is like our first real stream so we're hopefully figuring this stuff out yep all right so something that I saw [ __ ] I forgot it oh well it was a good question that it was a really good question things go a little faster but keep asking room hopefully we can catch them job opportunities yeah are there any job opportunities I have no idea uh it's no idea but you can always apply yeah that's right we have an open application on our website coffee stain studios comm slash jobs I think yeah not lying it like will debrief PvE or PvP uh there's no PvP no no but there's PvE we have like angry monsters in the world and as you can see some of them in the trailer pay attention yeah if I hadn't closed my thing I could have shown it there's a few things you would obviously as you can see fight flowers flowers are the most lethal thing you can find in this game absolutely committing to it now snip is its server multiplayer dedicated servers or peer-to-peer so it is peer-to-peer we're using a listen server architecture which means that someone sets up the game and acts as a server and then people when people join their hosted game they will be connected to it so that person is the one sending like all the updates and everything which means that the person like acting as host probably needs a good computer the more that connect them the more the more strain you put on the host so to speak but there's no like matchmaking or anything like that we're using epics friends lists stream total new stuff for me the stuff's constant buffing Stream is still mine stop flood it's cuz you guys started spamming so much just lighting up the stream there anything else we can do can we just down scale - yeah weekend everybody we'll be right back after these short Michener's Rises things stuff oh all right right right right yeah I fixed it all right let's see how many times we do this yeah y'all a [ __ ] us around yeah so refresh the page the unimportant thing I forgot to say that refresh the page right now if you were having issues with that yeah so give that a refresh because a lot of people have been saying it's fine yeah all right so let's moving on let's move moving on let's move on are you going on to me we will but will we have what's the possibility of dedicated servers uh we want to have dedicated servers right now we don't fully support it but it's kind yeah we're getting there like we want dedicated servers it's just that we need to spend like production time on actually making sure that runs well and dedicated servers here and right now we're focusing on that it runs it all that runs it all basically yeah but we want that and it's the same thing with mods I guess and just bring that up immediately oh yeah we want lots as well we really want more absolutely but it's the same thing there we we need to spend the production time to make it happen and right now we want the game to run at all yeah we need we need the base game yeah like working really well but we have been like the architecture of the of the game has mods in mind always so whenever we add new stuff or and we develop the engine further we always have like mod support in mind so once we actually start implementing it it will hopefully be okay more straightforward yeah moisture a foot we don't like need to remake aim to support it like in fact at one point in development mods were made even like like so yeah that's that's about as far as we got at that point was like we could make buds and some people outside of the office made some months but yeah we basically event in that for now okay let's get some questions for Hannah banana level design writing questions for us awesome writing Chris's flight as we answered okay probably pick some out so ask them now is there story in the game yes okay I guess I can just elaborate maybe sure yeah that we release story in the game it won't be the main driving force of the game because that's obviously factories and the story itself is largely optional in the way that if you look for it and if you want to to essentially politically wrong with it you can you can find it but it won't be there all the time explicitly essentially so it will essentially be given especially when there is context that is needed or during tutorials for example and story serves a good purpose in that it can tell you why you're here what are you doing what's the goal etcetera etcetera and also for example fix-it the company you work for gives context to the gameplay yeah that's that is it more lore yes yes there's lore yeah it's it's I guess it's more lore kind of stuff that there's also a more like contemporary sir line that plays as you play essentially so it's it's there is something in the background going on that happens because of you it's reactive is there an endgame slash gold yes yes there is I'm not saying you can you can finish the game you can finish the game is it still Simon's the only one who's done it I think I think she was finished okay yeah I know that Simon took 130 hours or something like it was and that was like a year back yeah it was so right now we have no idea how long it will take but we allow us to game quite a lot since imma beat it as well so Simon replay it fairly recently and there's like it's pretty different now compared to when I played it mhm so it's also interesting that that changed a lot yeah yeah there is a delay I think it was like eight seconds yeah yeah that's uh it'sit's a bit short on twitch but we want to do the stream here on YouTube soon can we get your shirts in-game you're good I mean you get red flannel anywhere sure you're wearing a red planet underneath the the spacesuit er yes yeah yes actually that's kind of man a lot of people are asking about terraforming oh yeah no please no the the map itself is handmade we don't have any procedural generation really in it and it will not it be can't change the landscape in itself to to work your base it's more like you have to sort of try to try to work with the landscape that's kind of the challenge we're going with as well like finding good spots and finding interesting spots to make your base work so no question from Timothy Smith large factories seem like they can get complicated with a large number of belts and and he plans for butts or other means of transport other than belts and trains there are vehicles there's a video of like a vehicle showcase on our YouTube channel from a little while ago things have changed a lot they're both in the game and how the vehicles function in fact I just rewrote the drifting mechanics and there's so much better now it's actually good it was pretty good before as well that's way better no sorry so yeah there's that as well for Hannah what resources do you use to help with level design story writing world building actually the devil sauce to another question which is really quick for J's plushies win and what's the actual story behind blame Simon sir behind hashtag William Simon is Simon's fault all the time plushies we're working on it okay Hannah resources do you use for a level design I just work in unreal mostly we have for example an important tools the foliage tool that we use a lot and we work a lot with the landscaping a lot of static meshes that we drag into the level as well it's all think of it as like I don't know playing The Sims but natural world kinda like that as for writing it's mostly I do research a lot especially considering like this is a more technical oriented game I try to familiarize myself with the the science that gets behind things and the technology that gets fine things but I also try to sort of you know it's my brainchild so mostly my brain that's a pretty useful tool someone has asked about a top-down view that's another thing that I have addressed in an earlier like a video way way way back and top-down I understand why people want it but it doesn't make sense in three because like now you can build upwards what does top-down do you actually show you but that doesn't mean like I understand the problem which is people want to see their factory from a different angle and so I think we've already taken some steps to that and there are some other plans or whatever so I can't really telling anything about that and snut yes what system do you use to save maps I heard from Marcus our other programmer say that it took you guys six months to get it working yeah so we're we're basing our seyh system on the way you save in Unreal Engine yeah the way we're using Unreal Engine if if that wasn't clear so in a real engine it's it's like it's there's a system for how you save a normal engine and we're using the same system whereas you mark stuff on properties on actors and stuff like that and then we extend it by having support for there's a lot of like complex saving on certain things and we wanted to have like support for to be able to like load any save whenever and be able to support that like no matter how much we update the engine and stuff like that should always be able to like load the saves that being said there are a few cases where we change game design a lot which can may happen where you might get stuck if you start loading old safes but yeah there's a lot of work that went into making the safe system work which I important it wasn't too involved in so I don't know that that Pacific's specifics but yeah the the amount of time we spent on it is just because we want it to be very very sturdy so that and it's it's not been acting up a lot or at all almost yeah it's been pretty pretty good well there the third person view I think we can confirm that there will be I think it's not in right now we had it at one point before we got rid of it and I think we're gonna reintroduce it but cannot confirm tonight what happened to the large to the Hadron Collider we saw in the UI video I don't know maybe so maybe it's not I just genuinely don't know yeah yep will they be underground subterranean areas of the map there there are caves but depending on the context I saw someone asking about what tools were using we're using visual studio we're using a real engine we're using perforce as our let's go version control yeah thank you Jesus I'm programmer I was like well how do you put stuff in the Bing where you use it for language it's great I'm on Linux okay will the move to have fixed obi time exclusive a permanent it is time exclusive it's 12 months a lot of people said or asked are we gonna be on steam after that again we can't plan anything right so when we say basically the answer is don't know and don't know is not know and it's not yes it is literally don't know we haven't thought that far ahead and we're not gonna right now probably whatever yeah said modes are confirmed how about mods for creating maps will that happen and someone else did house before are we gonna make new maps in the future I have no idea whether that will be a thing that's probably just too solid we don't want to think about that right right now yeah we can finish this one map and then we'll see if if we have the time and resources to make more maps and then as for and as for mods but there aren't people can make their own maps again that's probably something we tackle when we look at momentum will see that can be supported essentially that being said though like I've played this game for a long time I still haven't seen the whole map even I haven't I don't know I don't know my way around every time I go driving I'm just like [ __ ] where am i how do I get back it's it's so big and we've challenged someone to cut like they're like I'm gonna cover the entire map we're like alright try good luck yeah it's just not gonna happen it's just not gonna happen localization support there will be there will be localization support and we will do community driven localization so the community can jump in and and help us improve it which means we should TM be able to support like a bunch of languages basically whoever wants to translate that language gene I love this column is the plan it's a coffee stain yeah coffee stain also known as yeah yeah that's the way we do it any TLC's planned yo dude we haven't even released yet yeah I don't even thinking about it can we have some gameplay we're not doing gameplay today unfortunately we'll have something like video clips pop-up insures or not I get this Tiger there's some gameplay that's crazy yeah there's gameplay literally gameplay yeah hazards in the map yep what kinds exactly I don't think I should tell you we've had a surprise but yes there will be hazardous hello alphas not a scam text I forgot to remove trust us it's no scam the more we say that the more you'll believe is right yeah for Hannah is that an alpha key around your neck maybe like maybe it's the last alpha key it is the only real alpha key can you make custom cars trucks maybe if there are months if I buy an epic now and another platform later will the save files be compatible maybe good question hopefully yeah is the answer hopefully because I don't think save files are like tied to the server well maybe I don't know but no they're not yeah you can like load and save and send your save file to the host or whatnot and they can load it a stuff so it's not tied so but but saves like when you're joining someone when they're hosting it's their save file that you're playing on so it's not like across what you can call it like some games have where when some when two people play together they're both playing on their save file so to speak so if one unlocks something the other one also gets it that's not the case in satisfactory if you're playing as hosts and people are joining you you're you're unlocking stuff on the host side file Oh someone asked if there's gonna be free updates after the game is released or is it all going to be DLCs after the game is released to the public we will be doing free updates yeah because we're don't bug fixes we're gonna be doing for the balancing adding new features yeah basically so the answer is yes any plans for pvp nope cooperative play it's cool we like friendly like people yeah it's us against nature screw nature why nerd turrets like sanctum why do you need tarts in this game when they're sanctum yeah uh uh our director yeah the director of the game kind of answered this and basically it was just as we were developing the game and designing it we just felt we didn't need it no like it just wasn't necessary and and you know we had it in the beginning and even though we had it we still were like we don't need this and we got rid of it so I know that that might sound counterintuitive to some but there is like the concept of less is more sometimes and cutting things out can often be the best thing and I think that's what at least the director believes I I'm an idiot so I'm just down with that whatever if you really really hurts Therese your mots turrets menthe alright alright yes is caught style in line refocus on solo it's it's solo or caught there's no difference yeah you can play it single-player

> plugins are using are you talking about the game or a stream cuz I can tell you what plugins are using the stream you know what happens when you die you die you die in real life facilities the game use any luck step any concern for desync across a large map no there's no concern there are no D sinks ya know at the very least not from a large map now I think there are no D sinks I hope not yeah it shouldn't be right now what do you make your model such texturing with none of us a 3d artist but I'm pretty sure they just use like Photoshop in Maya maybe that brush yeah I think computer player limits we support for but we're not gonna put a limit so in you and your hundred friends if you have I don't believe that for a second yeah you were your hundred friends can join a server and it'll crash but if but we're not gonna help you there by all means just try it let us know let us know how it goes yeah yeah scream Capet we'd love to see how it dies yes so right now we're testing for four is four plays the recommended number not per se really honest with anything I mean it could be that you know you want to have people are looking for different things from the game some people really want to manage the factory some people really want to go out there and find resources that way cuz whenever I play with people I'm like I always like okay I'm gonna line everything up perfect and then someone's like I'm just gonna put this here and put this down I'm like mmm but it's not it's not straight though I'm person number two that shouldn't be straight yeah there was can i play as Kristen Stewart though we would welcome for anyone are there any difficulty adjustments when playing multiplayer I don't really think and that's it it doesn't really get easier does it not really it's a little faster I guess doesn't really get here though it depends on your ability to multitask and coordinate with your friends instead yeah I don't think it I don't think it needs it I mean the challenge in itself isn't really based on like difficulty because we don't it's it's just building something together yeah like that's what it's about feels like you can you can argue the same thing we're like you have one programmer it takes a month to do a task but you got another another programmer now it takes two months the more people you have the more you're probably gonna fight about how you pick your friends yeah that's my friends will there be co2 emissions and will affect the ecosystems no but we really thought about that we did yeah like different different types of energy winning and such yeah what could be more environmentally friendly not but it makes everything so complex yeah I mean it might be an issue we might revisit later but right now again there are more important things yeah exactly and otherwise hey months but will they be a founders plak plak plak will they be a founders pack with alpha access um we're not no comment yeah name maybe I don't know developer Diaries is that like developer sort of like more developer Hyatt like updates maybe you know the highlights bit like update videos like in here this is where the vehicles are now oh yeah I mean it could be good the the main issue with a lot of the content we have so many content ideas and we get a lot of content ideas from you guys as well but it's it's honestly just time that's the thing it's just not much time like as I'm I'm loosely a programmer and for for like the longest time last year I couldn't do any of it because I was so busy with community management and and even then I couldn't put out as much content as that's that just a taste of their quality videos yeah yeah exactly are you in a cinema yes we are you have a cinema here so we're in the cinema right yeah we're not spoil yeah not at all no it only seats eight people it's not that snow that big again pick your friends yeah with resource nodes are you going to run out of the one load fast and have to change nodes often we have like recesses that run out and resources that don't run out so it depends on like which one you use but generally no because it's already too much having to you know people want to restructure the factory anyways we don't want to force it too much sandbox mode available I assume this is what people also call a creative mode which I assume is just no limit for you know you don't need to what you don't need resources to build things you just build structures I I mean I assume that we'll have it at some point but we sort of thought about this before and basically no at least not at the beginning because in the beginning times we're gonna need feedback from people and if we have a create a creative mode where people just do any old [ __ ] then it's really hard for us to know what feedback comes from where especially when we need balanced feedback so so whether there's gonna be a sandbox mode or not you know we can't commit to that right now the címon gonna be the last boss yes

> how big can you make your factory I guess we can touch on optimization here as well yes sir so your factories can technically or theoretically be as big as you want them to be so it all comes down to a beautiful computer you have promising no but we're working hard on like optimizing the game there are a lot of factors that comes into it like first of all it's an open-world game which it's in itself is pretty taxing because you can't load everything at the same time because the world is too big so we're streaming like tiles or what we call and dance like parts of the of the world depending on where you are and then when you build factors all over the place there's optimization to handle when you walk away from this so they don't render or run unnecessary CPU time and where was I going with this we're talking about socialization there's also net code like how much when you were playing multiplayer also how much net net cohere sending and how much packets you're sending etcetera etc what was the real question though that was Dale I mean it was it was how big of a factory can you make yeah and so I think maybe one thing to touch on there is the like the instant splines for example yeah so like everything is relative and in the game so you can make like you can probably do a lot of stuff but there's there's a ton of like it depends is the boring answer because like when we talk about conveyor belt specifically like when you look at conveyor belts it depends on like what's visible on it and you know how they're placed especially that we were optimizing it so that we reduced draw calls as much as possible on the spine or on the conveyor belt specifically so that you don't see when you see stuff in the world it's not too taxing and then also like when you start stepping away from stuff that it's not updated as often so there's there's a lot of stuff we can still do right now for optimizing it but we build pretty big factories ourselves right now so yeah it's it's like it's a relative question I guess it is kind of hard to answer we've done a lot of stuff with optimization I think we still have a lot of a lot of like ideas so I yeah else we can optimize so and I think it's kind of cool so yeah talk about the game if it's totally broken and full of glitches is that the case how much percentage of the game is even implemented it's not really like glitchy I mean actually laying playing for yeah the people in the Alpha have very little like big issues with when it considers optimization and performance actually that's one of personal miss points I think yeah right now so it's been actually really good yeah it's pretty good in terms of how much money what percentage this are really a question we can answer not really percentage-wise no doesn't make much sense for us cuz because a lot of it can also be like depending on a feedback may change what we need to do it also and it's also not good aspect when you in production wise sometimes we don't fully implement everything like there are issues that we are aware of but we just want to like try it so like this there's a there's a few glitches that I know personally that I've like let like fix that right now because I know it's it I know it exists and I know how to fix it but I'd rather spend time on fixing something else that's more like what people want in the Alpha right now we are listening to a lot of what people are asking about like specific features are specific bugs that exist right now yeah that's what the Alpha is partly for yeah it's getting feedback mostly for Jase give me your sucks well a lot of people are retired yeah yeah you know what I can wear these for seven days and you get like seven day dirty socks oh yeah they're gonna go for a good price you just bid for it yeah it's gonna happen my socks I don't care I'll take your cash money for it are they going to be collectibles Easter eggs shrines to your previous game sitting around two different probably maybe good maybe I often do change her hair color oh I'm actually curious Lin stuff um I mean like it's changed here but it's just faded honestly that's all it is every couple months it's usually a little expensive so I just try saving money is there a height limit it's the skybox how high is the skybox sky's the limit very high pretty high we've had some people hit it just by like building directly up I know our our tester yeah he hit it and he was just like building underneath himself like like 30 40 minutes or something something like that it's ridiculous you're not gonna be able to factory that I challenge you yeah yeah yeah people have tried in performance might not be optimal up there yeah I think just all the tiles are gonna be garbage yeah where have you learned your unreal skills I mean obviously everyone has learned in their own time and way but you can also say when it comes to coffee stain we have used Unreal Engine since [ __ ] before coffee stain existed like so before coffee stain existed a few other people here did a UDK like mod or something which was sanctum one a demo for that and ever since then it's just been Unreal Engine for literally everything we've done so this studio has just been Unreal Engine so there's that and I think I don't know correct me if I'm wrong maybe you guys might also know about I think like even from the big very very beginning like this studio was founded on like a bunch of students who made a project and they wanted to make it in a real engine specifically and at the time they were like like you're not supposed to use engines so they they said okay it's fine if you're all artists like no programmers and I think that says a lot of Unreal Engine that they may like managed to make a game with that a single programmer in it and then after that that was like alright let's make something out of this and Chandon want to share with the class yes Jase make that smile from one month what's a THQ Dornoch acquisition that happened you already got at once I like the hash tag is there going to be survival elements to keep the player alive it would no no this is it's a management game it's not a survival game kinda he's like drink water no no no there's nothing there's nothing like that in a game you're just you're fine all the time magically don't find an explanation somehow how is huge THQ Nordic been to you guys in the project there you haven't done anything yeah will they be VR support sorry I didn't mean to just do that people have asked about VR support that would that was about like holy [ __ ] it's gonna be so much occult yeah and also again it's one of those there are more important things to do and it's not like a game that was built with VR in mind as well and when it comes to VR you need to you need to think about it yeah standard design principles don't work yeah on PRI developer fire before it's very different like it's a lot of things that work for for normal games design practices and even just art art styles or certain tricks that you use just don't work at all anymore and you have to find a completely different way to interact with it so you have to it can't use VRS a gimmick it doesn't really work it needs to be the whole game needs to be made with VR in mind yes otherwise it doesn't work I feel like it's the same principle it's like we want to make them like if you want to have multiplayer in a game you can I want to have that in mind yeah yeah so yeah otherwise it's gonna be a hassle to like start your like force it in because not only is it a like interaction problem with they are not problem but like we don't know the best way yet in general like how do you handle input and stuff like that but also from a technical side like do you need to optimize a lot for specifically we are there's a lot of solutions you need to have yeah in order for it to work so it was a lot of work and how spit slash Jace how do you divide work amongst the various programmers on the team we have I was gonna say why are you looking at me and I'm like wait I'm I'm kind of a special case which is just not doing me any saying that is not doing me any so we have our producers or producer which kind of have a good sense of what's going on overall in the game so they collect feedback from like how are the artists working or what are they artists working on right now with the program is working on right now I like all the different game development prints whatever so they tend to like gather information and talk to our talk to our leads in the various fields so like to talk to our graphics lead and our program lead discuss like what do we need right now what can we do right now what's important for our developers right now so that all trickles down to the programmers where we have daily stand-ups and planning meetings where we discuss like if you want to implement this how hard can be and what are you weren't like and then we get to work and then we talk about what are we working on right now so we have daily stand-ups where we discussed that and then yeah I mentioned the leads have their own meetings in in my case because I do a lot of community management stuff I can be out of touch with the programming that has gone on in the project at large so I tend to take on things that are independent from what other people do so I I have been doing the vehicle since the beginning which is has been a lot of work but but these days like when I was redoing the drifting there's no dependency on any other programmer for me to rework drifting for example so I've been doing a bunch of things like that and there's like we all we're not a lot of people in studio know like it's not a super big studio when you're five or so bit more now we're gonna be about 30 so like no programmer is really like you're only doing that code stuff or you're only doing AI stuff so we're all kind of like split we take we tried to like generalize as much as possible so that everybody can jump in and do stuff to it but obviously like some people have done like specialize and stuff for the game like you've done vehicles yeah I've done a lot of net code like you I should yeah you mentioned enemies earlier but now you say there will be nothing to worry about what's up I think from that you mean nothing to worry about in terms of survival was what we were saying I think what we refer to there is you don't need to drink you don't need to things like that sleep yeah but but the enemies can you know they can kill you yeah they can still get you yep they may seem docile but they are quick yeah especially in lizard eyes there's cold eyes murder can't trust him I just sorry all the alien birds out there yeah there was someone before who else are they gonna be NPCs that you get quest from blah blah blah no there's not that

> wait ready which one who is the funniest at the stand-ups well you're never there obviously me yep everyone else is dead inside for a herring on my jo excite yes it's fresh when I come in and they're gonna be like never thought we'd say this yeah they were like I thought it was bad before and that's nuts here so yeah yeah please come back how does it take to build a medium-sized factory I think that's completely relative depends on what you think it's medium-sized yeah there's that but there's also depends on your OCD when it comes to refactoring yeah some people don't get very far because they're like this isn't quite perfect I'm redoing my basic iron production or something all over again so like which is satisfying which is fine I mean that's a bad way to play I'm not like [ __ ] on that but it will take more time exactly it's kind of hard to know I love when you build a factory you abandon it and go somewhere else and and do the refactoring somewhere else and you come back to you earlier you like Oh God God Oh what is this oh no did I do this no let's purge it with fire yeah can I build as high as I want we kind of answered that before it's just up to the skybox but there's no physics that's gonna knock you everything yep any plans for stuff like blueprints as in like the factorial blueprinting no we answered that in a video once before basically you know it's it's a thing that we thought about as well but at this point no maybe we will I don't know we'll see will it be out of space in galaxies no how did you come up with the name Oh a satisfactory no no it was it it was a it was a big process yeah yeah and it took us so long it was like no it was like ironically no one was satisfied yeah it was like it was like two weeks before like the or like a month before the reveal or whatever his name right now like alright we'll just go as satisfactory I guess it's been the working title for so long everyone got used to it I guess yeah yeah it's the company as well I was one of the people who hated it yeah yeah I hated it but but I got I'm I think it's good now yeah yeah but I I was one of the people who's like no to bed it's a warm yeah it took me like a year it took us just maybe they gave and putting it out there but it's like did you get indoctrinated or did you actually get one over who knows you know they could have been some subliminal stuff or they put something in my water because it is a pretty big task to name again yeah yeah it is sometimes it's like you you make a game base up like a name like a funny name something but if ya think it's around me like it's like this represents us our soul our hearts our identity it's just crisis this Factory yeah it's not it's not amazing it's just it's it's fine it's also a nice thing that if we just get average reviews it's like above 50% it's a little going for yeah that's how high we yeah yeah we're getting a lot of questions that have been asked before like translating the game or when is released even though we didn't really answer that but we can't just keep going over the same questions over and over so sorry but you may have missed some of the vlog before and you can watch it again what's the entire thing I'm sorry yeah we have to move on to like other things as well yeah and like peer to peer servers are dedicated that was answered before for Hannah besides the starting Aires will there be random spawns in the release i legit don't know if that's gonna be a thing yeah at the moment no no spawns of resources what I assume that's a good like what is the context of yes I mean I guess either yeah maybe either resources have set locations that I can answer they part of it by their part of the environment we built them in that way but like considering player spawns was first far as I know no but is the question about how long we've been in game dev each person like personally I think next in the longest of us Lee I've been a game de force five six five years give or take like working full-time at Lee yeah if if we're talking working full-time almost exactly two years right there comes seven years I'm a newbie seven years I think for me this is my first proper project on this way so can we crush our friends with orbital drops like sanctums thank you style you can't you can't crush them stuff like that but you can absolutely drive your vehicle of your friends yeah yeah you'd be like it's a new mode of transport actually we do that sometimes yeah faster did you stand with someone else's vehicle yeah so like PvP it's well I got a good one for Hanna can you tell us your favorite place on the map and why have you done the day night thing yeah that's a good one favorite place on the map I mean if I wanna if I want to stroke my own ego I'd say I'd say the desert that's that's an area I've worked on the most but if we're talking like proper proper favorite place gosh okay I would say yeah deserts I just like deserts they're nice I like this area Lee there's a swampy ish kinda I made that well you made it I like I love this yeah that one's no cool just made that one good can you say my name really quickly it would make my diet date I'd rather die I thought you said could you say my name real quick it would make my diet like my diet no just kidding blood money to you man toy toy dude this is that's my tribe it made your day love away why I kept seeing like all the time we're a pair of glasses snoot why what's the deal of it maybe I think they you look like someone I think like someone I think they said something like that yeah what hmm how can I get the key to Hanna not what I didn't get it no I get it my key well not alpha key to your heart a surprise but I think you guys same yeah definitely bribery what happens to player eventually when they are run over by a friend in vehicle a cadence probably died if you probably probably can we say look what happens if you die with in terms of you in the very probably right of your inventory yeah sure you you lose it but you don't lose you can get it back yeah go back and pick it up yeah so it's it's yeah it's like dark so it's not like this game I wanted to make that joke but I like no I'm not gonna no I'm gonna how many items exist oh you like to greater than 1 greater than yes that's it's a lot of items basically yeah a lot of buildings did not count no it looks like Michael from Vsauce oh yeah some people were saying why is Michael from Vsauce Michael here I'm sorry that was probably pretty loud in the mic or maybe not oh my god yeah yeah I'm not gonna hear that ever gave me I can't wait to grow my hair back yet now yeah you better cuz you need a new disguise oh that's why them can sing glasses how many load levels you use that's a question for Simon like a bazillion yeah all is a print screen natural put it somewhere else that I can find it that was that I did good okay be on eBay with Jason sucks yeah available in steam in the future we don't know genuinely don't know there's we don't know when you die some up it what made you cut your hair because I donated my hair if you oh yeah I didn't notice I add like super long hair and then I cuz Hannah cut her hair and I was like yeah we had the same hair sighs so I got it and donate it to kids who have alopecia and I can't wait to dye my hair again because I haven't been able to do that because I want to donate my hair really so I can have LuAnn and like crazy here so I can fit in again yes like these my hair is fading I say not he's not part of the group man it's like even these shirts kind of Rob yeah I'm the black sheep the white red flash yeah yeah Doku gun room you can we doing mascara lease of 50,000 if Lord Simon allows it no but this is a good quest like things to lead into a lot of people saying why don't you send out more alpha keys why don't you just send it to everyone more people means more feedback and that will help and that's not all exactly true if we get too many people in we will get more feedback but there is such a thing as too much feedback and if we get too much feedback then we will not be able to wade through the noise and try to find what's important and fix things so that's kind of why we limit the number to something that is always manageable for us and we don't bite off more than we can chew the other reason is and this is a probably a bit too straightforward but ultimately the elf the Alpha keys and the Alpha is actually not for you it's for us to develop the game so I know like a lot of people say I've just been looking forward to the game just give it to me right it's like but we're like hang on we need to get the right people that we want the right amount and at the right time so sorry if that doesn't give everyone what they want but we're doing what's best for us so that the game gets as good as it possibly can be and there's also the aspect of first time plate like your first time experience you only get one of those so whenever we test stuff and we start adding news like that will change the first time user experience so if we gave the keys to everybody they would all experience the game at that point at the same time and then we wouldn't have the opportunity to address any of the issues that the first time experience that yes yeah so that's also one big thing why you might hold off on testing on some people so to speak you are one of the rescueteers to be LGBT friendly or at least open about it why is it so important for you is this to you for me it's important just because like I try not to especially on YouTube and stuff I try not to just like shove it down anyone's faces or anything instead for me as bisexual dude I like to just just be on the screen and just be there and then everyone just gets to know who I am and hopefully just gets okay with the fact that I'm not straight but and to me that that that's important and I know that the Institute entire studio is very much LGBTQ from yeah just just in general just very open-minded and very supportive yeah we've got a few we've got a fair few LGBT folks here yeah thinking forearm stance there on the Alpha keys yeah dude I'll always give the honest answer if I can answer sometimes I can answer though any timeline of when the NDA will be released well Jesus it'll be obviously dumb question some time before the Alpha is released but as I said kind of earlier that's gonna an announcement about that will probably be happening sooner than you think that's the best I can say but later than you hope let's make the same joke again all right sir on service we've answered that before sorry we're not I'm trying not to answer the same questions ever ever yeah where is Simon I don't know he's behind us all yeah everyone spin around three times and say Simon if you can save Simon appeared regretted oh that's why he's here now yeah I'm sorry I suppose it's actually Jason's fault yeah blame case any plans for harnessing mod life for your base listed ogres as pack animals over up which sort of touches aren't a question that other people have asked about Ken animals follow you around like pets yeah kind of like pets what do we say maybe if you try hard enough I think maybe if you buy him a drink first well as you could see in the basic gameplay / convey about gameplay vids I made you could pet that lose a dog oh he just got mad at me and ran away or it got him mad at me right away my tinder experience but but yeah that's check - real but I can say but yeah you can also follow you around it's possible but I'm not gonna tell you anything about it yep can you see you character third-person did we touch on this so we're not gonna have three together basically it's not supported now we had it before maybe we'll have it later mmm there you go what's the biggest bug you guys have seen so far I got a good one you do yeah go ahead okay oh this is a good one I like I'm thinking to turn him into a video it's an idea that we've had but people have been a little hesitant to show like you heard it here first folks but this is gonna be a girlfriend it was I hope I don't go on too long about this but it was with the vehicles and I had a test level with a ramp and if you drove up the ramp to a certain point and hit the brakes then the and and on the map that was a we tested these teleporters and I have no idea it was gonna happen alright I actually genuinely don't but we had these like test teleporters and there was one on the other side of the mountain and if you drove this vehicle up on this rent to a certain point and hit and then stopped it disappeared and drove out of the teleporter we're like what the hell is going on right and if you go in the vehicle and you stop it so like before if you stopped at me hop down with root cellar if you're in it you died and the game crashed and then we had no idea what was going on and we found out that it was triggering a plant later as well that was crashing and we had no idea what was going on and then we realized that I had added camber support which is to make the wheels do this and in one case there was a the possibility to divide by zero and so then that would happen put infinite forces on the vehicle the vehicle became infinitely as big and then it crashed right but if it went infinitely is big and it hit the teleporter then it overlapped the teleporter and drove out of it beautiful yeah that's a good one beautiful I love [ __ ] like that where it's like you have to smooth out what the hell is happening yeah it was bizarre yeah that was a hard one question for you what is the sense of humor / memes come from so natural we're pretty tired like yeah super boring at work yes you saw the THQ yeah really are the rest of it is alive yeah no but the the honest there's the truth is Carson's been like this since the very beginning I wasn't there from the very beginning but it's always been like that even if you look at so sanctum and sanctum 2 are more serious games but even in there there's like a lot of like weird Easter eggs like these Fresno horses floating around in this dark room it's like what the hell is that about has nothing to do with anything yeah but that goes in there right and then goat simulator happened of course it's just how we've been all the time and even if you think about goat simulator that was a game that had like a lot of commentary on the game industry and and like twitch bait and things like that as well as even Kickstarter you know it we sort of just turned everything into memes and so that's just kind of happening now as satisfactory or that's what I'm doing it's gonna happen whether you like it or not yeah it's pretty relaxed here well yeah we joke around a bunch me and Simon have the thing where we do this yeah are you watching Simon are you watching got him do that it was like I was gonna include this thing yeah in the will they be breakdowns of machines then you have to fix and repair good answer please don't firm that a rubber bone what the hell a rubber bum bum Oh what is their goats and satisfactory I don't think so it's that would be a fantastic goats speaking of these cards we have his tricks like already in yeah already mmm don't say yeah don't say any of them yeah yes sir yeah of course yeah no how much time have you invested currently in satisfactory it's like three years I'm invested I don't know how many hours it's like what if you play the game that you're developing as much as I feel like I didn't phrase that correctly what if what if you played any game as much as you played it when you're developing yes I didn't I was I was gonna say like you probably don't know we're talking about because you probably rate play more runescape than your entire life foot but like I mean I played a lot of inside runescape that Freudian slip yeah yeah I'm gonna say it's game here but I was but I meant good simulators but I didn't really played much outside of work I don't really satisfactory that much however if you play it like yeah yeah will there be any cosmetics available player colours uniforms well there is the ability to paint buildings and vehicles different colors can be useful for color coding sections of you factory whatever well just for aesthetic reasons someone did ask before if there's gonna be any sort of just purely aesthetic things that you can build like Windows whatever and there are some yeah I think there's gonna be more in the future I think what we're hoping yeah we're planning yeah III would really want it as well because I think would add a lot of value I think a lot of people would really love like putting a couch down yeah down a table like they'd make it look pretty that I think people would love that I mean yeah we're all for personalizing the you know Factory in the spaces but it all comes back to will they be jetpacks in satisfactory yes yep it's do the trailer it's in the trailer so I'm the site as well so how the alpha testers done any art using walls and paint gun well the way I'm not gonna say that actually but not I mean all right I don't I don't think so I think they've just made beautiful factories as you can see on the screen right now you know I think we have to wrap this up soon it's been about an hour even taking into account that we we're late you weren't late when you talk about it yeah we said we said 420 you're on 420 yeah we were on time on it and somebody in a year I'll be 12
>
> [Laughter]
>
> long-range transport one more good question go go go just one more quick good question then we're just gonna answer here's the best question so far can i play a civilization session with you Jace no one more good question pipes nut that's a bad question will it be terraforming answered that one control the support yeah controls we and do we end on control support I guess we do control support we have it right now I think I haven't tested anyway like yeah it's country I think we're gonna have it and we have had it all this time the tricky thing with keeping up to date with our control support is we keep adding features taking things out and remapping things over and over and then it's like it's like we don't know if this is gonna work the way we want we don't know if we want this menu or this button or this function or whatever and then then basically the control the support just falls apart because no one's kept up to date with it but I think when we get to specific milestones then the controller will be considered again and then tightened up and then because it's also the aspect of like when we add new features we don't want an SS able to be like because when you're when you're live with the game you have to take all things into consideration every time so like how does it work with control like control support so if we had a new feature we have to test it with like oh how does it with keyboard how does it work with control sport how does work with all these different types of controls you know stuff like that and right now we'd rather test features and like try them implement them and see what happens rather than try to kind of be tied back by those types of theö but there is some control support right now yeah but I'm not sure with the state of it supports it whether or not the buttons are mapped to the Google things I don't think I know that out UI the entire time had kept control of your mind yeah I don't know where that is now yeah yes it's still yeah UI at least is supported you program your side all right I think we're done yeah all right cool not looking at any more questions no closing the window even done all right well thank you all very much for tuning in I had a lot of fun hmm these guys did all right but yeah I think hopefully we're gonna be doing more live streaming stuff in the future yeah so we can have a more technical day at the very least this you know this was kind of a trial run as well to see what's it like live streaming interacting with you I think it went well sounds very fun you know yeah and we have some other live stream ideas as well which I say this and hopefully don't get in trouble for saying it but it may happen it may not happen yet but we'll try make it happen because it's a really good idea yep okay so thanks for tuning in yeah yep and I will catch you all later then we share the vaad paint with people yeah hopefully yeah thank you everyone

> what boom hello everyone hi hi hi so my name is Jace you probably know that already I'm joined here with Hannah and snit that's me and a big THANK YOU to snowed for for putting this entire stream all the technical stuff together is I'm a fantastic job you'll see how hopefully it'll work so probably should we've seen it don't see don't set it up like it seems great I think it's really great hopefully it'll works out but um yeah so welcome to the stream thank you very much for joining and obviously this is gonna be a Q&amp;A slash kind of like a hangout thing a lot of people are probably gonna ask general questions about satisfactory like release date alpha cos blah blah of course I'll answer that like once or twice but ultimately I don't want to keep repeating answers because we want to move on to other things so that you can cover more things I also suggest I'm incredibly good at not answering things and I'm also not really able to answer a lot of general questions but honestly these two can answer ask them questions you're probably gonna get more out of them than you're gonna get out of me so Hannah is a writer as you can see and level designer I don't know if it's got that they're no writer and level designer and real programmer and I'm the cartoon character sir yeah hit us up with some questions now and question 1 what is wrong with your face is that you mom sorry about that yeah someone's asking pipes no release date actually I can't say something about release really I can say something about release Matt look at that just worked I'm kidding I'll say I'll say something alright so something pretty cool about the release date is what I can say is it is sooner than you think later than you it is sooner than you think the other thing to consider here is we're not the kind of company who's gonna be like here's the release date it's in six months we can't commit to anything in six months we have no idea what the hell is gonna happen we can't commit this [ __ ] we're like yeah we can't we couldn't think we couldn't commit to this 4:00 p.m. start time okay so we can't commit to anything so when we do give a really stay they get the the whatever the release is is gonna happen reasonably soon after that and and I can say that that's that's gonna happen probably sooner than you think we just want things to be the best it can be yeah honestly we want to make a good game crazy who would have thought right yeah I just want money so it's earlier than never earlier than the the heat death of the universe all right this decade maybe we'll see see how much will satisfactory cost I think I know now but I'm definitely not allowed to say but you have said it in the past oh yeah three hundred dollars or something and there's monthly subscription with the thousand sea gems absolutely why he's Jase the PR I ask myself that every day Jimmy's lagging for someone but maybe it's fine for others it's probably on with you so you're like one one thing to point out guys if you notice that something is weird angles as well URLs allows your also yeah everyone if you're all allowed to chime in if something goes wrong with the chat if some not to chat everything's gonna go wrong with the chat something wrong with the stream please point it out shout out and we will do something about it hopefully hopefully probably I've got a couple of people saying stream is lagging stream is fine whatever we'll keep going we go geez Hannity you go clothes shopping in the same place this was a complete accident right totally complete accident not coordinated at all how does the game look because I don't have an alpha key let's let someone else answer something so do you want to answer that the game looks like how does the game look I mean let's just say how's the Alpha pretty good it's pretty good right there where if you guys didn't notice we put out a video where people are alpha testers worked on a bunch of cool levels and we were genuinely like surprised around cool stuff people were making so but that's not to say like everything's been perfect there's been a few issues here in there but overall we've been getting quite good like feedback on alpha and like one thing that I don't think we have announced but we're gonna do now is that we've had multiplayer in alpha for a few days now so we're finally in the phase now where we're starting to roll out the multiplayer aspect of the game and that brought its own party with Nick so this now we introduced more more snowflakes it's fine it's just for you though yeah we got a few more people saying laggy do you know if there's anything that can happen with that I don't know no okay well if not to worry about it as well what type of lag is it lagging like video lag where is it lagging I assume it's extreme lacking really hard is it lagging like sync lag or is it I think it's uh is it is it possible first to like reduce the bitrate yeah yeah we can do that but we have to restart well if it's quick and easy we can just restart immediately yeah it's pretty but I won't guarantee you yeah we'll be we'll be right back we're gonna try fix the lag if we come you go ahead I think it is stuttering buffering yeah already yeah okay so let us know let us know how that goes good stream yeah yeah hopefully it's better now try to reduce the scale there's no quality or equality if it's lagging but yeah let us know well you know this is like our first real stream so we're hopefully figuring this stuff out yep all right so something that I saw [ __ ] I forgot it oh well it was a good question that it was a really good question things go a little faster but keep asking room hopefully we can catch them job opportunities yeah are there any job opportunities I have no idea uh it's no idea but you can always apply yeah that's right we have an open application on our website coffee stain studios comm slash jobs I think yeah not lying it like will debrief PvE or PvP uh there's no PvP no no but there's PvE we have like angry monsters in the world and as you can see some of them in the trailer pay attention yeah if I hadn't closed my thing I could have shown it there's a few things you would obviously as you can see fight flowers flowers are the most lethal thing you can find in this game absolutely committing to it now snip is its server multiplayer dedicated servers or peer-to-peer so it is peer-to-peer we're using a listen server architecture which means that someone sets up the game and acts as a server and then people when people join their hosted game they will be connected to it so that person is the one sending like all the updates and everything which means that the person like acting as host probably needs a good computer the more that connect them the more the more strain you put on the host so to speak but there's no like matchmaking or anything like that we're using epics friends lists stream total new stuff for me the stuff's constant buffing Stream is still mine stop flood it's cuz you guys started spamming so much just lighting up the stream there anything else we can do can we just down scale - yeah weekend everybody we'll be right back after these short Michener's Rises things stuff oh all right right right right yeah I fixed it all right let's see how many times we do this yeah y'all a [ __ ] us around yeah so refresh the page the unimportant thing I forgot to say that refresh the page right now if you were having issues with that yeah so give that a refresh because a lot of people have been saying it's fine yeah all right so let's moving on let's move moving on let's move on are you going on to me we will but will we have what's the possibility of dedicated servers uh we want to have dedicated servers right now we don't fully support it but it's kind yeah we're getting there like we want dedicated servers it's just that we need to spend like production time on actually making sure that runs well and dedicated servers here and right now we're focusing on that it runs it all that runs it all basically yeah but we want that and it's the same thing with mods I guess and just bring that up immediately oh yeah we want lots as well we really want more absolutely but it's the same thing there we we need to spend the production time to make it happen and right now we want the game to run at all yeah we need we need the base game yeah like working really well but we have been like the architecture of the of the game has mods in mind always so whenever we add new stuff or and we develop the engine further we always have like mod support in mind so once we actually start implementing it it will hopefully be okay more straightforward yeah moisture a foot we don't like need to remake aim to support it like in fact at one point in development mods were made even like like so yeah that's that's about as far as we got at that point was like we could make buds and some people outside of the office made some months but yeah we basically event in that for now okay let's get some questions for Hannah banana level design writing questions for us awesome writing Chris's flight as we answered okay probably pick some out so ask them now is there story in the game yes okay I guess I can just elaborate maybe sure yeah that we release story in the game it won't be the main driving force of the game because that's obviously factories and the story itself is largely optional in the way that if you look for it and if you want to to essentially politically wrong with it you can you can find it but it won't be there all the time explicitly essentially so it will essentially be given especially when there is context that is needed or during tutorials for example and story serves a good purpose in that it can tell you why you're here what are you doing what's the goal etcetera etcetera and also for example fix-it the company you work for gives context to the gameplay yeah that's that is it more lore yes yes there's lore yeah it's it's I guess it's more lore kind of stuff that there's also a more like contemporary sir line that plays as you play essentially so it's it's there is something in the background going on that happens because of you it's reactive is there an endgame slash gold yes yes there is I'm not saying you can you can finish the game you can finish the game is it still Simon's the only one who's done it I think I think she was finished okay yeah I know that Simon took 130 hours or something like it was and that was like a year back yeah it was so right now we have no idea how long it will take but we allow us to game quite a lot since imma beat it as well so Simon replay it fairly recently and there's like it's pretty different now compared to when I played it mhm so it's also interesting that that changed a lot yeah yeah there is a delay I think it was like eight seconds yeah yeah that's uh it'sit's a bit short on twitch but we want to do the stream here on YouTube soon can we get your shirts in-game you're good I mean you get red flannel anywhere sure you're wearing a red planet underneath the the spacesuit er yes yeah yes actually that's kind of man a lot of people are asking about terraforming oh yeah no please no the the map itself is handmade we don't have any procedural generation really in it and it will not it be can't change the landscape in itself to to work your base it's more like you have to sort of try to try to work with the landscape that's kind of the challenge we're going with as well like finding good spots and finding interesting spots to make your base work so no question from Timothy Smith large factories seem like they can get complicated with a large number of belts and and he plans for butts or other means of transport other than belts and trains there are vehicles there's a video of like a vehicle showcase on our YouTube channel from a little while ago things have changed a lot they're both in the game and how the vehicles function in fact I just rewrote the drifting mechanics and there's so much better now it's actually good it was pretty good before as well that's way better no sorry so yeah there's that as well for Hannah what resources do you use to help with level design story writing world building actually the devil sauce to another question which is really quick for J's plushies win and what's the actual story behind blame Simon sir behind hashtag William Simon is Simon's fault all the time plushies we're working on it okay Hannah resources do you use for a level design I just work in unreal mostly we have for example an important tools the foliage tool that we use a lot and we work a lot with the landscaping a lot of static meshes that we drag into the level as well it's all think of it as like I don't know playing The Sims but natural world kinda like that as for writing it's mostly I do research a lot especially considering like this is a more technical oriented game I try to familiarize myself with the the science that gets behind things and the technology that gets fine things but I also try to sort of you know it's my brainchild so mostly my brain that's a pretty useful tool someone has asked about a top-down view that's another thing that I have addressed in an earlier like a video way way way back and top-down I understand why people want it but it doesn't make sense in three because like now you can build upwards what does top-down do you actually show you but that doesn't mean like I understand the problem which is people want to see their factory from a different angle and so I think we've already taken some steps to that and there are some other plans or whatever so I can't really telling anything about that and snut yes what system do you use to save maps I heard from Marcus our other programmer say that it took you guys six months to get it working yeah so we're we're basing our seyh system on the way you save in Unreal Engine yeah the way we're using Unreal Engine if if that wasn't clear so in a real engine it's it's like it's there's a system for how you save a normal engine and we're using the same system whereas you mark stuff on properties on actors and stuff like that and then we extend it by having support for there's a lot of like complex saving on certain things and we wanted to have like support for to be able to like load any save whenever and be able to support that like no matter how much we update the engine and stuff like that should always be able to like load the saves that being said there are a few cases where we change game design a lot which can may happen where you might get stuck if you start loading old safes but yeah there's a lot of work that went into making the safe system work which I important it wasn't too involved in so I don't know that that Pacific's specifics but yeah the the amount of time we spent on it is just because we want it to be very very sturdy so that and it's it's not been acting up a lot or at all almost yeah it's been pretty pretty good well there the third person view I think we can confirm that there will be I think it's not in right now we had it at one point before we got rid of it and I think we're gonna reintroduce it but cannot confirm tonight what happened to the large to the Hadron Collider we saw in the UI video I don't know maybe so maybe it's not I just genuinely don't know yeah yep will they be underground subterranean areas of the map there there are caves but depending on the context I saw someone asking about what tools were using we're using visual studio we're using a real engine we're using perforce as our let's go version control yeah thank you Jesus I'm programmer I was like well how do you put stuff in the Bing where you use it for language it's great I'm on Linux okay will the move to have fixed obi time exclusive a permanent it is time exclusive it's 12 months a lot of people said or asked are we gonna be on steam after that again we can't plan anything right so when we say basically the answer is don't know and don't know is not know and it's not yes it is literally don't know we haven't thought that far ahead and we're not gonna right now probably whatever yeah said modes are confirmed how about mods for creating maps will that happen and someone else did house before are we gonna make new maps in the future I have no idea whether that will be a thing that's probably just too solid we don't want to think about that right right now yeah we can finish this one map and then we'll see if if we have the time and resources to make more maps and then as for and as for mods but there aren't people can make their own maps again that's probably something we tackle when we look at momentum will see that can be supported essentially that being said though like I've played this game for a long time I still haven't seen the whole map even I haven't I don't know I don't know my way around every time I go driving I'm just like [ __ ] where am i how do I get back it's it's so big and we've challenged someone to cut like they're like I'm gonna cover the entire map we're like alright try good luck yeah it's just not gonna happen it's just not gonna happen localization support there will be there will be localization support and we will do community driven localization so the community can jump in and and help us improve it which means we should TM be able to support like a bunch of languages basically whoever wants to translate that language gene I love this column is the plan it's a coffee stain yeah coffee stain also known as yeah yeah that's the way we do it any TLC's planned yo dude we haven't even released yet yeah I don't even thinking about it can we have some gameplay we're not doing gameplay today unfortunately we'll have something like video clips pop-up insures or not I get this Tiger there's some gameplay that's crazy yeah there's gameplay literally gameplay yeah hazards in the map yep what kinds exactly I don't think I should tell you we've had a surprise but yes there will be hazardous hello alphas not a scam text I forgot to remove trust us it's no scam the more we say that the more you'll believe is right yeah for Hannah is that an alpha key around your neck maybe like maybe it's the last alpha key it is the only real alpha key can you make custom cars trucks maybe if there are months if I buy an epic now and another platform later will the save files be compatible maybe good question hopefully yeah is the answer hopefully because I don't think save files are like tied to the server well maybe I don't know but no they're not yeah you can like load and save and send your save file to the host or whatnot and they can load it a stuff so it's not tied so but but saves like when you're joining someone when they're hosting it's their save file that you're playing on so it's not like across what you can call it like some games have where when some when two people play together they're both playing on their save file so to speak so if one unlocks something the other one also gets it that's not the case in satisfactory if you're playing as hosts and people are joining you you're you're unlocking stuff on the host side file Oh someone asked if there's gonna be free updates after the game is released or is it all going to be DLCs after the game is released to the public we will be doing free updates yeah because we're don't bug fixes we're gonna be doing for the balancing adding new features yeah basically so the answer is yes any plans for pvp nope cooperative play it's cool we like friendly like people yeah it's us against nature screw nature why nerd turrets like sanctum why do you need tarts in this game when they're sanctum yeah uh uh our director yeah the director of the game kind of answered this and basically it was just as we were developing the game and designing it we just felt we didn't need it no like it just wasn't necessary and and you know we had it in the beginning and even though we had it we still were like we don't need this and we got rid of it so I know that that might sound counterintuitive to some but there is like the concept of less is more sometimes and cutting things out can often be the best thing and I think that's what at least the director believes I I'm an idiot so I'm just down with that whatever if you really really hurts Therese your mots turrets menthe alright alright yes is caught style in line refocus on solo it's it's solo or caught there's no difference yeah you can play it single-player

> plugins are using are you talking about the game or a stream cuz I can tell you what plugins are using the stream you know what happens when you die you die you die in real life facilities the game use any luck step any concern for desync across a large map no there's no concern there are no D sinks ya know at the very least not from a large map now I think there are no D sinks I hope not yeah it shouldn't be right now what do you make your model such texturing with none of us a 3d artist but I'm pretty sure they just use like Photoshop in Maya maybe that brush yeah I think computer player limits we support for but we're not gonna put a limit so in you and your hundred friends if you have I don't believe that for a second yeah you were your hundred friends can join a server and it'll crash but if but we're not gonna help you there by all means just try it let us know let us know how it goes yeah yeah scream Capet we'd love to see how it dies yes so right now we're testing for four is four plays the recommended number not per se really honest with anything I mean it could be that you know you want to have people are looking for different things from the game some people really want to manage the factory some people really want to go out there and find resources that way cuz whenever I play with people I'm like I always like okay I'm gonna line everything up perfect and then someone's like I'm just gonna put this here and put this down I'm like mmm but it's not it's not straight though I'm person number two that shouldn't be straight yeah there was can i play as Kristen Stewart though we would welcome for anyone are there any difficulty adjustments when playing multiplayer I don't really think and that's it it doesn't really get easier does it not really it's a little faster I guess doesn't really get here though it depends on your ability to multitask and coordinate with your friends instead yeah I don't think it I don't think it needs it I mean the challenge in itself isn't really based on like difficulty because we don't it's it's just building something together yeah like that's what it's about feels like you can you can argue the same thing we're like you have one programmer it takes a month to do a task but you got another another programmer now it takes two months the more people you have the more you're probably gonna fight about how you pick your friends yeah that's my friends will there be co2 emissions and will affect the ecosystems no but we really thought about that we did yeah like different different types of energy winning and such yeah what could be more environmentally friendly not but it makes everything so complex yeah I mean it might be an issue we might revisit later but right now again there are more important things yeah exactly and otherwise hey months but will they be a founders plak plak plak will they be a founders pack with alpha access um we're not no comment yeah name maybe I don't know developer Diaries is that like developer sort of like more developer Hyatt like updates maybe you know the highlights bit like update videos like in here this is where the vehicles are now oh yeah I mean it could be good the the main issue with a lot of the content we have so many content ideas and we get a lot of content ideas from you guys as well but it's it's honestly just time that's the thing it's just not much time like as I'm I'm loosely a programmer and for for like the longest time last year I couldn't do any of it because I was so busy with community management and and even then I couldn't put out as much content as that's that just a taste of their quality videos yeah yeah exactly are you in a cinema yes we are you have a cinema here so we're in the cinema right yeah we're not spoil yeah not at all no it only seats eight people it's not that snow that big again pick your friends yeah with resource nodes are you going to run out of the one load fast and have to change nodes often we have like recesses that run out and resources that don't run out so it depends on like which one you use but generally no because it's already too much having to you know people want to restructure the factory anyways we don't want to force it too much sandbox mode available I assume this is what people also call a creative mode which I assume is just no limit for you know you don't need to what you don't need resources to build things you just build structures I I mean I assume that we'll have it at some point but we sort of thought about this before and basically no at least not at the beginning because in the beginning times we're gonna need feedback from people and if we have a create a creative mode where people just do any old [ __ ] then it's really hard for us to know what feedback comes from where especially when we need balanced feedback so so whether there's gonna be a sandbox mode or not you know we can't commit to that right now the címon gonna be the last boss yes
>

> how big can you make your factory I guess we can touch on optimization here as well yes sir so your factories can technically or theoretically be as big as you want them to be so it all comes down to a beautiful computer you have promising no but we're working hard on like optimizing the game there are a lot of factors that comes into it like first of all it's an open-world game which it's in itself is pretty taxing because you can't load everything at the same time because the world is too big so we're streaming like tiles or what we call and dance like parts of the of the world depending on where you are and then when you build factors all over the place there's optimization to handle when you walk away from this so they don't render or run unnecessary CPU time and where was I going with this we're talking about socialization there's also net code like how much when you were playing multiplayer also how much net net cohere sending and how much packets you're sending etcetera etc what was the real question though that was Dale I mean it was it was how big of a factory can you make yeah and so I think maybe one thing to touch on there is the like the instant splines for example yeah so like everything is relative and in the game so you can make like you can probably do a lot of stuff but there's there's a ton of like it depends is the boring answer because like when we talk about conveyor belt specifically like when you look at conveyor belts it depends on like what's visible on it and you know how they're placed especially that we were optimizing it so that we reduced draw calls as much as possible on the spine or on the conveyor belt specifically so that you don't see when you see stuff in the world it's not too taxing and then also like when you start stepping away from stuff that it's not updated as often so there's there's a lot of stuff we can still do right now for optimizing it but we build pretty big factories ourselves right now so yeah it's it's like it's a relative question I guess it is kind of hard to answer we've done a lot of stuff with optimization I think we still have a lot of a lot of like ideas so I yeah else we can optimize so and I think it's kind of cool so yeah talk about the game if it's totally broken and full of glitches is that the case how much percentage of the game is even implemented it's not really like glitchy I mean actually laying playing for yeah the people in the Alpha have very little like big issues with when it considers optimization and performance actually that's one of personal miss points I think yeah right now so it's been actually really good yeah it's pretty good in terms of how much money what percentage this are really a question we can answer not really percentage-wise no doesn't make much sense for us cuz because a lot of it can also be like depending on a feedback may change what we need to do it also and it's also not good aspect when you in production wise sometimes we don't fully implement everything like there are issues that we are aware of but we just want to like try it so like this there's a there's a few glitches that I know personally that I've like let like fix that right now because I know it's it I know it exists and I know how to fix it but I'd rather spend time on fixing something else that's more like what people want in the Alpha right now we are listening to a lot of what people are asking about like specific features are specific bugs that exist right now yeah that's what the Alpha is partly for yeah it's getting feedback mostly for Jase give me your sucks well a lot of people are retired yeah yeah you know what I can wear these for seven days and you get like seven day dirty socks oh yeah they're gonna go for a good price you just bid for it yeah it's gonna happen my socks I don't care I'll take your cash money for it are they going to be collectibles Easter eggs shrines to your previous game sitting around two different probably maybe good maybe I often do change her hair color oh I'm actually curious Lin stuff um I mean like it's changed here but it's just faded honestly that's all it is every couple months it's usually a little expensive so I just try saving money is there a height limit it's the skybox how high is the skybox sky's the limit very high pretty high we've had some people hit it just by like building directly up I know our our tester yeah he hit it and he was just like building underneath himself like like 30 40 minutes or something something like that it's ridiculous you're not gonna be able to factory that I challenge you yeah yeah yeah people have tried in performance might not be optimal up there yeah I think just all the tiles are gonna be garbage yeah where have you learned your unreal skills I mean obviously everyone has learned in their own time and way but you can also say when it comes to coffee stain we have used Unreal Engine since [ __ ] before coffee stain existed like so before coffee stain existed a few other people here did a UDK like mod or something which was sanctum one a demo for that and ever since then it's just been Unreal Engine for literally everything we've done so this studio has just been Unreal Engine so there's that and I think I don't know correct me if I'm wrong maybe you guys might also know about I think like even from the big very very beginning like this studio was founded on like a bunch of students who made a project and they wanted to make it in a real engine specifically and at the time they were like like you're not supposed to use engines so they they said okay it's fine if you're all artists like no programmers and I think that says a lot of Unreal Engine that they may like managed to make a game with that a single programmer in it and then after that that was like alright let's make something out of this and Chandon want to share with the class yes Jase make that smile from one month what's a THQ Dornoch acquisition that happened you already got at once I like the hash tag is there going to be survival elements to keep the player alive it would no no this is it's a management game it's not a survival game kinda he's like drink water no no no there's nothing there's nothing like that in a game you're just you're fine all the time magically don't find an explanation somehow how is huge THQ Nordic been to you guys in the project there you haven't done anything yeah will they be VR support sorry I didn't mean to just do that people have asked about VR support that would that was about like holy [ __ ] it's gonna be so much occult yeah and also again it's one of those there are more important things to do and it's not like a game that was built with VR in mind as well and when it comes to VR you need to you need to think about it yeah standard design principles don't work yeah on PRI developer fire before it's very different like it's a lot of things that work for for normal games design practices and even just art art styles or certain tricks that you use just don't work at all anymore and you have to find a completely different way to interact with it so you have to it can't use VRS a gimmick it doesn't really work it needs to be the whole game needs to be made with VR in mind yes otherwise it doesn't work I feel like it's the same principle it's like we want to make them like if you want to have multiplayer in a game you can I want to have that in mind yeah yeah so yeah otherwise it's gonna be a hassle to like start your like force it in because not only is it a like interaction problem with they are not problem but like we don't know the best way yet in general like how do you handle input and stuff like that but also from a technical side like do you need to optimize a lot for specifically we are there's a lot of solutions you need to have yeah in order for it to work so it was a lot of work and how spit slash Jace how do you divide work amongst the various programmers on the team we have I was gonna say why are you looking at me and I'm like wait I'm I'm kind of a special case which is just not doing me any saying that is not doing me any so we have our producers or producer which kind of have a good sense of what's going on overall in the game so they collect feedback from like how are the artists working or what are they artists working on right now with the program is working on right now I like all the different game development prints whatever so they tend to like gather information and talk to our talk to our leads in the various fields so like to talk to our graphics lead and our program lead discuss like what do we need right now what can we do right now what's important for our developers right now so that all trickles down to the programmers where we have daily stand-ups and planning meetings where we discuss like if you want to implement this how hard can be and what are you weren't like and then we get to work and then we talk about what are we working on right now so we have daily stand-ups where we discussed that and then yeah I mentioned the leads have their own meetings in in my case because I do a lot of community management stuff I can be out of touch with the programming that has gone on in the project at large so I tend to take on things that are independent from what other people do so I I have been doing the vehicle since the beginning which is has been a lot of work but but these days like when I was redoing the drifting there's no dependency on any other programmer for me to rework drifting for example so I've been doing a bunch of things like that and there's like we all we're not a lot of people in studio know like it's not a super big studio when you're five or so bit more now we're gonna be about 30 so like no programmer is really like you're only doing that code stuff or you're only doing AI stuff so we're all kind of like split we take we tried to like generalize as much as possible so that everybody can jump in and do stuff to it but obviously like some people have done like specialize and stuff for the game like you've done vehicles yeah I've done a lot of net code like you I should yeah you mentioned enemies earlier but now you say there will be nothing to worry about what's up I think from that you mean nothing to worry about in terms of survival was what we were saying I think what we refer to there is you don't need to drink you don't need to things like that sleep yeah but but the enemies can you know they can kill you yeah they can still get you yep they may seem docile but they are quick yeah especially in lizard eyes there's cold eyes murder can't trust him I just sorry all the alien birds out there yeah there was someone before who else are they gonna be NPCs that you get quest from blah blah blah no there's not that

> wait ready which one who is the funniest at the stand-ups well you're never there obviously me yep everyone else is dead inside for a herring on my jo excite yes it's fresh when I come in and they're gonna be like never thought we'd say this yeah they were like I thought it was bad before and that's nuts here so yeah yeah please come back how does it take to build a medium-sized factory I think that's completely relative depends on what you think it's medium-sized yeah there's that but there's also depends on your OCD when it comes to refactoring yeah some people don't get very far because they're like this isn't quite perfect I'm redoing my basic iron production or something all over again so like which is satisfying which is fine I mean that's a bad way to play I'm not like [ __ ] on that but it will take more time exactly it's kind of hard to know I love when you build a factory you abandon it and go somewhere else and and do the refactoring somewhere else and you come back to you earlier you like Oh God God Oh what is this oh no did I do this no let's purge it with fire yeah can I build as high as I want we kind of answered that before it's just up to the skybox but there's no physics that's gonna knock you everything yep any plans for stuff like blueprints as in like the factorial blueprinting no we answered that in a video once before basically you know it's it's a thing that we thought about as well but at this point no maybe we will I don't know we'll see will it be out of space in galaxies no how did you come up with the name Oh a satisfactory no no it was it it was a it was a big process yeah yeah and it took us so long it was like no it was like ironically no one was satisfied yeah it was like it was like two weeks before like the or like a month before the reveal or whatever his name right now like alright we'll just go as satisfactory I guess it's been the working title for so long everyone got used to it I guess yeah yeah it's the company as well I was one of the people who hated it yeah yeah I hated it but but I got I'm I think it's good now yeah yeah but I I was one of the people who's like no to bed it's a warm yeah it took me like a year it took us just maybe they gave and putting it out there but it's like did you get indoctrinated or did you actually get one over who knows you know they could have been some subliminal stuff or they put something in my water because it is a pretty big task to name again yeah yeah it is sometimes it's like you you make a game base up like a name like a funny name something but if ya think it's around me like it's like this represents us our soul our hearts our identity it's just crisis this Factory yeah it's not it's not amazing it's just it's it's fine it's also a nice thing that if we just get average reviews it's like above 50% it's a little going for yeah that's how high we yeah yeah we're getting a lot of questions that have been asked before like translating the game or when is released even though we didn't really answer that but we can't just keep going over the same questions over and over so sorry but you may have missed some of the vlog before and you can watch it again what's the entire thing I'm sorry yeah we have to move on to like other things as well yeah and like peer to peer servers are dedicated that was answered before for Hannah besides the starting Aires will there be random spawns in the release i legit don't know if that's gonna be a thing yeah at the moment no no spawns of resources what I assume that's a good like what is the context of yes I mean I guess either yeah maybe either resources have set locations that I can answer they part of it by their part of the environment we built them in that way but like considering player spawns was first far as I know no but is the question about how long we've been in game dev each person like personally I think next in the longest of us Lee I've been a game de force five six five years give or take like working full-time at Lee yeah if if we're talking working full-time almost exactly two years right there comes seven years I'm a newbie seven years I think for me this is my first proper project on this way so can we crush our friends with orbital drops like sanctums thank you style you can't you can't crush them stuff like that but you can absolutely drive your vehicle of your friends yeah yeah you'd be like it's a new mode of transport actually we do that sometimes yeah faster did you stand with someone else's vehicle yeah so like PvP it's well I got a good one for Hanna can you tell us your favorite place on the map and why have you done the day night thing yeah that's a good one favorite place on the map I mean if I wanna if I want to stroke my own ego I'd say I'd say the desert that's that's an area I've worked on the most but if we're talking like proper proper favorite place gosh okay I would say yeah deserts I just like deserts they're nice I like this area Lee there's a swampy ish kinda I made that well you made it I like I love this yeah that one's no cool just made that one good can you say my name really quickly it would make my diet date I'd rather die I thought you said could you say my name real quick it would make my diet like my diet no just kidding blood money to you man toy toy dude this is that's my tribe it made your day love away why I kept seeing like all the time we're a pair of glasses snoot why what's the deal of it maybe I think they you look like someone I think like someone I think they said something like that yeah what hmm how can I get the key to Hanna not what I didn't get it no I get it my key well not alpha key to your heart a surprise but I think you guys same yeah definitely bribery what happens to player eventually when they are run over by a friend in vehicle a cadence probably died if you probably probably can we say look what happens if you die with in terms of you in the very probably right of your inventory yeah sure you you lose it but you don't lose you can get it back yeah go back and pick it up yeah so it's it's yeah it's like dark so it's not like this game I wanted to make that joke but I like no I'm not gonna no I'm gonna how many items exist oh you like to greater than 1 greater than yes that's it's a lot of items basically yeah a lot of buildings did not count no it looks like Michael from Vsauce oh yeah some people were saying why is Michael from Vsauce Michael here I'm sorry that was probably pretty loud in the mic or maybe not oh my god yeah yeah I'm not gonna hear that ever gave me I can't wait to grow my hair back yet now yeah you better cuz you need a new disguise oh that's why them can sing glasses how many load levels you use that's a question for Simon like a bazillion yeah all is a print screen natural put it somewhere else that I can find it that was that I did good okay be on eBay with Jason sucks yeah available in steam in the future we don't know genuinely don't know there's we don't know when you die some up it what made you cut your hair because I donated my hair if you oh yeah I didn't notice I add like super long hair and then I cuz Hannah cut her hair and I was like yeah we had the same hair sighs so I got it and donate it to kids who have alopecia and I can't wait to dye my hair again because I haven't been able to do that because I want to donate my hair really so I can have LuAnn and like crazy here so I can fit in again yes like these my hair is fading I say not he's not part of the group man it's like even these shirts kind of Rob yeah I'm the black sheep the white red flash yeah yeah Doku gun room you can we doing mascara lease of 50,000 if Lord Simon allows it no but this is a good quest like things to lead into a lot of people saying why don't you send out more alpha keys why don't you just send it to everyone more people means more feedback and that will help and that's not all exactly true if we get too many people in we will get more feedback but there is such a thing as too much feedback and if we get too much feedback then we will not be able to wade through the noise and try to find what's important and fix things so that's kind of why we limit the number to something that is always manageable for us and we don't bite off more than we can chew the other reason is and this is a probably a bit too straightforward but ultimately the elf the Alpha keys and the Alpha is actually not for you it's for us to develop the game so I know like a lot of people say I've just been looking forward to the game just give it to me right it's like but we're like hang on we need to get the right people that we want the right amount and at the right time so sorry if that doesn't give everyone what they want but we're doing what's best for us so that the game gets as good as it possibly can be and there's also the aspect of first time plate like your first time experience you only get one of those so whenever we test stuff and we start adding news like that will change the first time user experience so if we gave the keys to everybody they would all experience the game at that point at the same time and then we wouldn't have the opportunity to address any of the issues that the first time experience that yes yeah so that's also one big thing why you might hold off on testing on some people so to speak you are one of the rescueteers to be LGBT friendly or at least open about it why is it so important for you is this to you for me it's important just because like I try not to especially on YouTube and stuff I try not to just like shove it down anyone's faces or anything instead for me as bisexual dude I like to just just be on the screen and just be there and then everyone just gets to know who I am and hopefully just gets okay with the fact that I'm not straight but and to me that that that's important and I know that the Institute entire studio is very much LGBTQ from yeah just just in general just very open-minded and very supportive yeah we've got a few we've got a fair few LGBT folks here yeah thinking forearm stance there on the Alpha keys yeah dude I'll always give the honest answer if I can answer sometimes I can answer though any timeline of when the NDA will be released well Jesus it'll be obviously dumb question some time before the Alpha is released but as I said kind of earlier that's gonna an announcement about that will probably be happening sooner than you think that's the best I can say but later than you hope let's make the same joke again all right sir on service we've answered that before sorry we're not I'm trying not to answer the same questions ever ever yeah where is Simon I don't know he's behind us all yeah everyone spin around three times and say Simon if you can save Simon appeared regretted oh that's why he's here now yeah I'm sorry I suppose it's actually Jason's fault yeah blame case any plans for harnessing mod life for your base listed ogres as pack animals over up which sort of touches aren't a question that other people have asked about Ken animals follow you around like pets yeah kind of like pets what do we say maybe if you try hard enough I think maybe if you buy him a drink first well as you could see in the basic gameplay / convey about gameplay vids I made you could pet that lose a dog oh he just got mad at me and ran away or it got him mad at me right away my tinder experience but but yeah that's check - real but I can say but yeah you can also follow you around it's possible but I'm not gonna tell you anything about it yep can you see you character third-person did we touch on this so we're not gonna have three together basically it's not supported now we had it before maybe we'll have it later mmm there you go what's the biggest bug you guys have seen so far I got a good one you do yeah go ahead okay oh this is a good one I like I'm thinking to turn him into a video it's an idea that we've had but people have been a little hesitant to show like you heard it here first folks but this is gonna be a girlfriend it was I hope I don't go on too long about this but it was with the vehicles and I had a test level with a ramp and if you drove up the ramp to a certain point and hit the brakes then the and and on the map that was a we tested these teleporters and I have no idea it was gonna happen alright I actually genuinely don't but we had these like test teleporters and there was one on the other side of the mountain and if you drove this vehicle up on this rent to a certain point and hit and then stopped it disappeared and drove out of the teleporter we're like what the hell is going on right and if you go in the vehicle and you stop it so like before if you stopped at me hop down with root cellar if you're in it you died and the game crashed and then we had no idea what was going on and we found out that it was triggering a plant later as well that was crashing and we had no idea what was going on and then we realized that I had added camber support which is to make the wheels do this and in one case there was a the possibility to divide by zero and so then that would happen put infinite forces on the vehicle the vehicle became infinitely as big and then it crashed right but if it went infinitely is big and it hit the teleporter then it overlapped the teleporter and drove out of it beautiful yeah that's a good one beautiful I love [ __ ] like that where it's like you have to smooth out what the hell is happening yeah it was bizarre yeah that was a hard one question for you what is the sense of humor / memes come from so natural we're pretty tired like yeah super boring at work yes you saw the THQ yeah really are the rest of it is alive yeah no but the the honest there's the truth is Carson's been like this since the very beginning I wasn't there from the very beginning but it's always been like that even if you look at so sanctum and sanctum 2 are more serious games but even in there there's like a lot of like weird Easter eggs like these Fresno horses floating around in this dark room it's like what the hell is that about has nothing to do with anything yeah but that goes in there right and then goat simulator happened of course it's just how we've been all the time and even if you think about goat simulator that was a game that had like a lot of commentary on the game industry and and like twitch bait and things like that as well as even Kickstarter you know it we sort of just turned everything into memes and so that's just kind of happening now as satisfactory or that's what I'm doing it's gonna happen whether you like it or not yeah it's pretty relaxed here well yeah we joke around a bunch me and Simon have the thing where we do this yeah are you watching Simon are you watching got him do that it was like I was gonna include this thing yeah in the will they be breakdowns of machines then you have to fix and repair good answer please don't firm that a rubber bone what the hell a rubber bum bum Oh what is their goats and satisfactory I don't think so it's that would be a fantastic goats speaking of these cards we have his tricks like already in yeah already mmm don't say yeah don't say any of them yeah yes sir yeah of course yeah no how much time have you invested currently in satisfactory it's like three years I'm invested I don't know how many hours it's like what if you play the game that you're developing as much as I feel like I didn't phrase that correctly what if what if you played any game as much as you played it when you're developing yes I didn't I was I was gonna say like you probably don't know we're talking about because you probably rate play more runescape than your entire life foot but like I mean I played a lot of inside runescape that Freudian slip yeah yeah I'm gonna say it's game here but I was but I meant good simulators but I didn't really played much outside of work I don't really satisfactory that much however if you play it like yeah yeah will there be any cosmetics available player colours uniforms well there is the ability to paint buildings and vehicles different colors can be useful for color coding sections of you factory whatever well just for aesthetic reasons someone did ask before if there's gonna be any sort of just purely aesthetic things that you can build like Windows whatever and there are some yeah I think there's gonna be more in the future I think what we're hoping yeah we're planning yeah III would really want it as well because I think would add a lot of value I think a lot of people would really love like putting a couch down yeah down a table like they'd make it look pretty that I think people would love that I mean yeah we're all for personalizing the you know Factory in the spaces but it all comes back to will they be jetpacks in satisfactory yes yep it's do the trailer it's in the trailer so I'm the site as well so how the alpha testers done any art using walls and paint gun well the way I'm not gonna say that actually but not I mean all right I don't I don't think so I think they've just made beautiful factories as you can see on the screen right now you know I think we have to wrap this up soon it's been about an hour even taking into account that we we're late you weren't late when you talk about it yeah we said we said 420 you're on 420 yeah we were on time on it and somebody in a year I'll be 12

> long-range transport one more good question go go go just one more quick good question then we're just gonna answer here's the best question so far can i play a civilization session with you Jace no one more good question pipes nut that's a bad question will it be terraforming answered that one control the support yeah controls we and do we end on control support I guess we do control support we have it right now I think I haven't tested anyway like yeah it's country I think we're gonna have it and we have had it all this time the tricky thing with keeping up to date with our control support is we keep adding features taking things out and remapping things over and over and then it's like it's like we don't know if this is gonna work the way we want we don't know if we want this menu or this button or this function or whatever and then then basically the control the support just falls apart because no one's kept up to date with it but I think when we get to specific milestones then the controller will be considered again and then tightened up and then because it's also the aspect of like when we add new features we don't want an SS able to be like because when you're when you're live with the game you have to take all things into consideration every time so like how does it work with control like control support so if we had a new feature we have to test it with like oh how does it with keyboard how does it work with control sport how does work with all these different types of controls you know stuff like that and right now we'd rather test features and like try them implement them and see what happens rather than try to kind of be tied back by those types of theö but there is some control support right now yeah but I'm not sure with the state of it supports it whether or not the buttons are mapped to the Google things I don't think I know that out UI the entire time had kept control of your mind yeah I don't know where that is now yeah yes it's still yeah UI at least is supported you program your side all right I think we're done yeah all right cool not looking at any more questions no closing the window even done all right well thank you all very much for tuning in I had a lot of fun hmm these guys did all right but yeah I think hopefully we're gonna be doing more live streaming stuff in the future yeah so we can have a more technical day at the very least this you know this was kind of a trial run as well to see what's it like live streaming interacting with you I think it went well sounds very fun you know yeah and we have some other live stream ideas as well which I say this and hopefully don't get in trouble for saying it but it may happen it may not happen yet but we'll try make it happen because it's a really good idea yep okay so thanks for tuning in yeah yep and I will catch you all later then we share the vaad paint with people yeah hopefully yeah thank you everyone
