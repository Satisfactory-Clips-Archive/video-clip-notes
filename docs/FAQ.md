> someone also asked about on religion five yeah are you uh all considering going to Unreal Engine five uh yeah something that we've considered and investigated and uh remains to be seen uh as to what we plan on doing with that but I would say that like a lot of the investigations we've done have been pretty promising so I think uh it's probably looking better than it was when this question was asked us like a year ago or something for sure especially now since 5.1 is out 501 is a bit more I think 241 is what 5.0 should have been in terms of stability but there's still a couple of issues with uh the new engine plus we would need to redo a lot of stuff in the game like I think we need to switch physics engine completely so like we had to redo vehicles from scratch almost not scratch but the physics would need to be which we which we want to do anyway so yeah it might be good

> wait there was a will you ever consider VR for satisfactory I think this is another thing that like sure to be cool but it's going to be really hard to prioritize like when there are bugs and other features that everyone can enjoy um but instead we spend the time to make VR work and work well I'm not sure so this is another thing where it's like we could technically have it there so you could technically have a VR experience but maybe the The Experience isn't really like tailored to VR super well so it's not that great but you can kind of look you know and that might just be gimmicky and maybe who knows maybe that's enough but I think if we want to make features for the game we do kind of want to make them fully fleshed out and that would be a lot of time I think into making VR which wouldn't really push the game forward it would only help some people who play with VR to have some good experiences so it goes back to the bang for our buck situation and it doesn't really seem like a strong bang for our book at least but who knows like like from us as developers working on yeah that's kind of true and it's like [ __ ] yeah I love VR and I just want to make up like the dopest VR game ever like if we had someone like that that would do it in their in their period of time probably I know that there are one or two mods that have come pretty far that are really good but I don't know if there's any like finished mod that really like fully functions um for VR yeah because I've seen a couple of demos but yeah I have seen yeah I have seen some videos on some VR in satisfactory so it is a thing who knows you could you could Google around find these people see if they have something that you can uh use you never know I could use more immersion yeah VR where you also need like three times better Hardware to be able to run the game VR games are [ __ ] like harder intense and then you play on Andrew say file and it's like you might as well look at a JPEG um have you heard have you heard that uh Evanescence song

> uh Json console release or phone okay so this is uh here we go this is a good this is a good clip Marv clip and ship this one um so as for console release or phone release at the moment we are focusing only on PC I don't see a phone release ever happening by the way um console has always been something that like I think we're interested in but there's a lot of things that um first of all we want to focus on PC because we don't want to get sidetracked with all the work that comes with um having your game Run smoothly on multiple platforms uh if we were to do that then development progression is going to start going really really slowly um so we're focusing on PC um the idea of having console is definitely something that we would like maybe it's a thing we could have in the future who knows but right now we're just focusing on PC another major issue for console is that we would have to make sure our UI works really well with controllers and stuff like that so again that's more additional time that we'll need to assign um to make things work that isn't going to be going into pushing the game's design forward and we have had this approach with our development of satisfactory where we really really really really just want to prioritize figuring out what we the game needs and making the things that the game needs um to get to the finish line so right now I think console is kind of taking a bit of a back seat uh but it could be a thing it could be a thing though PlayStation 8. yeah at least surely

> actually one piece of general info that I would like to know as well because I I saw this question and I don't know the answer and I think you answered on stream but that was the state of the uh miners Mark Z miners people are oh yeah the question that we get almost every single stream is uh what's the deal with the Mark III miners because you can only get like 780 items per minute out of the miner but the miner supports 1200 items per minute what's the deal like what's going on yeah so uh I I actually did I believe I followed this up this was the first follow-up that I did but we can do it again since it always comes up uh and that is that we do have a solution for the MK3 Miner output we do have a plan uh uh um yeah all I can say is that we we do have a plan so there have been many suggestions that have suggested make Foster belts rescale the numbers add a second output um so you know there's many things and and we have decided on what we plan on doing I just kind of tell you what we plan on doing I'm sorry I just can't um yeah but that also brings up the question about the uh pipe issue where it's like it's really hard to run 600 cubic meters of fluids through pipes right like they never run at that thing because there's like weird math issues and and things like that um so I also asked about that like do we plan on what do we want to do around that and so one option is obviously rescaling the numbers so that like the math will work with whatever numbers but also it seems like the interest is to find uh and fix the inaccuracy issues and keep the numbers as they are but we'll see how that goes we'll see how that goes interesting maybe it doesn't work because because the pro the thing that I Was Heard internally was that like here's the programmers on one side here's like the designers on this side designers like 600 the program was like that's not gonna work and then no we do it yeah yeah yeah as always the constant the constant push and pull between uh programs and design that's cool that's nice that we're at least gonna spend the time to to fix that because it could just be the case where like we just decided oh it's too much effort to look into it we just decide to change the numbers uh so it's nice at least that we invest the time into looking into it cool

> uh will we be able to mirror uh for example Refinery so we can finally get symmetrical mirroring setups this is something that you should definitely put in the QA site I haven't seen super big support for that internally at this stage but if you guys show more support who knows maybe maybe um I think it's I think it's a feature that if if you watch The Bugs video you'll you'll know that looking for good bang for our buck is really important and I think if we have an entire feature where you can mirror your buildings what we get for that is like a slightly more aesthetic build in some cases and nothing else but that's a lot of work and so it doesn't sound like a good bang for our buck in my opinion um and so I think that's a hard sell when there's other more critical things that are needed for sure but you can always suggest it if it's really really requested then maybe we can do it because if you guys really want something that factors into our decision making even if it makes a little less sense but if you guys are happier then maybe we'll do it

> uh will they be Ray tracing at some point I don't I don't think that there's a I don't think anyone's super uh pumped about and they've been having honestly um don't worry but it's just like uh yeah yeah I mean yeah you're right I mean pumped as in like but isn't something that he needs whether or not we can make it happen yeah that's that's what I meant obviously it would be kind of cool but it's it's only for very few people and it's not something that would necessarily change the game so much but who knows maybe it's like an additional option that we could just an experimental option that we could just introduce for some people who knows uh but you know you know how I sort of see it coming about so sometimes we have things like creative time where um people in the company they take an entire day to just kind of do whatever they want then it can be for satisfactory it could be for their own development who knows um and you know this could end up maybe even being uh who knows a creative time thing that's how I if it were to happen I see it happening like that for example if you think about the weather effects with rain that was a another one where it's like were we really ever gonna you know reschedule things so that we can get rain in the game not really but someone made it in uh Ben made it in Creative time and so now it's just suddenly a thing and we get rain now and so I feel like if Ray tracing is going to be something like that it's going to happen in that kind of way on like unscheduled unprompted

<details>

<summary>A transcript is available</summary>

> uh someone asked uh what is your take on mods I'm gonna on moderators and chat that's nice there's a video I made a whole I made a whole last video about that one oh [ __ ] I forgot that video yeah do we like the modding Community click that thumbnail 121. click it now that's that's a long ass time ago they're all right yeah yeah go check it out it's sometimes it's somewhat of a statement whenever we're like no we like the mods and people are like whoa I don't understand where this like anti-modding thing uh I'm on devs or maybe it's just like I missed him like yeah understanding well no I've seen no I've seen it around where there are developers who actively like shut down mods in modern communities this is a thing that like I've seen I can't nothing comes to mind right away or at least nothing that like there's obviously some situations where it's like if there's like competitive elements and multiplayer elements like I can this absolutely makes sense in many ways and maybe even in every way but um I think that there are some other games that like yeah because like GTA and I can understand GTA because they have a lot of issues with with cheaters and and stuff like that and I guess the way they see it is like if we Foster a modern Community then we also fostered that part of the modern community or something like that who knows who knows I don't know they probably they probably have they probably have their reasons and who knows maybe they're good maybe they're not I have no idea but in in our particular case uh we're all for it um I know that uh rocket League had before they were owned by epic they were kind of like open towards like no but there can be mods and and people can mod the game so long as you're not using the mods unless they're like cosmetic uh in like the competitive like section of the game so like there's there's training packs and stuff like that uh but then they change their minds I don't know if they they realize something or if maybe it was too hard to uh police whether or not people are using them in the right modes or or what well it's it's I guess it's because we're going to fortunate in that our game you know it doesn't matter if you cheat in our game like it doesn't really affect anyone but yourself so why should we police that uh but maybe there's just some insight that we don't have because we're in that situation or something the issue is that satisfaction doesn't have official mode support but other games do I don't think that's the issue I mean I guess if we had official mode support then maybe people wouldn't ask the question I suppose but I think there are many games out there that don't have official mode support that do allow mods or don't allow mods but even if we don't have a visual mod support we have developed the game with Mod support in mind Zim saying you don't understand you always say mods equals cheating and Community highlights true that's true no no it's fine there are mod managers it's true it really is it really really is anticipate there being such a good modding support for our game yeah we were like there's not going to be mod support until we officially support it boy we were wrong yeah what does official yeah what does official mod support mean what it sort of means is that we have like we develop our own tools for it and we distribute it somehow maybe integrate in the game somehow but so far we haven't done that and in part because the community has done it so well uh if we were to do it I don't really know how we even do it actually at this point like because whatever we do we would need I don't know I feel like we need to sort of build upon the community um because uh if you guys haven't if you guys haven't seen the mods you can go to fixit.app this is the I think this is the biggest mod or the only mod manager that we have I'm not sure but it's by certainly the the biggest um mod manager that we have and uh mod uh Repository and it's really cool it's just this little app that you can just pick which mods you want to install just install them yeah and there you go yeah however however PSA for people who use mods all right please remember this okay uh we do not officially support them and so sometimes if the mods haven't been updated to work with our game they may not work even if they haven't been updated work for the game the game may not work well with the mod we we cannot guarantee compatibility with every anything and so we get a lot of people who uh say hey the game's crashed um and they send us their stack trace and it's the other mod that's crashed this happens most commonly after major updates so I had a lot of this happen just recently after update 7 dropped a lot of people saying like suddenly my game won't start and it's because certain mods they had installed haven't been updated yet okay so if that happens if you if you have if you're getting crashes um and you have mods installed uninstall the mods via the mod manager okay don't just don't just reinstall the game don't just delete the files that you see uninstall via the mod manager okay because there could be other files elsewhere that's the only way to really do it um and if you do that then assuming your save file doesn't rely on the mods that you've removed the game should run should trademark yeah sometimes it's our fault too but like it's always funny when whenever we release something like 90 of the crash crashes that we get are from mods and and this not to blame them or anything like that because how how could they possibly have updated the mods knowing what we were gonna do with the game right but yeah but I mean it happens like with experimental right so there's that experimental period where anyone who has mods out there they've got a decent chunk of time to adjust their mods to make them work before it goes to Early Access but sometimes some people just don't uh or whatever yeah whoever created like the original Mod to also have time to to do it so it's not it's not like one it's not like the the modding Community fixes can't fix every mod it's like up to the mod Creator to maintain it as well exactly and yeah kivas is saying that happened to me I didn't but I didn't realize I had mods installed yeah exactly and like I've had people who um they they would say like I haven't played in a year I don't have any mods installed they probably don't even have the mod manager installed but they did have a mod installed at some point and especially if you don't have the mod manager and you're running the game via steam or epic like that that also means that whatever mod you had installed is not getting updated along with the game either so if you've ever ever had mods and you're getting crashes uninstall them via them on manager that's my uh my PSA big tip of the day yep and aruma here with great advice coming from The Sims Community I'm very used to hearing that you should turn off your mods after any new major patch there you go that would probably make sense here

> any updates on the new tutorial uh no no updates on no words on the tutorial last thing if we do that yeah it is like the most important part of the game is like the first uh uh like your first time user experience so like that's the thing you really want to be sure that the game is like finished and ready so you know like but but I doubt we'd put much time into it right now when there's new things that we plan on adding so we might want to do that yeah lost when we've got everything else in so that we know that we can explain everything well I think the tutorial at the moment is pretty decent pretty good so I don't think we're in too much of a rush but of course we should absolutely absolutely revisit it to make sure we get it as good as it can possibly be it's super important for new players because it's definitely um I was gonna say how did I forget what I was going to say the moment when I started speaking because because I don't feel like we've seen ambulance um I think the thing we also kind of want to check out as well with the new because we added new analytics system or no not analytics but metric system in the game because we want to kind of figure out like where people drop off as well so like maybe we we need a little bit data on like knowing specifically like where people get stuck in the game if they get stuck so like if we start working on a tutorial system before we know have that data fully established then we might be focusing on like the wrong parts of the game where we think like oh this is something that people don't understand but it might be something else that people will get stuck on so we also kind of want to gather a little bit more data on that thank you I know that like uh pipes and coal power was always a uh you should drop off point in the past hmfs oh boy God I'm still well oh my God I still have flashbacks when I try to go to sleep you get stuck at that point then you're already screwed like you you've gone too far

> another question uh so uranium fuel unit recipe requires beacons when are we going to change it to remove beacons uh so the message I got from you know internally is that as far as where you know uh we haven't removed beacons so you can still use it uh even though we're planning to phase beacons out eventually and so when we do remove beacons we do plan on adjusting that recipe um now obviously adjusting recipes can be a headache for you guys because it can really with your factories um uh but there is at one point there will at least be one other balancing update at some point and we don't do this all the time because we know it's really bad for your save files um so but we will add you know we will try to do it all in one update and we'll give you guys a bunch of heads up so that you can get ready for it and things like that and so when we do that this old recipe will probably get a change as well as we remove beacons but you guys will get a lot of heads up for that when it's going to happen we'll make videos we'll talk about on streams and even at that point still not everyone will hear it I'm sure it's because of that alt recipe that we didn't remove beacons originally completely because we could have changed that all recipe in the same like in the update where update six where we did away with the how beacons work on the map we could have gone away with the alt recipe too but then if it felt like oh if we just do it for that alt recipe that can affect a lot of different recipes and then we might as well just look at all the recipes at the same time instead yeah yeah it's it's not a it's not a really good reason to mess with your save files at this point just to remove beacons and when we say messages or save files to this day people who um who were even part of the closed Alpha before we launched their save file still load to this day so like we do we do intend to maintain compatibility the only thing is that if your recipe if the recipe has changed they will change in your buildings and so your factory will stop functioning but your let your save file should load that is how we've had it all this time and I assume we will keep continue going with that in the future I feel bad to break up the streak if we did that yep also I don't really see why we would have to but who knows maybe something will come up hopefully not though

> a way for faster Auto saves uh right now there's no way for there's nothing you can do to make a lot of saves faster they just kind of depending on what your build is um but in terms of us making Auto Sales quicker we do what we can to you know we always try and revisit that and um optimize all areas of the game and Auto Sales is one of them I think maybe when we get safe if we get save files like Andrew's one or something like that maybe we can look into it and find small ways to optimize things but at the end of the day there's only so much we can do especially with a game where you can build infinitely so

> past time of day by sleeping in Hub I don't think that's something we're gonna add I think that's something that people have brought up before and I didn't think anyone at the office once to include that because it it sort of undermines the game a little bit um I guess we could have it if because the people there's two reasons people did it right or requested it one was night time was too dark but if night time's too dark or too problematic we should just find solutions to make nighttime not problematic then you don't need a passing time of day feature another feature is another reason is because you could do that and then things could build up and then you know you just need some items and you can just like Fast Track the time right but that undermines the game so those are the two reasons that I've heard about time of day stuff yeah

> any idea uh how high of a priority it is to fix the smoothness of driving on foundations so we've talked about vehicle updates um uh before there will probably be no updates to Vehicles until we we intend to do like an overhaul of the vehicles and we're probably not going to be putting any time into fixing anything until we do that because in order to do that overhaul we're going to be undoing the work we would do in the meantime um and you know there's an argument to be said that we should do that first so that it's better in the meantime but we'll see um the the thing is my so the my understanding of that particular issue was something that I ran into when I was working on them way way back when uh and what it is is that like there's when your wheels are driving there's a ray that gets cast down to find the ground to see where it is on the ground and now sometimes they're between foundations there's actually a tiny tiny Gap now the Gap is imperceptible but the ray is a one-dimensional ray it has no width that only has a length and so we can slide in between those gaps and so when it does that it says that the wheels are you know in it no longer on the ground in a weird different state and so that can cause the wheels to do something strange um so so my understanding is that that issue comes about uh when driving on foundations because of that Ray doing funky stuff between foundations that's my understanding of it now there's a fix for that which is to not use a single Ray but instead to use a sweep of a shape so that it actually has a width um and a depth so that like it can't fit between those gaps the problem with that is that it is not very performant uh so it was that was that that was in there but that was removed uh in an effort to um in an effort to optimize the game so I don't know I don't know if we can just put that back in or if uh you know when we do overhaul things we can make things better so

> uh other plans to reduce more cause and effect to the game so I um I feel like there should be consequences for abusing this pretty little planet yeah right so uh there was like I know in the very beginning of satisfactory there was the intention that um you know like if you build like a lot of stuff it will affect the environment and that might screw with things maybe create like bigger monsters or whatever and then we ended up scrapping that very early I think just to sort of simplify the game I think that the interest for that is probably one where most people are probably like yeah that would be cool but I think it's also something where we I think it's gotten to a point where it's also something that's just not as important as other things like it's one it's it's a cool feature but there's a lot of features that would just be cool but what is the game what do we think the game absolutely needs to get to 1.0 and I'm not sure if we think that environment stuff um matters uh for a 1.0 release uh yeah that's kind of where I think it lies right now

> could there be some uh creative or cheats most likely so with in Update 7 we've added the ability to support game modes and with that came uh like passive mode or the retaliation mode where uh creatures won't attack you unless you attack them first or the default mode where they're you know aggressive creatures are aggressive um and that's the groundwork for Creative for uh game modes in the future and I think a creative mode is a very obvious one and I'm 99 sure that that's something that's going to come but it's it's something that we don't we we haven't wanted to work on um through the majority of development because we don't we don't necessarily want to encourage everyone to easily go into creative mode I know some people go get mods anyway and they can get something like that and that's fine if you go and jump through those Hoops to do that but we don't want to just give people a button to turn on creative mode if they're frustrated with the normal mode because we want you to be frustrated with the normal mode if it's frustrating so that you can tell us so that we can make it less frustrating you know what I mean so if we give creative mode too early we may miss out on a lot of feedback and I know that maybe comes at the cost of maybe the fun for some people so like who knows maybe it's a good decision maybe it's not but that's just the justification yeah but uh creative mode is is an obvious uh an obvious game mode I think that should be added personally

> is there a possibility to get first-person cameras and vehicles for me the third person always kills the immersion uh possibly I think there's a chance the thing is Vehicles will probably get reworked um at least under the hood I don't know if their functionality in game will change but they're likely going to get some work done to them and I think generally what we do is we try and if we're going to rework something then we just we save all the work for it until we dive into it so I since we have plans to rework vehicles I doubt we're going to do anything even with the camera if we do it at all um but I doubt we'd do anything with the camera until we dedicate time to the vehicles as a whole

> will there be a way to make use of post 780 parts per minute for MK3 miners so that's something that we will address at some point yeah we will address that at some point that's my understanding yeah um any plans over 1200 Min per minute belt or Miner uh probably not so as I was saying before we get Precision issues as the number of uh units in the through port throughput or like that are being generated or sunk or or even fluids right when these numbers as these numbers increase we actually like mathematically and not just mathematically but like they're just technical issues and like limitations that start to uh cause issues and so I think that if anything if anything uh there might end up being a point in time where we scale down everything just so that we we don't have to deal with that technical limitation so much anymore and you guys can have more Precision but like in a relative sense right so it will still essentially be the same game it's just like list numbers um and then so if I take your question then like is there going to be a 1200 per minute belt or is there going to be a foster belt uh uh maybe if we can get around these technical issues that could possibly be floating Point Precision issues yeah so it is floating Point Precision issues that's one part of it but it's also like the other issue is also like um the way now I don't know this I'm trying to think of this if I can get this correct but it's also a matter of like when you're how many how many items gets processed per frame right now if if we if if there's like if you're you've got items zipping through and in one frame they're supposed to be like six items that go into a building because maybe I don't know you have a low frame rate or there's a spike in at this one moment or if if the uh the the belt is so obscenely quick that that happens accounting for all of these different like movements within the factory uh in the factory tick can be really tough uh I think I think you can only actually do the way it is you can only do like one at a time or something like that and then I think we have to then simulate frames to make up for it if there's like a one long frame I don't know all this like weird so it's it's not just the floating Point position issue which I think is there as well but it's also like how do you handle if there's a lag Spike or if there's just low FPS and there's a lot of uh um items that get you know produced or sunk into a building how do we handle that on conveyor belts or split or merged how do we handle that like completely accurately right because you guys you guys will know if there's like a one percent sway you will notice it in your factory won't you you will like your power will go out or you know buildings will be like backed up like you will know it it so it really needs to be really really really precise like 100 of the time otherwise you will feel it in your factory and that's that's a very hard issue to solve especially on like computers where frame rates can be variable and all that kind of stuff so Update 7 was a huge Improvement on your lag and lag spikes that's good to hear the math yeah it's a it's a combination of like math and just like like algorithmic logic kind of you know it's like how how do we handle it how do we handle it what do we do there should have been 10 items that went into this building what do we do how do we calculate that

<summary>A transcript is available</summary>

> what's your stance on terraforming and do you plan for update 809 my stance I'll give you my stance on terraforming right now are you ready I don't like it well the uh terraforming as a feature I think is an interesting feature in games I don't think our game needs terraforming uh I don't think we can add terraforming to our game um I don't think I don't think you all the same terraforming in satisfactory I'm pretty confident in that um but I I genuinely don't think our game needs it like I I made a video about this people made fun of me like what our game is and game isn't right but like uh one of the points that I made was like just because you can imagine a good feature right in a game and I think like if we could imagine satisfactory and there was terraforming it would maybe be a better game right it would maybe be a better game but just because like there is a feature you can add to your game that would make your game better that doesn't mean you have to add the feature and it also doesn't mean you're actually lacking something uh because there's a million things that your game can be like a million there's an infinite number of things in fact not even a million a billion maybe even a trillion things that can be in your game um so and it's really really easy to see things that are like hey this could be cool and so terraforming is one of those uh terraforming could absolutely be cool it might cause more headaches than it's worth um techno technically speaking I I don't see how it will be possible at this point and design wise I don't think the game needs it I don't think it needs it it would be so much work for something that probably isn't needed yeah if we could snap our fingers and it'd be in the game and all the user experience issues and the knock-on effects of adding terraforming could be solved maybe maybe it would be good but yeah could add map editing instead I think map editing would be uh more doable than terraforming but I I don't know what the plan is for I don't know if there's going to be any map editing maybe maybe like some ability to expose map editing for mods or something who knows maybe that could be a thing in the future I'm spitballing ideas I'm not saying we're doing it

> I played this game a while ago but never installed it as I'm waiting on control support how is it doing uh there's probably been I think there's been no progress in control of support and I'm still not entirely sure on what the official stance is going to be on controller support uh I think if we could click our fingers and have control support we would want it um for the longest time we did have control support in the very beginning and I think to some degree there is some control of support but there's not a lot of thought that's gone into it um but we didn't want to do it because we thought the game is changing a lot a lot of things are being added we don't really want to keep revisiting control support every single time we do something because we want to focus on getting the design of the game done and getting the features of the game that that are needed in um but then now at the stage I'm not really sure where we stand like I I don't know if the planner right now is well when all that's done we'll get the control support in or not uh I think if we can have control support of course we would want it there's so many good reasons uh you know some people just like control support but also for accessibility reasons controllers can be really good for people too and so it would be great if we can do that but it all comes down to uh you know the planning and prioritizing features and I'm not sure what what the you know the plans or the intention of the team is uh on the on the front do people play it on Steam decks okay I'm not sure does people who hit plays satisfaction steam deck does anyone play Satisfaction on Steam deck you do I do okay that's pretty good

> just want to have Road pieces again we've actually worked on road pieces way way back when and I don't remember why we stopped working on them I don't think it's an impossibility that we'll have them but also I'm not sure how high prior they are at this point in development it might be a bit tough to get them in uh over other features but at the same time especially with blueprints people are making some really good stuff when it comes to roads they take a bit more effort there's you know they're not like dragging and drunkness well they are when they're blueprints but you know they're not like easily buildable like conveyor belts or something are uh but these look really really good and in fact this was made with blueprints um I think there was someone on either the last stream that we featured we may even or maybe it's two streams ago he was making all these like Highway pieces in blueprints uh and yeah so I think there's been like a lot of good work when it comes to roads and blueprints how often do you make zero mistakes I have never made zero mistakes not even once

> uh I have two canons a desired game design uh yes and no it wasn't intentional but uh it's not something that we want to remove uh for the most part we're pretty happy with it we think it's really fun uh it's also not free right like you do actually have to like hook up and power many different hypertubes to make it happen so there's like there's a little bit of a price that you pay but it's also just kind of really fun and I think we're kind of kind of cool with it that's my understanding

> but adding the ability to build a cover on belts that you could build onto finished factories belt uh belts help performance um people have asked this since since like day one actually um and I think I think it might it like maybe in some cases but uh I actually think that yeah I'm not sure it's something that we've not wanted to do and part of me wants to say and I don't know if this is correct or not but part of me wants to say that like the rendering of the items on the belts is not really necessarily the bottleneck I think because we've done some really clever stuff with the way that we instance the items on belts so we actually draw them in very very few draw calls and stuff and so like if I if I remember that correctly um and that like a lot of the bottlenecks come elsewhere from like other buildings or from calculating things in the background like the game uh the game itself is actually as far as again as far as I know as of now it is CPU bound so it's it's uh it's it's more like all the calculations that happen for like what's going on in your factory is what holds things back more often than not um yeah

> in the ETA on 1.0 yeah we just talked about that with uh with Stefan our CEO we don't have an ETA uh uh that was a joke um no we don't have an ETA like we the the problem for us still and this is something this has been a thing that's been going on for a long time like almost a full year now uh where we have a hard time deciding sort of what the what the final release of the game entails if that makes sense like we it's so hard for us to say like okay these are the features we must have from 1.0 and these are the features that we should have for 1.0 and like there's a little bit of like okay but if we want to release 1.0 in a timely manner we might not be able to do everything so like what must we have for the game and what can we maybe do later after we release the game you know it's those type of discussions that we're having and um it's it's really difficult because like for for us a lot of things sort of have always felt like this is a must-have for the game but then when we think about it's like but is it though maybe not you know um so so like there's a bunch of things that we kind of fluctuate back up like back and forth a little bit like whether or not we have to include it or not um and I obviously can't give you a list of that because we haven't decided on that either so um yeah that's sort of why it's so hard for us to to figure out when we think we will release the final version of the game but it's not going to be this here I can tell you that much

> whether we are satisfactory oh sorry I read that wrong I read it as in Swedish so it's like cheese I'm like what do you mean cheese why would we add cheeses that is actually uh vinyl so maybe maybe for 1.0 maybe it'd be like a special edition kind of thingy we might do something like that I don't know that's that's something we definitely thought about doing but I don't know if we'll actually we'll do it but that would be cool I think um because part of the reason why we haven't put out the soundtrack yet is actually twofold but one of the major reasons is because we haven't finished the soundtrack so like there's still more music coming to the game um so yeah when we release the game and we finalize it then maybe we'll be finally able to put out the the soundtrack for it would be dope would be dope biggest teaser months new music coming I feel like we've said that since the launch of the game though I had a wrap that's definitely a thing

<summary>A transcript is available</summary>

> DLS is satisfactory so DLS s dlss is not planned at the moment because we haven't seen any uh reasonable like reason to do it because the thing with the LSS is that it improves the rendering time or like it it fakes rendering like it it low it unloads rendering time off the GPU but the game is CPU Bound for the most part so it wouldn't actually make a huge difference um so so we haven't really seen a huge advantage of having that and also if you have a GPU that can support dlss then you already have a GPU that's well within reason to be able to render the game like rendering isn't a heavy portion for satisfactory this is It's the CPU bound game um so if your course are maxed then or like if your CPU is Max then like having a faster GPU won't actually increase the the render time uh not even my save I mean I'm not sure but there's a bunch of issues too with um with uh like the way we do rendering as well where the LSS wouldn't really work because it can't actually do proper proper Magic so we don't really we don't really think there's going to be any good gain by implementing it at the moment

> there it is I was like I didn't get a single question about turbo fuel for jet packs to stream it has it really been a stream if there's no question about turbo field for jet packs uh the answer to that question is maybe in the future because the issue isn't necessarily that okay I'm gonna give the full answer like because I don't want to just dismiss someone for asking that question but because it is it is a valid question and I actually don't care if people ask the same question every time because how are you supposed to know that it's your first time asking the question unless you know naughty naughty but um we would like to have it so you can have uh um plutonium fuel rats we would like to have it so you can have turbo fuel engine in your jet pack one idea that we had uh that we've been throwing around a little bit and maybe we'll do it maybe we won't I'm not saying that this is what we're gonna do but there's definitely like there's definitely room to have the possibility to have turbo fuel for jet packs and one idea we had was that uh maybe we could make it so that you can unlock the jet pack a little bit earlier than it you can right now but it's like a significantly worse jet pack than it is right now and you use the packaged fuel for the worst version of the of the jet pack and when you make turbo fuel you can use that and it will work the way that jetpack works today in the current iteration of the of the of the game uh that's one idea we don't know if that's actually going to work or not because there might be some balancing issue uh but that's that's that's one thing we were thinking about um so yeah it's already terrible well get ready to go it's gonna get a lot worse if we do that so yes

> the rebound Scout for update seven um good question actually that's a good question no I don't think so uh maybe I don't know it this goes this goes back this goes back into like a little bit of like we're we're sort of trying to figure out when we can release it and what we can do in that time and you know if we feel like it's it doesn't make sense to to uh to release it at a certain point in time then you know maybe we'll be able to do more if we delay it or whatever and it's also something we're trying to figure out like or maybe it's more important for us to get this next update out so that we can work on the next thing so that's also something that we're trying to figure out so it's our I like we haven't fully decided yet you know actually what goes into this update and the rebalancing is one of those things where maybe now but also maybe later down the line uh so it's it's I don't think it will be a huge rebalance in update seven but I might be wrong because development is a fleeting thing so maybe we'll have time for it or maybe we won't but I doubt it at the moment uh let's say yes

> ever thought of making twitch integration in the game we have um actually thought about that the the problem with twitch integration is that um I think it would be pretty cool and I I and I I wish we had a better opportunity for it because I think we could do something really interesting because I think I think a lot of games that have twin certification are pretty stingy about it and I don't understand why um but the problem with the game is that like it's very easy to cheat stuff so like if people are watching and they get coupons or whatever then they could they could get coupons some other way so like maybe it's a fun thing as a bonus on top of that um but I think it would be cool to have like you know twitch integration where like you can spawn like maybe enemies or something like that or you know the ones where people make it so that you turn around and dismantle something or like that I think those type of integration uh things would be pretty cool um but yeah the hard thing is just like valuing like what what's worth doing um but if people have ideas please post them on the QA side uh and let us know uh what you would like to see like twitch chat on signs and stuff would be also be cool so we've definitely thought about it but it's always like either we work on that or we work on um something else you know like it's it's always like a question of like what do we spend time on

> maybe but i think okay so here's the thing um i think our game is at a point where um like when you reach tier seven right now there's so much complexity and i i feel like at this point it's so hard to expand on the game where it feels meaningful if that makes sense like we're sure we can make it more complex but right now the game is really complex so if we want to add more then we need to like take the what's complex right now in the game in tier seven eight and like take that back a little bit because i think i don't think anybody wants to do you know face was phase four phase five you know that and the next thing right or maybe i mean some people probably do but i think for the game as a whole we need to sort of figure out a good um

> [Music]

> like end point where in terms of complexity and like how much you need and stuff like that um so so yeah on the on the notion of adding more machines and stuff like that i don't know if that is off the table i think there might be some ideas but it's so hard right now because we need to figure out where we put that and i don't think we would want to like extend from like we wouldn't add more tears at this point i'm pretty sure um so we'll see we'll see i i generally also don't know if we have like maybe we do have plans for new machines but i that's just like my my feeling right now is that like i don't quite understand we where we would put that if we did add more machines uh or you know new parts or stuff like that i it's so hard because like what is it what is where where do we expand the game from this point you know

> some kind of automation for biomass new not planned we we're I think we're gonna we're sticking quite firmly with that like the the whole point of biomass is that it is supposed to be annoying it is supposed to be like leading into the automation automation part of the game it is supposed to sort of teach you that by being annoying um like in the grand scheme of things like the the vast majority of the game you're not going to be using biomass at all anyways so it's also like kind of unnecessary to automate that too biomass only challenge do it Molly do it I dare you do it was that the biomass struggle the coal appreciation wouldn't be a thing that's that's I think you know that's how we feel I realized that not everyone agrees with that but I I think that's a huge um that that is a that is a big thing for us like the the fact that you do appreciate Cole more when it's been so annoying to use biomass golden cup biomass only oh my God you need to like hire someone just to run it and collect biomass so you can work on the rest of the factory like at some point I feel like you need so much biomass that uh unless you farm creatures you you do get a lot of biomass from creatures I feel like

> will the game end if we complete the story or can we play afterwards pretty sure this is my guess but pretty sure you're gonna be able to play the game afterwards i think story is gonna be it's not gonna be like take the stage so to speak i think when we add story to the game it's going to be like a like a side thing it's not going to be the game isn't going to be like the pacing of the game is going to be controlled by the story i think the story more so is going to be like a like a yes a side side chick the store is going to be a side chick for the game okay like you because like i think the ambition is you're gonna be able to play the game without playing the story at all and you're still gonna sort of get the experience that you're getting today yeah you can ignore the story i'm pretty sure that's that's what we're still so here's here's why i'm like hesitating on that is because we've been changing internally a lot about like how how the story works and like how it plays into the game we've been going through so many iterations of like what the story is and how the story plays into the game so you know it's still pending pending to change but i think i think that's still our stance that like you can completely ignore the story if you want to

> plan the dedicated server will fully support multi-threading technically dedicated already support multi-threading it's the fact that like the game can't be more threaded than the game is you know like you can't you can't just add more threads uh to a game and expect it to run faster like sometimes it can actually get worse the more thread it gets so we have we have made the game as threaded as it can be there are i think there's some bug on like linux dedicated servers where it doesn't actually use any more thread than it already like allocated so it's only running on one thread which is with that is a bug but i think we solve that um but if you're noticing that like oh it's using a bunch of threads it's not using every thread then you know you're running as many threads as you can right now essentially

> and I buy the music um we want to put it on like Spotify and stuff like that I think like one part why we haven't already put the soundtrack on Spotify is because the soundtrack isn't finished there's still tracks to be to be made um we could still put it out and put like uh DLC Packs to the the soundtrack I think we want to put it on Steam and stuff like that if people want to purchase it so that is definitely something we've planned for a long time to do but uh just we yeah haven't got around to it there's also a bit of Licensing things I guess that we have to like sign contracts and stuff like that so it's it's like a it's like it's a it's a process but uh the the idea is to have the soundtrack available at some point

> what is your favorite biome so far boy i mean my favorite biome is always the latest one because like i i i can see myself improving every time with like how how i build things or just like sometimes i have this thing where i i don't necessarily like something for what it is but for what it could be if that makes sense uh when i see like the potential in a place or or like oh like all these things that i sort of still have in my mind layered on top of it that changes things too but like i mean i really like how this spider coast turned out i'm really proud of it um i'm i mean northern forest's the same thing like i don't know like it's it's all cool it's yep we talked a little bit about this before too like when we were comparing the different clips here and between the the uh rocky desert and the uh spider coaster you just tilt the camera to the left here not tilt wait it's roll whatever no it's not roll whatever um how like the cliffs the way we're doing clips now looks different compared to how we used to do them and they're like ah do we go back and look at the uh change all the clips again but then once we do that we're going to change it again pan is not the term i'm looking for chat by the way i see a lot of people say there's a lot of a lot of terms that people always use like pan and stuff like that where it's actually not correct i can't remember the actual term whatever um no it's not swivel there's there's a fancy diagram for like filming um
>

> i cannot remember everyone just uses pan like just pan left i was like all right that's pen exactly the movement is part of it too uh so yeah we just never never stop working on the game i guess no yeah that's the that's the risk too right like you're never really done uh you just have to decide you're done at some point and then that's that's your limit because you could always always make something prettier like there's a lot of work i'm doing on the sparrow coast that i'm i know that i can i can improve it and i can make it better but kind of like we talked about earlier like that that 20 improvement would take me the same time as working on this entire area like again right it's just not worth the amount of time and effort for the the small amount of gain even though i know it's possible it's not uh there's other sacrifices too like doing not for sparkles means that suddenly sparkles is gonna be so beyond quality-wise the rest of the map that the rest of the map is gonna kind of suck in comparison right that's something that you also have to keep in mind like we don't have time to upgrade every single area to the same exact level we just have to kind of keep it uh the moment you like improve something above and beyond the rest you kind of start needing to improve the rest as well so you shoot yourself in the foot again it's like like eternal improvement cycles right uh because you want to sort of equalize the level of quality across the entire map and like i i'm absolutely already pushing that and shooting myself in the foot with that with this kind of stuff because like also because like i've learned so much ever since i started working that like you know everything i do like i want it i want it to be better and i want things to be nicer but not i shouldn't always do that right you have to keep things consistent too yeah stop getting better hannah yeah yeah yeah it's like oh no before i uh go mad with power you know or we just work on the game forever i guess that's a big problem

> will we ever be able to equip all the equipment at once i don't think we'll be able to equip all equipment at once because it kind of breaks sorry i was asking yeah so no i don't know if we'll ever make it so that you can equip everything at once because it was sort of goes against some of the design principles that we have for the equipment system but we do want to make some changes to the equivalent system we're not quite happy with it how it works right now uh the fact that you can't equip the hover pack and the hazmat suit at the same time is a it's a pretty big oversight on our part and we will sort of we we are looking into solutions as it has to like fix that if that means that we'll add a new body slot or that we completely revamp the equipment system and make it different i can't say for sure because we haven't made any decisions yet so we will see we'll see

> is there a road map posted anywhere not necessarily with release dates or targeting things uh but more larger if you have game features and content no there isn't because uh ultimately they're unreliable and if we can't put a reliable roadmap up there's no point in having a roadmap and when i say like unreliable like even features that you know if you asked us what features we were going to add this year last year that's already changed so it's like there's no point in us especially with features like we definitely wouldn't have want to put a road map up last year saying features x y and z are going to be added only for us now with more information as time has gone on we come to realize that we don't want to add those and then remove them from the road map and then feel pressure to have actually added those things because we said that we would add them so roadmap is really really not a good idea for us it doesn't really work for us the way that we work at all i understand that it can be useful for a community to have a vague idea of what's going to be happening but if we can't give you that accurately there's no point in giving it to you yes i feel for sure and you know when it comes to things that like make sense for you guys to know in advance such as like oh if you're gonna add a signalling system to trains then you know that like you're gonna need to like rework that in the future like that kind of information we try to like put out as much as soon as we can once we feel confident that we can put it out um but uh yeah maybe not a roadmap but a page that have a lot of brainstorm ideas okay so like we like we have something like that and the thing is first of all one there's the qa site which is almost that which is insanely big all right and ultimately like cool there's there's ideas there but it doesn't tell you anything about what we're gonna do we also have one internally that we use which is almost as big as the qa site which again we could we could put that in front of you but that's not gonna tell you anything about what we're gonna do that's just a bunch of ideas so it's it's not actually it's not actually useful yeah

> increase object limit when so uh never we can actually say that for sure because the object limit isn't something that we've set this is not something that we can control either because it's something that is part of the engine um and you know the engine isn't really intended to be used the way we use it um it's it has to do with how the memory is managed uh in the engine and like you can sort of up that limit using config files and that's been possible ever since day one but uh the problem is that like there's no there's like you're kind of like losing out on safeguards when you do that so like a lot of weird things can happen memory wise if you start you know changing that number uh because that is a theoretical limit um so like there's been people reporting that like they've had their save files corrupted or you know like weird stuff happening factory logic not working the way they should um so it is always recommended that we don't change that we are however working on improving the game so we don't have to use as many game objects now a game object isn't the same as like an object that you place in the world it has a memory object specifically so like if you place a constructor for instance it used to be that a constructor was like maybe 16 different game objects and now it's like down to eight and i think there's plans to improve that as well and like maybe not specific for the constructor but like for a lot of different things we are constantly working on improving the memory footprint of the game and uh i believe recently we've been working a lot on like the environment to like kind of get down the memory footprint on that and like how we manage loading the environment and stuff like that um so um but we can't really change the the like the u object limit the unreal object limit uh that's set by the engine

> did you consider docker support for dedicated service yes docker support is is common um we we have we had to shift uh like work load a little bit um so we were unable to work on dedicated servers uh for a little bit but we are like as soon as we can sort of get those resources back if you will it always sounds shitty when you talk about people as resources but i mean that's how it is sometimes like not that the resources i mean that that's how you talk about it anyway once those people can work on dedicated service again then docker images is like the thing we're gonna be working towards so we haven't uh skipped it we're just like we have delayed it in in regular fashion

> why is mac supported four and not six or eight i'm not asking for more but four seems low especially considering the 128 event so i mean i i mean you know it could be whatever but we have to sort of then balance the game so that it works for that many people right so we we if we officially support eight then in all of our design and everything that we do and the technical side of things everything we do must then maintain that so like i i i'm yeah so like i think when we go with four then that's just kind of the line that we drew so that when it comes to balancing when it comes to technical stuff we know what we're aiming for yes

> fixmas is my favorite time of the year there's been discussions about more events like this and so would be more likely post launch we have talked about other events um we said last year that we were going to look into more events look how well that went uh we will always have fixmes at least i don't think like i think the problem mainly is that we we're quite ambitious uh the people that work at coffee stain are really ambitious we always want to do a lot of things but it always ends up that i think a lot of that ambition goes into the major updates that we've made so far and i don't know like we've always wanted to do more events we have support for more events in the like the the seasonal system that we use to like trigger this kind of stuff that is support for many more events uh stuff like that so there's always the possibility for more events and i think it's going to be like if we get around to doing something then we'll do it but right now there's no talk of anything else but i guess that's because we're so still kind of wrapping up fixmas because we haven't finished fixmas even so it's not impossible but you never know

> i miss it jason i know you can't say but do a cartwheel if you can confirm sweet signs in update 5. the problem here is i can't cartwheel of course so like it doesn't matter it doesn't matter like whatever i do it wouldn't be considered a cartwheel anyway even if i was trying as hard as i could to confirm it if it was true was it was it confirmed or or like confirmed it the other way either way right oh okay so i could try cartwheels i can confirm one way or the other if science is coming in update 5. uh yeah by falling by falling or something yeah um somersault is acceptable oh yeah somersault still counts harder if you fall flat though right is it harder because like a somersault is like a flip isn't it like a is it like a backflip or something no that's a backflip somersault is just like jumping and turning your body or something i don't know just i don't know the specifics of somersaulting because i'm no summer saltist but uh i'm pretty sure somersaulting is just like if you just roll like you do some kind of role or talk and it's like a it's like a combination of like words right oh is that like a roll oh you like roll on the ground yeah forward roll on the floor or any roll because you can do a forward somersault in the air you can do a forward somersault on ground like were you rolling
>
> [Music]

> i'm i think because i think it's just a generic term for like rolling in somewhere it's very solid yeah just do it just do it all right yeah yeah do a kickflip but you can actually do it yeah i did a kickflip yesterday i did two kick flips yesterday oh that's a great place man no that actually is a flex either okay clicks are hard they are really hard yeah they're it's really difficult like people that i know have been skating for a long time still can't do kick flips yeah they're they're they're hard yeah what the hell are we talking about we just stole that should we yeah this whole stream is just one big stall for update five that's that's all it is that's all i've ever been

> is satisfactory called factory game in the project code for unreal yes um i heard i've heard yes exactly it is uh correct i've heard that it is quite hard to change it and a lot of tools i use show the true name of application called color factor game yeah so we called it factory game and you're right it is hard to change which is why we haven't changed it i don't know if or when we ever will um the longer we we go into this the harder it gets changing the name um but like this is a this is a somewhat common problem for unreal engine games specifically i know that like arc is still called shooter game which is like the name of the template project in unreal engine when you like when you boot up unreal engine you can pick like if you want like a clean template like if you want a clean project with nothing in it or if you want like a template project with like some base functionality in it and uh one of them is called shooter game which is like a first person shooter like it's it's it's unreal tournaments like in a small like yeah segmented like thing yeah i think i think i don't talk was sangdom called furious i can't remember now that you mention it that because i know i know that it was called like i know that the the the code classes and stuff were sg yeah and i don't know if it was sanctum game or shooter game that's a good question and i get the feeling that when they started making the project they probably didn't know the game was called sanctum that's my assumption stargate you're right it is stargate game very good coffee stain got the license thing for that make a game for it yeah and i'm pretty sure like factory game is also based on that template uh with the first person shooter thing maybe i feel like most first-person games in a real engine usually based on that but i don't know yeah but we call it factory game because we didn't want to call it shooter game because it's confusing and it's not a shooter game yeah it's a factory game it is yeah uh sure glad yeah i'm sure glad we couldn't didn't call it factorio 3d game when we started that project well that would have been weird yeah whoops

> will there be any fixes for multiplayer's sync issues life forces trees being cut i'm not sure exactly what multiplayer fixes will be done but we always do work on them and with every major update there's always a whole host of like bug fixes uh from all areas of the game right so uh i don't know exactly if the the bugs that you're experiencing uh or that you're talking about here those specifically have been fixed but there's no doubt in my mind that a lot of bugs will have been fixed um so yeah hopefully hopefully it does take care of the ones that you're running into yeah it has to be a party pooper but i don't think we're going to be able to have time to fix that particular issue um because that's a huge system overall i guess okay but we we we sort of maybe we'll make like a some kind of like half solution or something i don't know but that's a huge uh problem this exists in there for a long time we kind of need to redo the whole like foliage system so that's not something we have time to do for this update he thinks it's but for the record um it's mostly just a visual issue sort of like on the server and everything still works the way it's supposed to so like if you run into that issue um like you can still pick up stuff sometimes if if it's correct unless something is really weird which also can be the case but like for the most part i think a lot of people are used to it by now too like where you just run around like hope to pick up foliage sometimes sometimes you get it sometimes you don't

> if i had to guess i think trains are going to behave sort of similar to how they did with land before um but they will collide with other trains i uh first i'm guessing um i think the thing we want to get in is collision without the trains and like signaling so that you have you know you need to manage your your training lines in a different way i don't think we care too much about like clipping with the environment like it's a similar thing with like conveyor belts like that if we need to fix the clipping issues with the trails uh the trains in in the terrain with the trains train lines then why aren't we fixing it for the conveyor belts you know so and the conveyor belts are like kind of an active choice that we don't want to like overdo or limit like what you can do with the game so like if clipping annoys you then you won't clip you know you won't build your factory's clipping and if you don't mind clipping um and also you get like a little bit more freedom then clipping is is enabled sort of or available to you um so i think that's sort of the approach that we're going to take with trains as well no i can't say for sure because we haven't reached that point where we've made a decision on that because we need to work on it first but so yeah that's that's i think that's my take on that as right now there will be train signals yes at some point there will be train signals

> uh when do we get a map updating for us so i can actually play the game without having uh without keep having in mind my instructors might disappear and stuff uh well so the reality is you're playing an early access game so you know that's that's probably that's likely gonna happen you know sometime soon when we do do the map update um but that's probably not gonna be the last time we do a map update right so this is kind of like you know uh something you're gonna have to just kind of deal with with the fact that we're in early access however um hopefully the plan is hopefully in the next few weeks uh i will be able to release some information about the world update um and with it i would like to try and just give some sort of like map with some like hotspots of regions that have been modified so that people can sort of uh plan ahead right but the thing is you know the game is designed so that you can build wherever you want so it's it's just likely that there are people out there that have just built in the hot spots of where we've made massive um modifications we've had it before where people have factories that end up being inside a mountain or underground and that's likely just going to happen again but hopefully with with um you know releasing that information when i do um with a map and some hotspots we can mitigate that kind of damage to give people some time to try and move their factories to a different location um but that's that's always going to be a pain like even moving like like what if your factory is in a hot spot right you're gonna have to move the whole thing it's gonna be a pain no matter what but it is it is kind of the nature of early access and we don't want to you know we're striving for a good 1.0 game and we don't want to be like well you know the world would look better if we made it like this but we you know it may scrub some factories so we're not going to do it you know we don't want to do that we do have to put the game first at the end of the day and that doesn't mean some people are going to get kind of screwed over by it to be honest when uh the world does change you know just some safe spots we can move yeah yeah yeah we'll do that sometime soon before like well before the update so that you'll have a lot of time to move things if you want to move things but no doubt they're gonna be no doubt the world is gonna change on top of your factories some of y'all uh a lot of work is gonna be taking place in the northern forest we have talked about that but yeah i i would like to i'll talk to hannah in the future and when we when we do release a video we'll try and release something that um will be as helpful as possible to uh ensure that people can safely move their factories

> uh what does the object limit uh refer to exactly one constructor because one object so this is the the confusing thing with the object limit it refers to you object which is not like a physical object or a game object an unreal engine it's an unreal an engine object which is like way programming languages try to like obfuscate how memory works is by referring to massive object you may have heard the term like object oriented languages where they try to like simplify it but how you how you can think of of code um and it's it's essentially a memory object and no one constructor does not equal one object one constructor is could be many objects i don't know the exact number um and they also vary from object to object like maybe you know maybe a beacon is like three objects or maybe two objects or one i don't know exactly and then another constructor could be many objects so uh it's really hard to like to to to to know but something that we sort of tell folks is that like the the number of people that actually hit this object limit is so so few yes like you shouldn't have to worry about it there's unless you're really building some super crazy stuff you really really should not worry about it um and so like you shouldn't have to like don't don't let the object limit impact the way that you play the game unless or do if you want to but you shouldn't need to like you should see a better play as you normally want to yeah and you know we do things on our end to reduce the uh the overhead or the impact that uh objects have on the objective as well yeah so and also the amount of people that hit that object limit that are playing the game vanilla is even smaller uh most people that hit it are using mods to like build way faster and stuff like that and build like humongous things like place i'm thinking i'm talking like placing down like you know half a million foundation blocks and stuff like that um

> uh any thoughts about attaching splitters directly to machines such miners i mean i like the idea i don't know why we don't have that uh but yeah i'm not sure so say that again what was it i missed the any thoughts of attaching splitters directly to machine slash miners yes i was actually part of a lot of discussion in that regard in the early days this is the early days because i believe we changed our minds a little bit but one of the main reasons was because it wasn't clear enough what happened uh when you just attached a splitter to a machine it became like odd to like figure out what was going on there's also like a technical reason um where we need the the the belt sort of and if we wanted to do the thing where you can attach splitters to to factories we would need to like add like additional logic to the splitters and mergers and it made it like pretty ugly um so we just decided not to pursue that it's not impossible that we change our minds in the future and and make it so that you can attach them straight on because i believe there's an exception to conveyor lifts because they are technically a belt you can attach splitters directly on them i believe correct me if i'm wrong um but that's not but that's because it is a conveyor belt and it already has because the problem with with the also with this threading in the game is that when we update the threads in the game they're updated separately so belts are upgraded updated separately and then splitters and then factory buildings which would mean that the order of execution would be like a special case when a factory building could output directly to a splitter so we would like mess up that update order or something i'm not quite sure exactly how what was the issue there but that was one of the reasons too but it's not like an impossible thing to fix at some point but i don't think we are going to spend time on that because it's a lot of it's a lot of time for like maybe a little too little payout sort of so yeah you

> uh can chainsaw use liquid in the future potentially we the reason why chainsaw only uses like solid biofuel up until now is because the that has that has made sense when you unlock or like rather when we intended to unlock the chainsaw and then further down the line it made sense like maybe to have other fuel and we haven't had that in the game because we haven't solved we haven't had support to like change fuels uh for the equipment and that's something that we're probably gonna do in the future i don't know exactly when that will happen um but that's why we haven't had in the game i'm pretty sure we're gonna have it at some point like turbo fuel and chainsaw or you know liquid biofuel which like what else do you use that for um so yeah

> any changes of the coloring system yes there's going to be some changes in the color system i don't know exactly what those changes are going to be that's something that is uh most likely going to change or one thing that i am i think is going to change maybe it will check my answer is like declining more and more um i think there's some issues with the coloring system that we've been putting off um such as not being to like paint vehicles and stuff like that so i think there's gonna be somewhat of an overhaul of the coloring system and the fact that we're like using srgb uh or not wait are we using linear rgb in the game or not i can't remember whatever the the color values in game aren't linear i think or they are linear wait which one is the common one hsl yeah yeah but that's not the thing i'm talking about right now because you can even if you if you if you're like in a uh if you're like on the internet you're like look up a color and you see like oh that's a nice color and you try to match it uh in the game it will still not be correct and that's because the in-game color picker is is using srgb which isn't a linear color space but most applications use color like linear color space even if you have the same hex it will not like match uh that's just because we picked one of them so we're probably gonna change that as well because i think a lot of people are confused by that uh i think a lot of people don't even realize it um and yeah we do we do use hl hsl in the color picker but that's not what i'm talking about right now um but that's something we probably will also change at some point this is like ui that probably is is like in the backlog of things uh we just haven't been prioritized well enough so we'll probably happen in alignment with the coloring system

> so wind power mark when no

> [Laughter]

> um what is the what is the reasoning why we don't want to add wind wind power or solar power or stuff like that uh i think both of those have the problem where that you can effectively even if you make a system around it that kind of checks for uh certain restrictions that you can just build them everywhere of course they would still effectively be limitless in in this game i think uh and we don't really want that for power like you could just build a giant solar panel field and not have to worry about the power at all which kind of defeats the point of the power system where it's supposed to be a pain in your butt every now and then and you're supposed to want to fix it and make it all run smoothly and i feel that that those kind of power supplies would take away from it because they don't have enough limitations that we can effectively uh contain the balancing off gotcha remember we we also brought up like water turbines yeah i think those will be more in the realm of what the the geysers now do yeah and right now the guys have the issue where some people actually brought this up where they feel kind of what kind of they're super weak for when you get them the amount of power that you get from them uh so we might change it as well but for the yeah water turbines i would be more interested in them because you would have to place them potentially on fast flowing rivers or waterfalls which are a limited resource so to say in the world which is more interesting in my opinion because it kind of gets you around like you can't just pop them down anywhere you actually have to find a waterfall we get up a cliff to get to the waterfall place them there connecting to your factory i think it's a more interesting way to approach power with a bit of a challenge like that than just to give a building that just produces it out of thin air gotcha free power when do we get free power

> what's the feature you wanna add to this so i personally really wanna improve the build modes uh i there are there are a lot i think we talked about this last week as well there are a few um there are a few things that really annoy me when you're building and i think there are somewhat easy to fix and they will improve building immensely so i would love to to improve some of those things first and foremost and maybe like a global grid situation but also like how you place you know um mergers and splitters i think that's one of the like places mergers and splitters uh not the fact that they don't clip on foundations when you're dragging them i'm already placed um conveyor belts and stuff like that i think that's really annoying uh stuff like you know the what are they called the the pipe connector thingies i can't remember what they're called that they rotate too i think they rotate too freely i want them to be able to clip snap it a bit better the snapping system we have for the guidelines thing when the green lines show up when you hold control that's a prototype that's not done at all um that's a prototype i made and then we're like alright i just put in the game whatever it works pipe junction thank you uh i want i want better clipping and like snapping with that so if you're if you're one of those people that like builds very methodically it just makes it so much easier to build because i think the addition of the the hover pack makes things so much better in the game i think the hover pack is like one of the best items in the game right now um so improving the the build modes would make the game a ton better imo god i love the hover pack i know it's so good right

> object limit any chance to display how much is left somehow uh not really the the common misconception about the object limit is that people think that it's like the number of objects that are placed in the world but this is a memory thing so you know placing a foundation has a smaller object you object imprint in memory than placing a constructor has um and it's not simple to explain it because memory in programming is is very complex uh it's not just like a lot of people often like describe it as like it's a it's an array of of of um ones and zeros that's memory no that's not exactly how it works uh because they're there's like memory caches and and setups for how they're loaded and stuff like that but uh the system that handles all that has a limit in unreal engine and uh there's not much we can do about it uh we can optimize for it but there's always going to be a limit um and you can even load a save file that crashes due to the object limit you can you can sometimes load that save file and sometimes you can based on what's going on in the game at that point um so kind of hard to it's it's hard to explain we're optimizing for it um and maybe in the future it will be a bit better but there's all there'll always be like a limit to it

> march 16. we still have questions now you know why does it go to experimental first and basically it's because we want the early access branch to be stable basically that's our stable branch and we do everything we can to make sure that the you know with testing internally to make sure that the game is as stable as possible when we bring it to experimental but we can never really be sure you know there's only like 30 40 of us or something like that and there's a bajillion of you guys and the feedback and the crash reports and all that kind of stuff that we get from you guys in the community um is just on a level that we couldn't get ourselves when testing internally so we put it we always put this stuff out all of our updates out on experimental first we gather as much information and feedback from you guys as possible fix any bugs all that kind of stuff stabilize the game and then once it's stable we bring it over to early access and that's just kind of the procedure that we have you might be wondering then so like okay so when's it gonna be on

> um so are you pack packing the update 4 to an engine upgrade um so yeah um the engine upgrade won't go to early access before update 4 comes to early access so we will keep the engine upgrade on experimental branch as update 4 drops and then we're going to keep working on that until we feel that they both work and the main reason for that is because we there were a few like things that got way better for some people with the engine upgrade but some larger factory lines and stuff like that didn't get better um they got worse um so and that's annoying we don't want to like push the upgrade that can result in some people playing in early access getting a worse experience we would rather fix those issues before we do that and we don't have time to do that before update 4 launches so that's why we're doing it this way
