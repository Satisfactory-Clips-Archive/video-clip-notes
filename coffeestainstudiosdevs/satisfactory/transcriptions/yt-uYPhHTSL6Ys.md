> 
> hopefully impact your
> 
> experience playing the game in terms of
> 
> like performance or whatever
> 
> uh and i might mention a couple things
> 
> that you know we benefit from as
> 
> developers because maybe as a
> 
> gamer maybe you don't know what uh in
> 
> what ways an engine upgrade can impact
> 
> the developer as well so it just might
> 
> be interesting right so
> 
> um yeah probably
> 
> um engine upgrade on tuesday next week
> 
> and then a video on thursday or friday
> 
> with information about that
> 
> and i'm trying to get some like i'm
> 
> gonna see if we can get like some like
> 
> actual raw data
> 
> as well to see where we may have gained
> 
> uh some performance or
> 
> whatever so we'll see what those numbers
> 
> look like and uh we'll take a look
> 
> yeah uh impact meaning crash your game
> 
> absolutely
> 
> uh that is a possibility so upgrading
> 
> and i'll go into detail on that in the
> 
> video i really hope i remember to do
> 
> that
> 
> um but yeah usually upgrading the engine
> 
> can uh cause some instability issues
> 
> especially since we've edited the engine
> 
> ourselves
> 
> to get the game to where it is so
> 
> sometimes it can get a bit tricky when
> 
> we upgrade the engine
> 
> and this is a big upgrade this time
> 
> we're going like three versions or
> 
> something so it's
> 
> probably there's probably going to be
> 
> some issues but hopefully there's also
> 
> going to be some
> 
> some big improvements because everyone
> 
> wants mirrors
> 
> this guy in his mirrors i swear to god
> 
> uh and i guess
> 
> i guess you know what someone asked
> 
> about the uh the mug before i guess
> 
> that's kind of a state of dev thing we
> 
> can give you an update on that
> 
> um uh the the current situation with
> 
> mugs is
> 
> um we pretty sure we know who we're
> 
> going with and all that kind of stuff
> 
> and we
> 
> um to the point now where we're sort of
> 
> in the final sort of ish phases of like
> 
> just prototyping it or whatever uh
> 
> basically and so we think that
> 
> you know it we might try get it out
> 
> around with update 4 around that time
> 
> uh the mug but uh it's it's no longer
> 
> this big thing about like uh you know
> 
> previously the state of the mug was yeah
> 
> we kind of think we know where we're
> 
> going we have some ideas we're not sure
> 
> when but now there's
> 
> a pretty good estimate as to when uh we
> 
> could expect the mug
> 
> uh and it should be around update four
> 
> maybe a little bit after
> 
> unless things change uh let the mug have
> 
> eu
> 
> prices it won't because we still only
> 
> have the same shop but
> 
> eu store is still something that we are
> 
> actively looking into and working on
> 
> right now so
> 
> who knows it we we may be able to have
> 
> that at that time i kind of don't think
> 
> so though
> 
> if we do get an eu store what's likely
> 
> going to happen
> 
> is it's going to be an eu store with all
> 
> the basic stuff
> 
> you know like your hoodies and stuff but
> 
> maybe some special things and premium
> 
> things
> 
> like the mugs might end up not being on
> 
> the store at first
> 
> that's kind of kind of how it looks like
> 
> things will be
> 
> but uh we're gonna keep looking into it
> 
> uh and we'll let you know
> 
> uh once we know more dope
> 
> yeah so there's that uh anything else i
> 
> think that's pretty much it
> 
> yeah pretty much that is it um
> 
> yeah i guess yeah next next week will be
> 
> the first of december
> 
> yeah december being the month of
> 
> christmas or the holiday season
> 
> or whatever people call them call it
> 
> call that period in your part of the
> 
> world
> 
> uh and so we can give some there'll be
> 
> some stuff happening then and we can
> 
> talk more about it next week as well so
> 
> yes it's gonna be cool
