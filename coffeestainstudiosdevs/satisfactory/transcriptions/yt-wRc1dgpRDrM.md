### Transcript

> why didn't the work say why don't the saves work on experimental work on normal so here's the way the saves work you can only load a save file that's been saved on a previous version or the same version there's a number in the top left corner of the game when you play it and uh save files have no way of knowing you know if you load future content that we made it's impossible for save files to know that oh that's a that's a feature that's coming and i'll load it that's impossible because it's not in the save file or it's not in the game so how could it possibly load it at that point so that's why you can only load save files that are made in a previous version of the game
