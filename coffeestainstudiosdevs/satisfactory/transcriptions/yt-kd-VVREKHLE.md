> why did the anti-spider mode went off yo actually okay so this might be good to address as well because i don't think i've communicated this clearly enough um if you play an experimental and you play on ea uh on epic specifically or steam i think this happens to me as well it's using two different configuration setups um so if you're playing on experimental and you go in the settings menu and you like pick your settings and then when you switch back to ea those settings are not there because you set them on experimental so you need to reset them um and in some cases there might be some settings that don't take effect what you need to do in those cases is you need to delete your your config folder which is located under uh look lap data factory game saved config i think uh if you just delete that folder it will recreate it with the default values in the game when you restart it um
