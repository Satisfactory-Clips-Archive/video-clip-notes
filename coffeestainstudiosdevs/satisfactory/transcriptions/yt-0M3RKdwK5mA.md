> um i don't know when when official mods
> 
> support one drop
> 
> um i mean we do have ish like right now
> 
> there is an official inofficial mod
> 
> support in the game
> 
> for the game our modding community is
> 
> amazing
> 
> um but we don't have like the official
> 
> mod support yet
> 
> and i guess i can touch on that as well
> 
> because people are gonna ask this later
> 
> than one as well whether we're gonna
> 
> have like
> 
> steam workshop support or epics whatever
> 
> they're calling it
> 
> they have a name for it but right
> 
> oh whatever um epic have their own
> 
> version of workshop as well and they're
> 
> about to release it
> 
> um it's like
> 
> really really really soon gonna be
> 
> available i think they're waiting
> 
> honestly my
> 
> this is i'm uh what's the word
> 
> this is my guess i think they're waiting
> 
> for more games to have proper mod
> 
> support until they actually launch it
> 
> because i think it's done
> 
> because they've been talking about a lot
> 
> but yeah we don't know whether or not
> 
> the game will have
> 
> like official uh steam workshop support
> 
> uh because it kind of comes down to like
> 
> the ecosystem of mods we
> 
> really want to like sustain the mods
> 
> that are made already
> 
> and the modern community that we have we
> 
> uh
> 
> we like really love
> 
> our money community that we have right
> 
> now so
> 
> we also want to be able to support both
> 
> uh versions of the game
> 
> both on epic and on steam so you don't
> 
> feel like left out so we don't want to
> 
> run into a situation where like you know
> 
> you know there are better mods in the
> 
> steam version than on the epic version
> 
> because we'll be you know unfair to the
> 
> people that uh first of all bought on
> 
> epic and the people that want to buy on
> 
> epic
> 
> and even if we and even if like epic
> 
> have their own version and we have steam
> 
> workshop
> 
> like if it's a hassle for mod makers to
> 
> have to like upload to two different
> 
> places then it's also not
> 
> you know the best solution for everyone
> 
> um
> 
> and in that case we'll probably make
> 
> like our own in-game mod manager maybe
> 
> or something like that or we'll maybe
> 
> extend the one that they've already
> 
> created
> 
> i don't know these are speculations on
> 
> my part uh but we do
> 
> really care about uh mod support and it
> 
> will happen eventually
> 
> officially for the game at some point
> 
> hashtag
> 
> so yeah that's that's the uh
> 
> tldr of that situation well said
> 
> thanks
