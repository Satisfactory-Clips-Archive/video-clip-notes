> oh so so then which brings us to uh game
>
> modes
>
> um so some people ask about peaceful or
>
> creative mode or whatever
>
> and maybe that's even relevant to the to
>
> what i just said before about
>
> needing to know what the game is more
>
> supposed to be like first
>
> or is that not relevant in in some ways
>
> yeah
>
> i mean we we have been looking at i mean
>
> game modes is kind of a broad thing
>
> you could make it into really broad
>
> thing right because you could have this
>
> whole window where you could adjust all
>
> these settings
>
> of how you want your game specifically
>
> to play
>
> and that is something that might be a
>
> bit extensive but it might totally be
>
> worth it but things like
>
> peaceful mode and creative mode i don't
>
> think they're too hard for us to do
>
> and they seem very much worth it because
>
> i think a lot of players would just love
>
> to build without having to worry about
>
> costs in any way
>
> and a lot of players do not like the
>
> combat because it's just
>
> like they don't have the reaction time
>
> or that's not the reason that they want
>
> to play this
>
> and i think we should support those
>
> those options because of that
>
> yeah and i mean internally we do have
>
> cheats that would
>
> allow this it's just that they're very
>
> crude i think so that's why we haven't
>
> done it yet but
>
> yeah because we will yeah it is
>
> like uh one other thing that we've said
>
> before as as for why we don't want to do
>
> it just yet is that
>
> we need to focus feedback on what we
>
> want to
>
> do like on sorry on
>
> on uh building the base game for the
>
> most part um
>
> if we start getting feedback from folks
>
> in creative mode who want certain things
>
> which is not
>
> uh relevant to the base game then it's
>
> it's going to muddy the waters a little
>
> bit is that
>
> um do you think that that is a a legit
>
> reason or is that
>
> not really part of the decision making
>
> on that
>
> topic so far i lost you there
>
> yeah me too man too long did not listen
>
> so okay yeah so so is is uh
>
> uh my brain so is
>
> is muddying the waters one reason we
>
> don't want to go into
>
> uh other uh game modes just yet
>
> so if we have people in um yeah so okay
>
> that made sense
>
> could have said it in 10 words
>
> [Laughter]
>
> no i was just not listening that's that
>
> was the problem it wasn't that it was
>
> too long
>
> yeah i just lost my focus for a bit uh
>
> no um
>
> that has been uh an argument that has
>
> been brought up
>
> by someone i don't know who but yeah i
>
> mean it would be a problem right because
>
> if all these peoples are playing in
>
> different ways then we don't really know
>
> necessarily what they're referring to
>
> when they give us feedback on certain
>
> things
>
> yeah and even if they say oh no i'm
>
> playing in this this mode then we still
>
> get a lot of these different
>
> directions that we're getting feedback
>
> from that might just kind of make it
>
> harder for us to address
>
> issues yeah uh it might not be the
>
> biggest problem
>
> and we'll have to assess it but yeah it
>
> could be an issue
>
> i guess i guess to some degree uh the
>
> like there are people who are making
>
> mods for the game you know unofficially
>
> i guess to some degree that's also part
>
> of it however
>
> or that would contribute the same sort
>
> of confusion maybe
>
> uh or money of the waters of our
>
> feedback that we get
>
> however i also think that folks who go
>
> through that effort to get mods
>
> kind of just know that when their
>
> frustrations
>
> around despite using the mods they don't
>
> really give that feedback
>
> maybe or i'm not sure yeah
>
> i think generally the mods just make
>
> their lives better but they might have
>
> more issues
>
> like technical problems coming up right
>
> yeah for sure for sure
