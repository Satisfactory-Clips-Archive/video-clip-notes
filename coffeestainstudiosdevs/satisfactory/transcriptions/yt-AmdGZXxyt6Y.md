> yeah i think i think all the ui game
> 
> mechanics aren't like
> 
> this anymore i remember around this time
> 
> was when we got our current um
> 
> ui ux person natalie in we have another
> 
> person as well uh who works with her
> 
> pontus but at that time it was natalie
> 
> and
> 
> she'd come in and we'd never really had
> 
> a dedicated ui or ux person
> 
> um and uh and she was
> 
> the only one in the company who was
> 
> doing it was kind of alone in this one
> 
> task
> 
> but she did a fantastic job as we can
> 
> see today um
> 
> you know user interface and user
> 
> experience is like amazing
> 
> yeah now yeah i just want to point out
> 
> that uh
> 
> the the the scanner right now is iron
> 
> ore copper ore and
> 
> the rock
> 
> it's actually the wrong uh every game
> 
> needs a natalie you know what she would
> 
> love to hear that
> 
> if uh you know if you guys are on
> 
> twitter you should go to him be like
> 
> thanks natalie
> 
> did you see what you had in crowd from
> 
> this is my memory right i can't speak
> 
> for her but
> 
> from memory like this was like the first
> 
> i think this is the first game industry
> 
> job
> 
> i think but she had been relatively
> 
> inexperienced at that time
> 
> yeah so like there was this mix of um
> 
> when it's like well i'm the only one
> 
> taking care of this one
> 
> massive task but there's also no one
> 
> else here who's trying to do it
> 
> so it's just kind of hard so like i
> 
> don't think she looked at what we had
> 
> was like and cried i think
> 
> the vibe i would have got was that she
> 
> would have seen okay there's a lot of
> 
> work to do
> 
> but she's also overwhelmed in the
> 
> position that she's in um
> 
> that's that's the vibe that i that that
> 
> i think i get yeah
> 
> and in some in some situations here i
> 
> can see that like some of the
> 
> like the the menus work the same way
> 
> and in some ways i think natalie has
> 
> been like can we please change the ux
> 
> to not have to like do this thing
> 
> uh because it's i guess it's like both
> 
> things for her like
> 
> she also had to redesign based on what
> 
> existed because like this
> 
> radial menu is still in the game for
> 
> instance and she redesigned that
> 
> but i think there's also other menus
> 
> where she was just like
> 
> ah i think there's a better way to
> 
> present this information
> 
> than just have it like this and then
> 
> it's also hard for an entire team that
> 
> has you know like pretty much never
> 
> really been trained in that kind of
> 
> stuff
> 
> never has focused on it before uh you
> 
> know but then you're
> 
> but then you're the only person calling
> 
> that shot must be kind of scary and
> 
> intimidating i would imagine
> 
> like hey everyone i'm creating work for
> 
> you all now because uh
> 
> that i could do all right so i think
> 
> it's gonna unlock in like okay 15
> 
> seconds so let's see what happens if i
> 
> just roll around
> 
> did she design the sync store ui i'm not
> 
> sure if she did or not like
> 
> it's her and pontius now are the team
> 
> yeah ux is user experience that's
> 
> correct
> 
> um so like i don't know if it was her or
> 
> both of them it was probably
> 
> a team effort
>
