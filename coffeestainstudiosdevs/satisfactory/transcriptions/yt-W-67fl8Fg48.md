### Transcript

> will the blade runners actually be attached to the body at some point they are attached to the body when you're when you're first person so you don't really see it like if you look down on your legs right jace they look correct right yeah it looks right there it's just the third person character that's like a bit messed up soon well we're we're currently working a little bit of our equipment um how it works and we're gonna do more of that in the future not for update four but like in the coming updates there's gonna be some changes to how equipment works like in i'm saying programming wise like not you know necessarily in the game but um we we're working a little bit on those systems currently so hopefully that bug will be fixed in along with those changes
