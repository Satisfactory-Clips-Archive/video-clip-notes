> um what was i gonna say
> 
> yeah so on friday hopefully uh maybe uh
> 
> one of our developers dylan is gonna be
> 
> streaming a little bit of
> 
> development and talk a lot about what
> 
> he's doing he's been working on this
> 
> new save system format ooh which had
> 
> like no effect on anyone playing the
> 
> game
> 
> but it might be interesting it might be
> 
> interesting and it has a big
> 
> it has had a big impact on us for us
> 
> going forward working on the level
> 
> um so it's a it's a pretty big
> 
> significant improvement for us
> 
> at least so the only way for us really
> 
> to highlight that is to have dylan talk
> 
> a little bit better
> 
> would that uh would that affect like the
> 
> auto saves at all um
> 
> so i don't think it will i when i
> 
> air quotes i don't think it will but
> 
> dylan did look at like
> 
> that part of it and like
> 
> maybe i can improve it a little bit so
> 
> he's i don't know
> 
> i don't want to promise anything because
> 
> i don't know if this was like if i
> 
> misunderstood him but it
> 
> sounded like it might be a little bit
> 
> better like no
> 
> huge improvement but he did notice that
> 
> he had like this
> 
> test say that it was running um and
> 
> he said that like it would save in like
> 
> whatever time it was and he got a little
> 
> bit of improvement and he
> 
> and that was a fairly big save um so he
> 
> said that yeah
> 
> maybe a little bit better but i don't
> 
> want to make any promises because i've
> 
> only tested like a few
> 
> save files uh and you know it's very
> 
> like
> 
> when it comes to optimization and like
> 
> you know generally how the game run
> 
> and all the like complications that
> 
> people run into like
> 
> the way people can build makes it so
> 
> that
> 
> there are so many like constellations
> 
> and combinations of things that we
> 
> haven't like
> 
> yet noticed or like thought about
> 
> so um like when we've been testing we've
> 
> found like oh in this use case there's
> 
> an issue and that's a fairly easy simple
> 
> fix and there's just a bunch of those
> 
> types of use cases so when we've been
> 
> testing saving and we noticed like oh
> 
> it's a little bit better
> 
> like that doesn't necessarily mean that
> 
> it's better overall
> 
> because we've had in the past where like
> 
> we've done tests and it looked like
> 
> ah there's no significant improvement
> 
> and then when people in community play
> 
> it and we're like wait there's a
> 
> significant improvement in community uh
> 
> at least how people are reporting it
> 
> so it's kind of hard for us to know
> 
> sometimes so it might be that
> 
> but fingers crossed maybe
> 
> but anyway at any rate he'll be able to
> 
> talk a bit more about exactly what
> 
> it means and he's a cool guy so you get
> 
> to like meet him and hang out with him
> 
> yeah he's all right
> 
> um so that's coming
> 
> friday hopefully we'll we'll post on our
> 
> socials and whatnot when
> 
> when when things will happen hopefully
> 
> we can do more of this in the future uh
> 
> have more
> 
> we we did in the past we had a few dev
> 
> streams where people would uh
> 
> stream while working yeah we're trying
> 
> to get like more devs
> 
> uh involved now yeah um and like
> 
> trying to get them like scheduled in as
> 
> well and that doesn't take too much away
> 
> from the game because like for example
> 
> anna we made a video i don't know if you
> 
> guys have seen it check out youtube
> 
> um i made it i made a video with anna
> 
> our 3d artist and she
> 
> showed off some stuff um and you know
> 
> that's a
> 
> just a few hours of her time and
> 
> we're not going to have her on for i
> 
> don't know like a month or two or three
> 
> because there are other people to
> 
> highlight right so it's only like three
> 
> four hours of one person's time uh taken
> 
> away
> 
> so like those things you get to meet
> 
> people you get to see
> 
> uh their work flow you get to see some
> 
> of the just the in-game behind the
> 
> scenes stuff
> 
> and it doesn't really take away you get
> 
> to meet them and then it doesn't really
> 
> take away from the
> 
> uh dev um time at all
> 
> yeah i posted a link uh of that video in
> 
> chat
> 
> if you're into like because this is like
> 
> the first time we've ever
> 
> showcased any 3d artist i believe yeah
> 
> yeah
> 
> so i think it's a pretty big deal um so
> 
> if you're
> 
> interested in like the 3d uh
> 
> like artist aspect of of
> 
> creating our game i highly recommend it
> 
> because she goes
> 
> really deep into like maya and how she
> 
> sculpts and
> 
> uh models the assets which is a real
> 
> like significant
> 
> like i don't think people understand how
> 
> how much time it takes to create
> 
> those assets uh yeah and you'll learn a
> 
> bit more she showcases a little bit of
> 
> shaders uh some textures the different
> 
> tools that she uses it's
> 
> it's really nice and she's cool i say
> 
> that about everyone that's on but like
> 
> it's because i only picked the cool
> 
> people the rest of my garbage i'm
> 
> kidding it's a joke
> 
> it's a joke camera ah
> 
> cut to commercial [ __ ] uh hashtag cancel
> 
> js
> 
> yeah technical difficulties uh
> 
> so yeah if yeah highly recommend
> 
> checking that out if you're into
> 
> 3d art and want to know more but we're
> 
> we're also using blender now so it's
> 
> it's like tiny bit
> 
> outdated i guess or
> 
> uh well all our 3d areas blender now i
> 
> mean
> 
> i mean it's kind of outdated because she
> 
> used older files right yeah like she did
> 
> the manufacturer before we switched
> 
> i mean the work process is still the
> 
> same and like
> 
> it's still showcasing three i like how
> 
> yeah
>
