### Transcript

> when do you where do you draw the line between seeing the game is finished and adding stuff post released uh when it's 1.0 uh sorry that's a stupid answer to that question um when we feel like the game is done is is sort of a really tricky question to answer because we don't know uh for sure i think we have it's a little bit like based on time and a little bit based on like what we feel are core elements to the game that we really want um so so so when it comes to like time for instance we don't want the game to be in early access forever we kind of want to move on like move ahead at some point we don't want to work on satisfactory four forever uh so at some point we're gonna like stop working on the game you know um but when that happens i'm not quite sure we've settled on exactly um so uh and like at that point maybe we'll we'll like you know in whatever 2050 or whatever when we we feel like this is when we should have finished the game we'll like sit down and be like all right what's in the game do we feel like this is valid enough for 1.0 and i think at that point we're just gonna stop working on it and say like this is 1.0 and then maybe we'll do post-work stuff on more more things that we feel like oh we should about it this is cool but i think we i think we have a somewhat of a vision of like what we feel a complete satisfactory looks like um and then we can add most like dlc or whatever on top of that if we feel like we want to add more
