> Natalie a really good friend of mine who
> I met in college was interning here and
> she was talking about how cool it was
> and how the people were awesome and that
> the work was cool and I figured out that
> I wasn't really too much for a triple-a
> development and I was looking for a
> different kind of workplace essentially
> so I was like okay and Natalie told me
> that they were looking for another
> designer so I applied as for an
> internship here and I got in and that's
> pretty much how how it all started so I
> I uh my my spot here - Natalie most
> likely because honestly coffee-stained
> wasn't really on my radar before I
> played goat simulator and I sort of
> vaguely knew about them but I didn't
> really know pay attention I guess but my
> eyes were opened
