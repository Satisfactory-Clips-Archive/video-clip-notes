### Transcript

> all right um
>
> let's talk a little bit about something
>
> that we talked about you and me chat we
>
> talked about this last week
>
> about lights and uh how
>
> they affect the day and night cycle um
>
> we for those who don't know uh up into
>
> this point well
>
> still the game has the daily night cycle
>
> of
>
> being 45 minutes our day time and five
>
> minutes our night time and
>
> that made sound like the five minutes
>
> night time is the thing that a lot of
>
> people are like wait what
>
> it's only five minutes it feels like
>
> forever
>
> um and since we added nights people are
>
> like yo
>
> we need longer nights because i can't
>
> like i don't get to enjoy my lights as
>
> much as i want to
>
> um just wanted to bring you into that
>
> discussion mark what do you think about
>
> that
>
> i think it's such a fun thing that
>
> people started realizing that something
>
> like
>
> that was annoying them before like that
>
> is so short all of a sudden
>
> yeah like if we were to bring up this
>
> before like before we had lights about
>
> like yeah we're thinking of extending
>
> the night times we would be
>
> crucified
>
> oh so funny oh it's yeah
>
> it's one of those fun realizations where
>
> if something is frustrating you because
>
> it's
>
> it's annoying to play during night if
>
> you don't have the lights yeah
>
> yeah it feels like it takes longer right
>
> and suddenly you have the lights and you
>
> want them
>
> to illuminate your factory for longer
>
> and then suddenly the light
>
> the night flies by yeah uh
>
> i think we can solve this i mean we have
>
> talked about it internally like a bunch
>
> of people have talked to me about the
>
> fact that that is actually a request now
>
> i don't see any reason to not change it
>
> but just kind of the balancing might be
>
> a problem
>
> so i if you don't want to yeah i ran a
>
> poll on twitter
>
> about it and a lot of people suggested
>
> doing like a thing where
>
> we could have maybe a slider or
>
> something in the game where like you
>
> pick
>
> how how long maybe not like
>
> i'm not sure exactly how that would work
>
> but in my head it would be like maybe a
>
> ratio thing so like you can pick like i
>
> want half the day and half the night or
>
> something like that
>
> but does that yeah how would that affect
>
> the the game
>
> currently i think it wouldn't really
>
> because there is one thing there's
>
> because there's one game
>
> play aspect that is maybe not super tied
>
> to
>
> to the night time and daytime but
>
> there's one little thing and that's the
>
> spawning of like the little critters
>
> that show up during night
>
> this the kitty cats yeah the kitty cats
>
> exactly um
>
> yeah because they have spawners that are
>
> specifically only triggered at night
>
> yeah or specifically you told me before
>
> they're they're tied to like the
>
> day time so it's not they're not tied to
>
> like the the
>
> what's it called the time of day the
>
> other tied to the clock so it's like a
>
> specific
>
> time on the internal game clock i guess
>
> yeah exactly for every day
>
> in satisfactory yeah so the benefit
>
> there is that if we would
>
> allow them to extend the night time it
>
> wouldn't change how
>
> this thing or spawn and i don't think it
>
> necessarily
>
> has to i don't they i think they already
>
> spawned before the actual nighttime like
>
> this pawn had
>
> um dusk and they'd be spawning dawn
>
> i don't know because we in the past
>
> already reduced an and i think that
>
> them used to be 15 minutes mark mark are
>
> you turning into a robot
>
> why it's a discord we might need to
>
> restart the discord call
>
> am i being a little robotic voice now
>
> yeah oh no it's good again is it better
>
> yeah yeah you used better you just
>
> needed a posture check
>
> then discord works fine again all right
>
> yeah it might be that because this
>
> headphone these headphones are wireless
>
> sometimes they yeah maybe they do weird
>
> possible yeah so uh so yeah so it
>
> wouldn't affect the spawn right maybe
>
> the only thing is that like it's not as
>
> clear
>
> when they spawn maybe because you know
>
> like when it turns tonight you're like
>
> oh here we go
>
> here they come yeah that is a good point
>
> actually so you're less aware of
>
> i'm not sure how many players are
>
> currently aware though
>
> it's more of an aesthetic thing that you
>
> you can only encounter them outside of
>
> caves when it is
>
> night yeah and that would stay the same
>
> because i don't think we're gonna allow
>
> people to
>
> i mean we could allow them to completely
>
> get rid of the night but
>
> yeah yeah i mean it's something that we
>
> have to figure out but i think it
>
> shouldn't
>
> be too crazy for us because i don't
>
> think the the daytime
>
> is affected by the nighttime i think you
>
> can independently make the nighttime
>
> longer without making the daytime longer
>
> possibly you can say that correctly yeah
>
> i will i will have to look into how we
>
> set that up again
>
> but it might be not the hardest thing in
>
> the world and if that is the case then
>
> of course that kind of bumps it up and
>
> when we can actually try to do it
>
> so we'll see is the long short short
>
> answer to this
>
> is we'll see what happens we'll see what
>
> happens
