### Transcript

> yeah alrighty which can be saved up in
>
> power storages
>
> geothermal is getting a change too
>
> instead of supplying a static amount of
>
> power i just want to say something real
>
> quickly about the power storage
>
> it was it was always interesting to me
>
> that when we like when we released it i
>
> always felt like power storage
>
> kind of lacked this weird thing where it
>
> was like it lacked a little bit of
>
> justification there was some things for
>
> the following man
>
> there was some justification for the
>
> power storage but it never really
>
> like in my mind like the designer in me
>
> was like it's never it has never really
>
> been fully justified
>
> unless you know of the particle
>
> accelerator
>
> yeah and then then yeah exactly
>
> even not i think even geothermal is not
>
> enough
>
> personally because i'm like you could
>
> have just left geothermal the same right
>
> but like so so that helps that
>
> definitely the change to geothermal
>
> makes it more interesting power storage
>
> synergizes with that that's good
>
> um but yeah but i i think it never made
>
> complete sense
>
> until we revealed the uh particle
>
> accelerator no
>
> that it's like oh you need these you
>
> really need these they're important the
>
> fact that there's
>
> uh dynamics in the power like
>
> consumption
>
> and uh yeah per recipe as well you know
>
> exactly
>
> exactly yep okay
