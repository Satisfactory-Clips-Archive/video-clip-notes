> i want this to be effective for
>
> yeah it was a float floor okay so that
>
> was right
>
> yeah okay this is interesting
>
> because now i don't know why it's not
>
> picking up that
>
> it's blind for him
>
> supply and prime what did i miss man i
>
> haven't done shaders in a long time
>
> oh yeah this is it's like going back to
>
> the
>
> the trenches i kind of miss doing opengl
>
> to be honest
>

>
> yeah yeah it's honestly so much better
