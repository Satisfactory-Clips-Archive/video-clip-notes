### Transcript

> Will all the tech be available in the Alpha?
> Not all the tech will be available,
> it'll be the early and mid-game tech only,
> we're hiding away the late game stuff
> so that you can see it a little later.
> And also we want to see, you know,
> how the gameplay works,
> from transition from early to mid-game.
> The stages of the Alpha will also
> focus on starting points,
> that doesn't mean the map is not cut off
> but we really want to start you in one area,
> and see how do they play there,
> and how does the game develop
> in that starting area,
> and then move you to a different one,
> and then move you to a different one.
> But if you want to go for a walk to
> the other side of the map and start there,
