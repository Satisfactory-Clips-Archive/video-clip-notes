> is console confirmed to satisfactory uh it's not confirmed so there's no rough time we we just don't know it's not like a yes or no thing we just don't think about it we're too busy um getting the windows version of the game working for those of you who want the game on console want to know why uh having maintaining the game on different platforms uh comes with a massive overhead uh so that we would be putting in so much time and resources into uh making the game run on all the platforms uh making sure that the certification and all that kind of stuff is done for console as well um all of this time that could go into actually making the game and making the decisions we need to do for the game and adding features or whatever and we would rather finish the game and then maybe get it over uh on console rather than focus on console anytime like now and then just make very very slow progress on the actual game itself um
