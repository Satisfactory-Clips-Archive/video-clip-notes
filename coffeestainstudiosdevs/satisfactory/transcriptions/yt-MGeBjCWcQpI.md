> it's really good and and another thing i want to say is like just in general we were really good at um just delivering our lines on that day you know like time was of the essence we did all the filming in one day it was like 10 hours straight again a lot of new people have joined so i'm saying this again but it was like 10 hours straight carrying equipment around walking around running around filming all that kind of stuff um so it was really exhausting and but we really got our takes uh done like really quickly and you know i i'm actually very bad like i know i do a lot of the youtube stuff for for satisfactory i'm actually quite bad at lines but um like i just look i'm just gonna toot my own horn here i think i did a great job on this day i think i got uh a lot of complex lines i think i got them pretty quickly like i didn't have to i didn't up that much and i feel like i i feel like a lot of the practice and acting school that i went to you know i'm not great but it paid off it really did pay off like it like to me it shows to me i really see the difference um and so so to me i'm very happy personally uh with that so yeah yeah i feel like the the uh exactly the act the acting wasn't like something that blocked us during filming at all it really wasn't like like i would i would say like 70 of the time was spent moving and setting up equipment yeah because we're filming because like all the scenes have set up with like at least two lights and there's the camera gear like the tripod and whatever and our mics and whatever it's just it's there's a there's a lot like every scene has been shot with with like practical not practic what's the term like stage lights essentially yeah um and they're huge and heavy and yeah yeah yeah all right cool
