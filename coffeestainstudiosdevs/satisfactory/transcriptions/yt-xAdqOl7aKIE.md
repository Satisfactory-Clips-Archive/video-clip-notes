### Transcript

> okay so this is interesting yeah i don't want any of this let's take a look here return variant transform local world so the things that have changed since we changed the spline params i have to make sure that they're all lining up okay and before

> before i'm in the 423 version i won't do the compare now but we actually had a custom implementation for these two and i'm worried that we're going to have to revert to that um but it was basically we called one function which would call their code if it was their splines and would call our code if it was our splines but now that we're using their data we thought it would be best to try to merge the two and this is essentially just zeroing everything out that we don't use for the instancing that comes with the data so um nice thing is i think let me see i'm googling something real quick i wonder if this will like uh break everything i think there's a console command for i've modified the ush file and i think i can read file but i can't remember if there is oh yes the urge file does anyone in chat now if you can what was the thing i want to recompile because i've modified the the uh local vertex factory.ush and i think i can force that while running but i don't i think i've just yeah i don't know i mean i can restart the editor but yeah that's what i do hi alert okay uh but it might also recompile everything yeah i'm just gonna restart i have done this now that i think about it have you now yeah because i did custom rendering pipeline stuff once and uh if you don't do that then it takes years it's like isn't there like recompile shader command something something um well you can't check now because you close the editor i guess yeah let me just there's a force something force recompile yeah i'm restart i'm just gonna restart the other see if this helps at all do
