> please go to the keyway site

> 
> now we really want your feedback on like
> 
> stability
> 
> for multiplayer on specifically
> 
> conveyables
> 
> um and we also chucked in a few like
> 
> surprise fixes
> 
> um we we optimized a bunch of how like
> 
> trains work in the game apparently
> 
> trains were super super expensive
> 
> uh when they were far away um
> 
> they weren't optimized at all like they
> 
> ran just
> 
> as they would if you're like using the
> 
> trains which isn't
> 
> like that's the thing with satisfactory
> 
> if everything ran
> 
> like all the time it wouldn't work like
> 
> at all
> 
> so there's so many like we remove stuff
> 
> and optimize away things when they're
> 
> far away and stuff like that
> 
> and trains didn't have that optimization
> 
> and holy [ __ ] that made a big difference
> 
> for some people
> 
> some with a bigger um say false
> 
> so we did that and we have there's still
> 
> more optimization on the train cards
> 
> apparently they are also
> 
> super expensive for some reason so
> 
> there's still more juicy optimization
> 
> things coming
> 
> uh probably this week
> 
> and i think that's state of dev we're
> 
> still working on like fixing those kind
