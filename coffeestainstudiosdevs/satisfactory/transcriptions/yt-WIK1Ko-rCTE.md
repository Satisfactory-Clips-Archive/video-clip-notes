> 
> uh yeah so the engine update is
> 
> essentially when we are upgrading the
> 
> engine
> 
> we get like a bunch of tools that we can
> 
> use when we're working on the game

>

> 
> engine so now we have to
> 
> you know add the actual bug fix so it's
> 
> it's
> 
> it's a messy process okay there's a lot
> 
> of work doing the upgrades and
> 
> doing the upgrade we also run into like

> 
> that's coming out
> 
> fingers crossed today hopefully uh if
> 
> everything goes right
> 
> uh there's been one bug today or one
> 
> crash
> 
> rather that we discovered that we wanted
> 
> to fix before we push this patch
> 
> it's very likely it's going to come out
> 
> today but you never know
> 
> and it will probably be kind of late it
> 
> seems because
> 
> this was discovered like today or
> 
> yesterday or something like that and it
> 
> was brought up to
> 
> attention today so the the way we do
> 
> patches and the way that we
> 
> like rolling out a patch for our game is
> 
> there's a lot of work
> 
> involved there's a big process involved
> 
> with it
> 
> uh and that's not including like you
> 
> know smoke testing
> 
> and like making sure that it works just
> 
> getting the patch
> 
> built and getting it out on steam and
> 
> epic
> 
> it's it's a lot of work okay the build
> 
> pipeline is not easy
> 
> um so hopefully today it will come out
> 
> to
> 
> experimental um first and foremost
> 
> and i wanna really really say disclaimer
> 
> here
> 
> this is a very experimental patch
> 
> because
> 
> we haven't been able to test everything
> 
> with that upgrade because
> 
> we're working on like so many different
> 
> versions on the game
> 
> um so the engine upgrade has been like
> 
> been its own little thing for a long
> 
> time and then we've been working on that
> 
> and then i was switched over so most
> 
> people are using it and now we like
> 
> caught up and fought fought physically
> 
> fought all the bugs that we run into um
> 
> and uh really today guys there's a cm
> 
> joke again pretty sure it's gonna be
> 
> today
> 
> it's not we had we don't have the build
> 
> ready yet which is why i'm saying maybe
> 
> not
> 
> um but we are working on it and uh as
> 
> soon as uh
> 
> the patch goes live we're gonna tweet
> 
> about it and you'll probably notice
> 
> um and uh
> 
> yeah so so but yeah so the update is
> 
> gonna come out on experimental first
> 
> because this is gonna actually be a very
> 
> experimental build
> 
> um and uh i i really really recommend if
> 
> you
> 
> if you check the twitter before the
> 
> stream you you probably saw that i
> 
> really recommend that you back up your
> 
> saves for this one okay because
> 
> um don't trust cloudsync
> 
> i've gotten a lot of messages from
> 
> people where sync uh
> 
> either didn't work uh or it's it's a
> 
> very easy
> 
> like user error to like just click the
> 
> wrong button and then it overwrites your
> 
> save files
> 
> um and this happens on both steam and
> 
> epic so like it happens regardless of
> 
> platform
> 
> so just back up your saves if you if you
> 
> really care i hate
> 
> like if i feel super sad whenever i talk
> 
> to people that reach out to us i'm like
> 
> hey is there any way to get back my save
> 
> my safe file got overridden by cloud
> 
> save
> 
> or like something happened in the game
> 
> that broke my save file
> 
> and and i got super sad because there
> 
> really isn't we can do about that
> 
> um if the safe hall gets corrupt or um
> 
> if if epic or steam overwrites your safe
> 
> files so
> 
> re really asking you guys to to back up
> 
> your saves if you if you really don't
> 
> want to lose like if you have a lot of
> 
> work like i know people that have like
> 
> thousands of hours on their safe office
> 
> hurts my heart to uh to hear people
> 
> having running into like that
> 
> uh is there a command for backing up
> 
> saves no so what you'll you're gonna
> 
> have to do is you're gonna have to go to
> 
> the folder where you have your save
> 
> files
> 
> which is in your local app data uh
> 
> factory game saved save games um
> 
> this is where you find your save files i
> 
> can actually copy paste maybe the
> 
> the command or not the command but like
> 
> the the
> 
> that was called uh
> 
> the directory uh unless someone's
> 
> already done it while i was doing this
> 
> uh usually when i have jace on he can
> 
> like
> 
> distract you guys while i look this
> 
> up or other way around
> 
> here we go uh copy
> 
> [Music]
> 
> paste five people already did it all
> 
> right
> 
> fantastic now i did it as well so now
> 
> you know i'm i'm working okay
> 
> uh so yeah you can find your save files
> 
> in that directory just copy it somewhere
> 
> on your
> 
> on your folder uh on your desk uh back
> 
> up your system32
> 
> um game save manager to run periodic
> 
> backups that sounds like a good idea i
> 
> also heard people that do like
> 
> git um like version controlling on their
> 
> save files which is pretty cool that
> 
> i do that sometimes as well
> 
> you can't trust epic and steam honestly
> 
> on the cloud side stuff like
> 
> or even if they put everything right you
> 
> just muck it up yourself with the
> 
> the cloud sync thing thinking
> 
> thingamajig um
> 
> so yeah um so that's hopefully coming
> 
> today
> 
> i don't know for sure i've been told
> 
> that they will let me know
> 
> during the stream when
> 
> when status progresses or if patch notes
> 
> are available for me to at least read
> 
> out
> 
> because there's going to be a few uh
> 
> fixes with this patch that are
> 
> not new features but like some some new
