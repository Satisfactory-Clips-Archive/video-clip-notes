> yeah any downsides of playing
>
> experimental
>
> it's a little bit more buggy yeah um
>
> other than that it's the same game yeah
>
> i think maybe we have to rethink it a
>
> little bit i don't know i'll talk to him
>
> yeah folks about it later
>
> we want to make it as seamless as
>
> possible because like but we also like
>
> because like early access that's on
>
> there well we didn't update this is a
>
> specific case because
>
> yeah because i was going to say like
>
> there's also
>
> this update that came out on
>
> experimental before this was kind of
>
> special as well because we haven't
>
> usually when we do our where our
>
> releases on experimental and stuff like
>
> that
>
> we're very like on the nose of fixing
>
> things when people point it out
>
> so like if there are big issues we're
>
> like we want to fix that as soon as
>
> possible
>
> but we we're kind of like in this weird
>
> uh state where
>
> we had stuff that we wanted to test on
>
> experimental and release
>
> uh which were the the serialization oh
>
> sorry no
>
> the parallelization to make the game
>
> more multi-threaded
>
> and we were like we want to test that
>
> early like if we wait for update three
>
> and release it on
>
> like when we do like what if there are
>
> big issues like it's a pretty big thing
>
> to to do that um so
>
> and we were in this weird state we're
>
> like but we want to spend time fixing it
>
> up so we can release update 3 as soon as
>
> possible
>
> so we decided that let's release this
>
> version that's on
>
> experimental right now and try and not
>
> like try and focus on keep working on
>
> day 3. so we at least get
>
> some version out that's updated for the
>
> community yeah um
>
> yeah but it's also like in a really
>
> weird state where it's like
>
> we can't update to experimental without
>
> updating
>
> update three like and normally like
>
> through like
>
> version control and stuff you can create
>
> different builds so that would be able
>
> to do that you can work
>
> different parallel builds but this one
>
> is a specific case
>
> yeah where it's not possible like
>
> because we upgraded the engine
>
> which is a very very big deal when it
>
> comes to game development in general
>
> because if you want to do stuff with the
>
> old version
>
> you have to like have a comp like for us
>
> in this case we have to have like a
>
> specific workstation
>
> that has that old version of the engine
>
> because
>
> it involves like having an old version
>
> of visual studio and like having it all
>
> set up
>
> to work with that engine which is like
>
> it's a big thing to just
>
> change step back and forth so we can't
>
> have someone be like
>
> just switch back and forth so like if we
>
> want to change stuff
>
> on this the version that's actually
>
> experimental right now
>
> it's like it's a lot of work it's a day
>
> of just like setting it up so you can
>
> start working on it
>
> uh unfortunately yeah uh which will not
>
> be the case
>
> hopefully in the future yeah i think i
>
> think it'll be better later yeah
