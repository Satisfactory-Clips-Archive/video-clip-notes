### Transcript

> fake hellish screws and [ __ ] got a question from told if the factories can get attacked and if you have something to defend them no it's not something we want to add to the game we want it to be a chill like building experience more so than a survival aspect type game like there there are survival aspects for sure when you're like out uh in the when you're out exploring uh but when you're like building we want to separate that more so that you don't have to defend your factories or maintain them and stuff like that it should be pretty chill to just build stuff so that won't be added to the game anytime soon
