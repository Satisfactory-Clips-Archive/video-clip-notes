> yeah and uh tom is asking about
> 
> uh how's like the colorblind uh
> 
> accessibility stuff
> 
> so oh sorry go on
> 
> hi um so the colors that we use in our
> 
> ui like
> 
> um we mainly use like orange white dark
> 
> gray and light gray
> 
> and the way we set up those colors is
> 
> that they would work
> 
> no matter what contrast or or like um
> 
> yeah like the color blindness type that
> 
> you have like it would work like you
> 
> would still be able to distinguish those
> 
> colors
> 
> um but sometimes we run into the issue
> 
> that
> 
> like the dark gray and light gray are
> 
> not clear enough or it's very boring to
> 
> use the same orange and the same gray
> 
> all the time
> 
> um so we've been like slightly
> 
> introducing different colors
> 
> um and we've talked about a color
> 
> blindness mode but
> 
> i don't think it's super necessary right
> 
> now because of how we've built it up
> 
> with the colors that we're using
> 
> basically
> 
> if that makes sense just got a for i
> 
> guess some for feedback on that i
> 
> suppose yeah
> 
> um but i did a little twitter thread and
> 
> um yeah we had a lot of like
> 
> good comments of like the colors you're
> 
> using our
> 
> okay so one thing i'd like to kind of
> 
> announce that we haven't really
> 
> said i think or is the fact that uh we
> 
> had some accessibility
> 
> issues when we launched the game yeah
> 
> and i think in the recent
> 
> experimental version we've added a few
> 
> tiny things yes that really makes a
> 
> difference i think
> 
> so we we have like a little um like high
> 
> contrast mode
> 
> uh i see that people can't hear me well
> 
> so
> 
> don't gotta talk live hey um
> 
> so we have like a little high contrast
> 
> mode uh for certain ui elements like the
> 
> compass and like the hot bar
> 
> so you can like there's a slider to to
> 
> adjust the contrast for those things in
> 
> the ui
> 
> then we have like a big inventory mode
> 
> uh so you have like
> 
> large inventory slots or small ones um
> 
> we're also doing an experimental version
> 
> of directional subtitles so if you're
> 
> hard of hearing
> 
> uh basically we have like little
> 
> subtitles that tell you what kind of
> 
> sound and on what direction
> 
> it is uh and yeah we're experimenting
> 
> with more stuff
> 
> cool super cool
>
