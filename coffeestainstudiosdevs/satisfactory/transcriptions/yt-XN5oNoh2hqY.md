### Transcript

> are you aware of the pipe issue in
>
> update for at the moment they're
>
> extremely broken for fluids at the
>
> moment what specifically
>
> is is there a pipe issue that you know
>
> of mark no
>
> no and nothing should have changed
>
> either i feel like the
>
> biggest issue or if anything with pipes
>
> is that they're not super
>
> easy to understand what's going on and i
>
> guess that's the
>
> problem with fluid dynamics in general i
>
> remember when we
>
> launched update 3 and we tried to
>
> explain like how the
>
> dylan explained like how the fluid
>
> dynamics work and
>
> we had someone like who was like a
>
> some kind of engineer and it was like
>
> i'm so glad that it's not realistic
>
> because it's like not fun to have proper
>
> proper
>
> fluid dynamics uh yeah we discussed a
>
> lot of different ways of doing it back
>
> then as well
>
> and i'm i'm not a hundred percent sure
>
> still if it's like the best way of going
>
> about it
>
> because it is complicated still yeah
>
> do you have any things that you know
>
> like
>
> do you have any idea what you would want
>
> to change with the fluid dynamics if you
>
> had to change them or
>
> no i mean that's kind of the problem
>
> right because you want all this
>
> these things that it can do you you kind
>
> of want to have the whole head lift
>
> stuff
>
> uh um which is the main thing i think
>
> that actually makes it complicated
>
> right it's like why does it flow why
>
> doesn't it flow well and it oscillates
>
> as well which is actually
>
> kind of people up that they're
>
> not directional they just go wherever
>
> they can
>
> which is what what fluids inside of
>
> pipes do
>
> but you kind of always feel that when
>
> you connect it to an output and then to
>
> an input it's just gonna go from one
>
> place to the other
>
> but depending on how you set that up and
>
> what kind of shenanigans you do
>
> it might not behave as you expect right
>
> so the question might have been to the
>
> due to the fact that we moved the model
>
> the mesh for okay so if it's the same
>
> person or not i'm not quite sure because
>
> i actually lost the previous
>
> question but they're no longer connected
>
> to my water pumps they still work but
>
> they're
>
> like skewed that has to do with the fact
>
> that the model the actual like
>
> the water extractor model was not like
>
> centered
>
> and we didn't notice this until we
>
> implemented the the uh
>
> snapping functionality to the game and
>
> when we snapped it it was like
>
> it's snapping but why is it off and then
>
> we noticed that the model was like off a
>
> little bit from this collision
>
> so that's why and and you just need to
>
> rebuild them and that's it
>
> they still work
