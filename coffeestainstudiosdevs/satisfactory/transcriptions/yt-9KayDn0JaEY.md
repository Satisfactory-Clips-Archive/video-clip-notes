> mark six conveyor belt yeah so that's tied into that as well so the reason why we don't have mark six conveyor belts is because of that precision issue where the faster things move on belts um the more kind of obvious that problem becomes like the more that precision matters so if the the if you have a slow frame rate that will be even more significantly bad essentially um so so yeah that's why we don't have mark six belts yet that's something that we need to address and i know that we have like miners where you know the miners you can't output an overclocked mark iii miner on a belt because we don't have fast enough belts and that's something that we're going to address at some point whether that is that we add you know another output or something to the minor or if we slow down all the belts and change the whole balance of the game um we don't know yet it depends on the precision of it
