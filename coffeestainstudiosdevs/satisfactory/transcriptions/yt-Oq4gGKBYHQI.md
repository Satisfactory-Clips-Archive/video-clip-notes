> i saw someone before was asking about

> like map editor and stuff like that
>
> um that's a mild heart attack um
>
> every time we hear it but no
>
> not really no if that happens it's going
>
> to be like the mega distant future i
>
> don't think anyone should really
>
> think about it like obviously think
>
> about it because it's kind of cool right
>
> but
>
> um holy [ __ ] yeah
>
> but like that's not a i don't think
>
> anyone is going to even remotely think
>
> of that right
>
> now there's so many more important
>
> things yeah
>
> it's partly because the lavish level
>
> streaming we're using is so complex
>
> so it's really hard to like kind of use
>
> that system
>
> in a good way
>
> we we hardly do it in a good way
>
> uh we made some i checked that part of
>
> the code yesterday we've done some weird
>
> hacks
>
> with the level streaming stuff uh
>
> for some reason it's mostly for
>
> multiplayer because like you're not
>
> supposed to
>
> uh unreal engine doesn't really have
>
> out-of-the-box support for listen server
>
> streaming which is what we're doing
>
> where like
>
> the way it works is like client and
>
> server they'll stream the level
>
> depending on where they are
>
> but the server also needs to stream the
>
> part where the client is at because they
>
> need to be able to do stuff
>
> and the server needs to authenticate
>
> that stuff so the server needs to stream
>
> both every client's world where they are
>
> right now
>
> but also itself uh which is kind of
>
> weird because
>
> usually you have a dedicated server that
>
> just loads everything all the time
>
> and then yeah it keeps track of all that
>
> but we do it
>
> on a need to need basis and uh yeah it's
>
> pretty
>
> pretty a lot of work went into that it's
