### Transcript

> We're also adding nitrogen gas to the game
> Which can be extracted from a new resource node type
> we've added called &quot;Resource Wells&quot;
> Resource Wells consist of a main node and
> nearby satellite nodes
> You simply place the pressurizer on the main node
> That then activates the satellite nodes
> Which can then be extracted via pipes using an Extractor
> Oil and water Resource Wells will also be added
> As an additional method of extracting oil and water
