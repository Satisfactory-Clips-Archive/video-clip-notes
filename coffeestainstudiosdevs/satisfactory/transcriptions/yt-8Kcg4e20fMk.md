> that would be pretty good
>
> i'm on yeah exactly it is tedious like
>
> it really sucks
>
> uh but you know and it's it's good for
>
> those who are here at the stream or
>
> follow us on
>
> social media or see our videos or
>
> whatever
>
> uh who can hear these solutions but
>
> there's like a lot of people playing
>
> that probably don't ever get to see this
>
> stuff and they're just like
>
> i lose my items and then they just quit
>
> playing which really sucks
>
> i think we're gonna fix that issue very
>
> soon
>
> uh that's good because so that
>
> it's it's not it's like it's not really
>
> been a bug because we have
>
> like made it there's been an
>
> issue or there's been a reason why it's
>
> been like that for such a long time and
>
> it's because
>
> uh the biggest reason why we don't why
>
> we keep
>
> your player out in the world so to speak
>
> is because when you reload back in oh
>
> like when you rejoin someone save you
>
> shouldn't have to like run back
>
> to like if you're on the other side of
>
> the map you shouldn't have to like run
>
> back to it
>
> um so what we do is we connect that with
>
> your online
>
> session id right and when you're playing
>
> quote unquote offline or when you're
>
> playing alone you're still playing
>
> online because you are
>
> open for connectivity so to speak that's
>
> why
>
> we are that's why the game is online
>
> even though it's not offline
>
> [Music]
>
> and right now yeah everything's tied
>
> into that session id
>
> if you play offline we don't have a
>
> session id so we can't tie you with
>
> anything apart from like maybe you know
>
> like maybe your windows name or your
>
> computer name or you know there's a
>
> something that identifies you um and
>
> uh something that we did for the steam
>
> release was
>
> better connectivity with that session id
>
> to like connect it better with
>
> you know who the local player is as well
>
> so we've started working on a bit of a
>
> fix
>
> for that it's just that we need to make
>
> a decision on like
>
> you know uh what happens if you
>
> like join in you have a different site
>
> like
>
> all those cases we just need to make a
>
> take a stance on it
>
> but the local one i'm pretty sure is
>
> is like we can store like your latest
>
> session at the end and
>
> connect it with that when you're playing
>
> offline so you don't get run into that
>
> issue
>
> if you're playing alone
>
> thanks
