### Transcript

> Will there be procedurally generated resource locations?
> There will be no procedurally generated maps or resources
> I have no idea if that's something that's going to change in the future or not.
> A lot of people have expressed some concerns that if there is no procedural generation
> there will be no replayability but please understand that we have kept replayability in mind during development and we have some plans for it.
> But of course, we're still welcome to suggestions. Especially suggestions that don't require procedural generation!
