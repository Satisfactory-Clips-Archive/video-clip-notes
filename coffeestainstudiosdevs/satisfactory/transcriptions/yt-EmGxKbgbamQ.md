> the game requires high internet bandwidth does the lawn multiplayer mode possible so fun fact it doesn't actually solve anything um technically it could um but here's the thing with netcode it's complicated uh you can't always solve every problem with just higher bandwidth uh and that is definitely the case with satisfactory unfortunately a lot of the like nine out of ten issues with the network in in satisfactory are because of the systems um and how they function so we need to solve that because we've i mean we play the game on local area networks and we don't really like we you can actually do this yourself as well um if you disable of uh online mode um and uh use open and then the ip you connect through lan and we do that all the time and we actually don't see a difference so it doesn't actually solve problems by just put like throwing more bandwidth at it it's not a throw put issues most of the time it's it's like managing the replication that's the issue in most cases some things are like obviously it's better in some cases but it's not enough to warrant us making like a lawn land setting thing because that gives us more issues more potential issues if we add that to the base game so that's why we haven't done that because we want everything to go through the same system so we have one system to sort of debug quote unquote i'm dumbing it down a bit but that's that's sort of why we don't have lan as a setting
