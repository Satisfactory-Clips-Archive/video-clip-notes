### Transcript

> every week you mean update five oh yes i also realized i probably soon will probably have to update the bot that we have on our channel um because update four is out there's still a few things that we're working on related to update 4 but for the most part most of the people working here at coffee stain studios have moved on to update 5 working on update 5 working on update 5 features um etc etc it's still way too early to announce anything or anything like that um i'm just going to like give you a sit rep on sort of what we're doing currently and uh once we have an announcement to make about update five we're gonna do it but um it's it's still a bit too early so i'm really like grasping for straws here
