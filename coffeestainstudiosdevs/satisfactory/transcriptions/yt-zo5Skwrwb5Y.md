### Transcript

> i think sometimes hello which one is
> 
> uh better from a frame rate performance
> 
> point of view
> 
> uh conveyor buses trains or motor
> 
> vehicles not vehicles
> 
> yes trains might be better for frame
> 
> rate uh
> 
> yes because trains don't do the the
> 
> wheel thing right or the
> 
> the the simulation of uh
> 
> what's it called yeah yeah no they don't
> 
> even do the no no no they don't do the
> 
> traces or anything
> 
> is that called chase the tracing no yeah
> 
> but for
> 
> for this the the thing you know in the
> 
> wheel
> 
> yeah the sweep for suspension
> 
> right yeah the suspension sweeps yeah
> 
> yeah never mind anyway
> 
> yeah they don't yeah that's the most
> 
> expensive
> 
> thing for the vehicles and i don't think
> 
> trains do that
> 
> no so in that regard it's better but
> 
> vehicles uh trains
> 
> still do um
> 
> it depends like it really depends
> 
> because if you have one train
> 
> that that is huge it's in the
> 
> like there's there's better purposes
> 
> right like if you're if you're
> 
> transporting if you've got a massive
> 
> conveyor bust transporting a bajillion
> 
> pieces of aura of varying kinds you know
> 
> two kilometers long
> 
> that's gonna be more you know you could
> 
> you could reduce that down to trains
> 
> much like much more easily that's gonna
> 
> perform better
> 
> and you may even end up having a very
> 
> similar outcome in terms of your
> 
> performance depending on how you do it
> 
> in terms of your production
> 
> so it all depends on the case however in
> 
> general
> 
> for fps the motor vehicles
> 
> are the heaviest for sure they were
> 
> never designed for you to have like
> 
> 30 of them running or anything like 80.
> 
> as
> 
> some people have i'm looking at you
> 
>  you know who i'm talking about
> 
> like there were 80 like factory cars
> 
> running around and yeah
> 
> and there are some optimization stuff
> 
> that we just like don't understand why
> 
> they've been unticked because
> 
> so there's stuff to improve there as
> 
> well but generally they're pretty
> 
> expensive
> 
> but i think like multiplayer-wise also
> 
> because
> 
> the it might not be when you compare
> 
> trains and
> 
> um conveyor belts like big
> 
> um what's it called yeah whatever
> 
> a lot of conveyor belts uh there's also
> 
> the aspect of multiplayer where when
> 
> you're syncing all those belts that's
> 
> like one of the most expensive
> 
> things in multiplayer is the conveyor
> 
> belts so
> 
> having one train and they're replicating
> 
> that train alone
> 
> is better than replicating you know like
> 
> a bunch of conveyor belts
> 
> but it really depends uh how the setup
> 
> is
