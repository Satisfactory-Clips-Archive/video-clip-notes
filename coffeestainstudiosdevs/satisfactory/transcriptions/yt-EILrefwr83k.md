> have
>
> update four be rolled out um later

>
> um to things we already have in the game

> four
>
> um but here's the catch

>
> um what update four will be
>

>
> we have an idea but i'm not gonna say
>
> what it is
>
> because we're we're kind of like in in a

>

>
> so that we can develop the things for
>
> update 4
>
> and update 5 even things
>
> like we're upgrading the save system

>
> that's that's in the future um but
>

>
> we're doing updates to multiplayer we're

> doing
>
> an engine upgrade right now we're on
>
> unreal engine
>
> 4.22 we're right now upgrading it to

> 4.23
>
> that's gonna take a while because we

>
> quite a few alterations to epic's
>
> unreal engine so that we can run
>
> satisfactory
>
> on it we have some special needs for it
>
> um
>
> and right now we're kind of like going
>
> through
>
> that like merch process
>
> and like for instance we we in our save

>
> you're a programmer maybe you know what
>
> i'm talking about
>
> uh which didn't exist in unreal engine
>
> 422 uh so we implemented that ourselves

> epic has now
>

>
> once we have that all set up and once we

>
> um so so yes the uh

>
> um and there are still
>
> believe it or not there are actually
>
> still a few people on the programming
>
> team even that are still
>
> having a vacation or i think they have
>
> like a
>
> it's even they have a prolonged vacation

> um
>
> or they have like a their vacation
