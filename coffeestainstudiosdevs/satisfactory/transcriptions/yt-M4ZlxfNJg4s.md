> Snutt:Yeah
Jace: Yeah, when can I change the key bindings

> 
> Jace: I don't think
Snutt: Ahh
> 
> Jace: Do we have keybinds?
> 
> Jace: yeah?
> 
> Snutt: We- I mean we have, but I thought you could-
I thought we added that in a patch a while back,
> 
> Snutt:  but maybe we didn't because that's not
the first time I've gotten that question in recently.
> 
> Jace: Okay.
> 
> Jace: Can anyone else confirm? - if you can rebind
your key?
> 
> Snutt: Well specifically Ctrl and Shifts and
Left Shifts.
> 
> Snutt: Maybe you can't right now, but I think
we have plans for that.
> 
> Jace: Oh.
> 
> Jace: I see, I see.
Snutt: I'll have to check with uhh, the person.
