> meant to yeah procedure is really hard
>
> to get balanced
>
> um but it's also like the
>
> i remember talking to um
>
> [Music]
>
> go on
>
> wait
>
> i have iron ore yeah but but uh i need
>
> to
>
> turn it into things
>
> which i don't have
>
> like i don't i need a crafting bench for
>
> that unless i have enough for a crafting
>
> bench
>
> revenge those are actually i actually do
>
> i actually do
>
> this this is totally not like necessary
>
> but we have committed so

>
> wants to become one with nature my god
>
> how much do i have so so i remember this
>
> discussion i had with oscar stolberg who
>
> is
>
> uh who makes a lot of procedural games
>
> um
>
> and one one point he brought up was like
>
> um
>
> like procedural generation it's really
>
> hard to make like
>
> really like detailed
>
> like exceptions to the procedure
>
> generation like
>
> once you've generated it's more like a
>
> breadth first
>
> rather than depth first when you use
>
> bread
>
> because like you can make a lot of stuff
>
> but it's hard to make like you know
>
> uniquely one uniquely thing right so
>
> like it's easy to make a big world
>
> which is like never ending and it's but
>
> it's it's going to be repeating
>
> like and then you want that detail and
>
> then that detail is really hard to do
>
> like even stupid [ __ ] i've just built up
>
> sorry man
>
> i'm just stopping you right now but yeah
>
> so i've built these two things
>

>
> nicely done you did it um yeah so it's
>
> like
>
> you like stuff is going to be repeating
>
> even no man's sky has that issue where
>
> like
>
> especially in the beginning of when they
>
> release that game it was like a lot of
>
> stuff repeats
>
> um and your game has to accommodate for
>
> that
>
> so it becomes like a really big part of
>
> the game design
>
> because it needs to be part of the
>
> procedural generation aspect of it
>
> it becomes a pain in my ass
