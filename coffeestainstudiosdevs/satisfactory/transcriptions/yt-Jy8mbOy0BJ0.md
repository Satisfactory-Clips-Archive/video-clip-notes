>
> i we haven't really considered it i
>
> don't know we haven't just talked about
>
> it i
>
> i think to some degree it would make
>
> sense because it's really hard to like
>
> you know in under two hours
>
> because like the main argument yeah like
>
> the argument is like you can use the
>

> you got this oh it's so i i just want to
>
> get through the fog plane oh my god it
>
> just
>
> never ends
>
> all right two hours would get you to two
>
> or five that's not
>
> that's not true i saw a speedrun of
>
> someone i'm sure it's true for some
>
> people
>
> yeah but that's not true i sure didn't
>
> get to tier five in
>
> under two hours i saw a speedrun of
>
> someone getting to tier seven in less
>

>
> but they cheated they used they used a
