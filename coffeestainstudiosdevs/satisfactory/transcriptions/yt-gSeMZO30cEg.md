> um food update seems a bit bigger than i
>
> thought yeah
>
> it is a big update like it's you know we
>
> we've
>
> done updates often like sometimes every
>
> two weeks and stuff but they're just
>
> like minor updates where there's a fix
>
> or a tiny thing added but
>
> uh these bigger updates the reason they
>
> get clumped into one big one isn't
>
> because we're like
>
> we're gonna have a big event and have
>
> this really big update for whatever
>
> it's because we have no choice because
>
> when we start making a change to the
>
> game
>
> and in the engine uh the versions of the
>
> game start deviating so much that you
>
> can't
>
> or it's unreasonable to keep merging
>
> things back into the
>
> old one and cutting out the new features
>
> that we're working on to try and make
>
> the two compatible
>
> when we're going to ditch the old
>
> version anyway and go with the new
>
> version so
>
> uh these kind of so like the reason it's
>
> coming out then is because that's when
>
> we should be done with what's in it so
>
> uh you you'll notice that we had like
>
> pretty much no updates
>
> not many at all in the past like month
>
> or two and it's
>
> because of this problem where we want to
>
> make some big changes to the game
>
> and we have no choice but to package
>
> them together so that we can
>
> actually make it it's not that feasible
>
> otherwise
>
> yeah um yeah not really a choice it's
>
> yeah
>
> because it really is like a more of a
>
> long-term goal
>
> rather than like trying to spit out
>
> updates all the time because if we spit
>
> out updates like all the time then
>
> there's so much work that goes into just
>
> like both quality assuring it and like
>
> making
>
> making it happen uh production wise that
>
> it just
>
> like it drains the production of the
>
> game long term
>
> so we'd rather focus on the long term
>
> goals
>
> which is 1.0 yeah
