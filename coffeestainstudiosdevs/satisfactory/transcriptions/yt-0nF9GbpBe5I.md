> maybe it feels like at least or you're
> 
> i'm trying to be as much help as i can
>

> obtuse about it
> 
> unless it's like something we don't want
> 
> to spoil a surprise
> 
> yeah then we don't talk about it but
> 
> otherwise
> 
> i'm just open and say what we do and
> 
> sending code snippets
> 
> this is how we do it and then people
> 
> usually find a
> 
> workaround because like
> 
> i'm so so amazed by this model community
> 
> we have new modding support we have
> 
> done basically nothing else then send
> 
> them some more information and that
> 
> makes
> 
>  amazing we do i noticed that we
> 
> have like some like small file in the
> 
> game that like tells the
> 
> the what's it called not the headers
> 
> maybe but
> 
> the uh yeah community resources yes yeah
> 
> and
> 
> we add that for like because people were
> 
> yeah exactly because
> 
> people were asking the wiki people then
> 
> tended to ask
> 
> about values of stuff yeah and they
> 
> instead
> 
> and they had we decided to do all the
> 
> packages
> 
> unencrypted so instead of them just
> 
> going through
> 
> and uh data mine it
> 
> i went on a few nights when i
> 
> had didn't want to do anything else i
> 
> just sat there and made a
> 
> json exporter and then exported the data
> 
> yeah and then
> 
> we have i made a short little snippet
> 
> that just copies all
> 
> our headers in from the game and just
> 
> puts them in there system and puts them
> 
> so modders can get them and
> 
> uh do there's plus cost modding support
> 
> better but how does that help
> 
> them like does it just give them access
> 
> to stuff that they can
> 
> call or
> 
> don't know exactly what they do i've
> 
> tried to
> 
> like understand what they're doing but i
> 
> think panacatta has a better idea of
> 
> what they're doing
> 
> mean i hope we made a model yeah yeah
> 
> but from what i understand is people
> 
> used from the beginning we ship the
> 
> pdbs that is basically the debug symbols
> 
> from the game so
> 
> from there you can extract all functions
> 
> all function names and all variables
> 
> and then instead of them just reverse
> 
> engineering those
> 
> things and recreating because all
> 
> objects in the game need to have this
> 
> the mods
> 
> need to have the same data layout as our
> 
> game
> 
> and our headers help them to give us the
> 
> exact data
> 
> layout of everything so then they can
> 
> just take
> 
> the data that we have in the game and do
> 
> other stuff with it than we do
> 
> right so and like figure out oh there's
> 
> a function that does this and then
> 
> they change how what it's actually doing
> 
> pretty good yeah
