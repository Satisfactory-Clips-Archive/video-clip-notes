### Transcript

> um what are the advantages of packaging it's it's i mean i don't know i mean i mean so i think the biggest advantage is when you need to move a lot of liquid up like vertically the packager makes it so that you can run the liquid on conveyor belts essentially and just transport them up because conveyor belts are free power wise but pumps are expensive and you need so many pumps if you're going like really high so like in that sense i think it's really good to use the packager the only downside of that is that you need so many packages to make up for the same kind of volume um so like in that sense i don't know if you actually gain a lot of like or save much power i don't know but like when i play on my 5x5 challenge for instance when you can only build on a 5x5 grid like it's a must-have because right now i'm stuck with the fact that i have to build so many pumps for each pipe um and just go through everything up uh and yeah you can sink packaged water and and linguists as well so like you can't sink um liquids right now uh and the only liquid you can't package uh and that's gonna be the same in the update uh is sulfuric acid i believe that's like the only one you can package and ergo being the only package uh the only fluid you can't um sink so yeah i mean and it's kind of up to you if you want to use the package or not it's not like something that you must have to progress the game right it's just like a it gives you more options essentially to how you want to construct your stuff typical dsd dog should get devs yeah
