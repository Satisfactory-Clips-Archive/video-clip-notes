> is the game cpu heavy or gpu heavy or
> 
> both
> 
> uh i i i'd like to say gpu heavy
> 
> more so it's cpu as well so actually
> 
> like it the
> 
> um there there is a lot of objects in
> 
> the scene
> 
> uh because when you have a big factory
> 
> and just going over those
> 
> objects it's it's a big task so
> 
> that is demand it depends on your your
> 
> pc what will be the limiting factor in
> 
> the end but it's kind of heavy on both
> 
> sides
> 
> or it can be because it seems to me that
> 
> it really
> 
> also depends on how you build as well
> 
> because i've seen some safes that i've
> 
> gotten where like holy the gpu
> 
> thread is
> 
> off the chain uh and then others were
> 
> like
> 
> oh this is totally fine rendering wise
> 
> but then like holy there's so much
> 
> processing going on the cpu uh and i
> 
> now that i'm community manager i'm like
> 
> i don't get i'm not gonna look
> 
> into why that's the case um
> 
> so so it it's also kind of it's also
> 
> kind of problematic when we are
> 
> optimizing for because our
> 
> our game is problematic to optimize for
> 
> because it's so open-ended in terms of
> 
> where the problem may lie like it's
> 
> easier when it's like yeah we use
> 
> baked lighting and you're in this close
> 
> environment and like
> 
> like yeah absolutely it's yeah
> 
> we we never know what the player will
> 
> we'll be doing
> 
> um like because it's earl access as well
> 
> we don't know even what we will be doing
> 
> so it's
> 
> it's uh it's a hard uh problem
> 
> yeah but a lot a lot of times we'll be
> 
> like
> 
> we we often collect save files from
> 
> community and i
> 
> i just chunk them over to our technical
> 
> artist and he runs that in like a test
> 
> bed or test bench kind of where
> 
> just run through and checks like is it
> 
> still the same issue and he usually
> 
> reports to
> 
> programmers or he fixes things if he
> 
> feels like yeah this is something i can
> 
> work on
> 
> um so we're i think that's been
> 
> pretty good process for us in general as
> 
> well to like find
> 
> issues apart from the things that we
> 
> know of so to speak or like
> 
> we theory we theorize about a lot of
> 
> things like this isn't the best way to
> 
> do it and this is the way it's done
> 
> right now
> 
> and it will probably affect like
> 
> whatever whatever uh but a lot of cases
> 
> it's like
> 
> practical getting someone saved file and
> 
> be like yeah this sounds like
> 
> garbage um yeah and it helps a lot with
> 
> probably
> 
> prioritization if we if we actually have
> 
> data that shows that
> 
> hey this is the limiting factor for this
> 
> many players or
> 
> every player that played more than 40
> 
> hours like this starts become limiting
> 
> factor
> 
> or like something like that it would
> 
> help a lot we don't have the perfect
> 
> data for that more quantitative
> 
> kind of stuff but having those save
> 
> files gives a lot of insight still on
> 
> yeah
