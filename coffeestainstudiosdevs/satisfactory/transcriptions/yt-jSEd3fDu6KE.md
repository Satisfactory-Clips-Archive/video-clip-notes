> the that someone was gonna say
>
> uh clearly didn't matter oh yeah the
>
> video the video last week you guys um
>
> with ben and the optimization
>
> you saw some stuff about world update
>
> you saw just just some
>
> you know what just a couple of many many
>
> things that can be done to optimize the
>
> game
>
> i don't know if you saw the video i'm
>
> going to link it
>
> no i didn't watch it what was it about
>
> yeah it was nothing important
>
> you wouldn't understand okay so uh it
>
> was really awesome so like there was
>
> some
>
> you get some examples of how we've done
>
> some things to optimize stuff
>
> and also some new features that are
>
> going to be coming into the game as well
>
> um and i think it's really interesting
>
> to for the optimization stuff because i
>
> think i don't know i i
>
> could be wrong here but i think that you
>
> know there's a lot of people who you
>
> know you play games you're not game
>
> developers though and so you might not
>
> really
>
> recognize what in what ways optimization
>
> can come about
>
> and i think ben does a great job at um
>
> uh demonstrating that like for example
>
> removing animations and replacing them
>
> with mathematical animations instead
>
> which then have almost no they take
>
> almost no space like they're
>
> they're not assets that have to be
>
> created or stored in memory or anything
>
> like that they're just calculated on the
>
> fly
>
> and like things like pumps and stuff
>
> those animations are all just math
>
> no one animated them um you know little
>
> things like that uh which
>
> which add up and he talks about some
>
> other things as well um
>
> yeah it's just really nifty it's it's a
>
> mixed bag of just some cool stuff some
>
> uh knowledge uh some eye candy um
>
> yeah it showed off a little bit from the
>
> uh like the
>
> water changes that's coming to use yes
>
> screen space like reflections on the
>
> walls
>
> the caustics in the water there's the
>
> water is now going to have a flow
>
> so when you sit you sit in it you're
>
> going to float down the river and so are
>
> hogs and things like that
>
> he's created some really cool tools to
>
> uh for our designers our world designers
>
> uh
>
> just just to just grab a thing in the
>
> world and drag it up and down and they
>
> can change the uh
>
> the uh the calmness of the water or make
>
> it like really busy and things it's just
>
> a lot of really awesome tools that have
>
> made things easier
>
> um it's actually crazy to see what one
>
> like he's a tech artist right and this
>
> is sort of a role that i think not
>
> everyone understands
>
> like i didn't really in a way i still
>
> don't like i'm blown away at what he
>
> did he has done uh and how many areas of
>
> the game his his
>
> expertise touches so you know this is
>
> like one guy and he's just he's made
>
> things look cool he makes things run
>
> quicker he makes
>
> just things easier to iterate over the
>
> world for the other developers
>
> um tech artists are the real mvp yeah i
>
> think you're right
>
> um yeah and it's very different also
>
> from studio exactly what
>
> tech guard does um even between like
>
> because simon was previous tech art
>
> like even between simon and ben like
>
> they still they did various
>
> different things you'll notice that the
>
> game has gotten much better now yeah
>
> i'm kidding yeah um yeah it's just uh
>
> an i a little bit under appreciated role
>
> i'd say
>
> a very and i think mostly because it's
>
> misunderstood i think yeah
>
> totally yeah and like these imposter
>
> things that you're showing right now on
>
> the stream
>
> uh i think they were great and simon
>
> created a really good tool
>
> uh in his i think his own time for it
>
> yeah he made a tool that automatically
>
> see that really stupid looking model
>
> there
>
> and there they're called um imposters
>
> and
>
> watch the video if you want to learn
>
> more i'll link it again
>
> and simon created a tool that
>
> automatically creates them and textures
>
> them for you
>
> it's crazy so like you just take the
>
> model and then you just
>
> make the imposter using simon's tool so
>
> simon is the real
>
> imposter factory poor simon when is
>
> simon
>
> says i can't wait i'm not sure it won't
>
> come sooner
>
> yeah so check out that video it's really
>
> good um
>
> it contains some goodies yeah he ben is
>
> the only tech artist yeah
>
> and a lot of the a lot of our roles we
>
> have very very few people like we're a
>
> pretty small studio
>
> uh even with animation um we only have
>
> one animator
>
> or i think we have another now uh
>
> because
>
> the one that we had is moving on um
>
> but basically he he was the only one
>
> we've ever had like almost for
>
> the entire satisfactory and yeah we have
>
> a lot of like people who get a lot of
>
> work done even though they're just you
>
> know one or two people
>
