> is that why you can't ride the drones sort of um we we when we made the drones we had like uh like do we want to add you know proper blockage sort of speak on the drones to be like you're not able to ride them at all so the game like pushes you off or do we want to like make it possible for you to ride the drones and and we came up with was let's just leave it as it is and people want to try and ride the drones and we'll see what happens you know kind of with the the god what is it called in game actually the freight transport thing on the hub um like you can stand on that and you get like blasted off but like you know and that shows you like how broken the world is if you so yeah the drop ship is that what it's called in game because it has a very different name in in engine or in game like in editor that is called drop pod because we had no other dropbot at the time and then we added an actual drop pod and then the crash sites are called draw pods so like it's very confusing
