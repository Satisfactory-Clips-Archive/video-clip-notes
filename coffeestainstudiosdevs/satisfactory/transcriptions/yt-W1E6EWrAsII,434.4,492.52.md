### Transcript

> How will verticality affect the game?
> There is no height limit .. or there kind of is; It's the skybox and
> Is Uzu, our QA tester has actually hit the skybox before when messing around
> but we may enforce that in the future
> because you know, it could break the game will cause performance issues, but I don't know like maybe that's fun
> Maybe we should just leave it as it is. What do you think?
> Maybe tell us what you think in the comments below as for how verticality affects the game
> it is actually crucial to Satisfactory, it's our biggest advantage for being in 3d. Right?
> What it does is it allows players to build bigger factories in a smaller surface area
> And so if 35 square kilometres sounds a little small to you ...
> Which some people have said
> Please take verticality into account
> If that's still a problem we can make the map 35 by 35 kilometers.
> I really hope people get that reference and don't actually expect that...!
