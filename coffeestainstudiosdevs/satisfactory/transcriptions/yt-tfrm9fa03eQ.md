> 
> experimental for too long
> 
> i think it's gonna be like comparably
> 
> much quicker than the previous ones
> 
> because
> 
> i think we feel pretty confident about
> 
> that because once that is out of the way
> 
> we want to move over the fluid stuff to
> 
> the early access and then we want to
> 
> push the engine upgrade to experimental
> 
> and that will probably stick on
> 
> experiments a little bit longer because
> 
> that's a bit more experimental
> 
> and that's also happening in november or
> 
> like that's happening in november at
> 
> some point
> 
> [Music]
> 
> so so i don't think the fluid update
> 
> will be
> 
> too long on experimental but uh famous
> 
> last words i guess
> 
> yeah i like how the uh the morning folks
> 
> are kind of like yeah
> 
> we'll notice the engine change don't
> 
> worry yeah yeah the modern people will
> 
> probably notice it
> 
> everything starts breaking yeah yeah
> 
> yeah
