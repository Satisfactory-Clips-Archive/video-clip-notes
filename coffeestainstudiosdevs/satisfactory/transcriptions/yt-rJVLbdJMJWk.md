> 
> overweigh
> 
> you know that aspect of like it will
> 
> break people's save files
> 
> or um if will
> 
> impact you know something that makes the

> people's save files
> 
> pipes was such a huge feature and such a
> 
> good
> 
> feature that we felt like okay we feel
> 
> confident enough to like be able to like
> 
> implement that and have you know the

> 
> updates to the game where we change how
> 
> the save structure works and stuff like
> 
> that
> 
> and um
> 
> from those type of updates you don't
>

> 
> us so to speak when we keep developing
> 
> the game and we have one of those things
> 
> coming but we're not gonna like break
> 
> your saves we're actually gonna
> 
> we're making a system so that it
> 
> migrates your save files to the new save
> 
> system so to speak so trademark
> 
> hopefully
> 
> nothing should happen um
> 
> and this is part of the the sub-level
> 
> saving system that i mentioned
> 
> previously so it's not really a leak
> 
> so always back up your saves um
> 
> that is who boy cannot stress how
> 
> important that is because
> 
> i honestly okay this is quite important
> 
> i think everybody watching right now
> 
> this is
> 
> this is really important back up your
> 
> saves all right because
> 
> um i get a lot of dms from people where
> 
> their saves like get corrupted because
> 
> of the steam
> 
> cloud saving it gets corrupted because
> 
> of epic's cloud saving
> 
> sometimes people's hard drives fail um

> [Music]
> 
> we've had one issue where the game
> 
> like we have a lot of systems that make
> 
> sure that
> 
> when we're saving we're not corrupting
> 
> anything but we've had one location or
> 
> at least that's been reported so far
> 
> where like the the safe hall just
> 
> corrupted um
> 
> and it should crash but it didn't um
> 
> so i reckon really recommend backing up
> 
> your safety it doesn't have to be like
> 
> you know something super advanced like i
> 
> see a lot of people
> 
> saying like one driver google drive or
> 
> something just make a copy of your save
> 
> file from time to time
> 
> or something like that um or if you know
> 
> that like if you played
> 
> like especially for those people that
> 
> played for like 600 hours like come on
> 
> don't let that work out a waste because
> 
> we're incompetent or or steam or epic or
> 
> incompetent or whatever
>

> 
> um so yeah so yeah make sure to back up
> 
> your
> 
> your say file from time to time um
> 
> 950 hours yeah i've i'd i'd back up that
