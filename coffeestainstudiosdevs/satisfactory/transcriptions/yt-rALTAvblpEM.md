> this water looks better people saying
> 
> that they like this water better
> 
> you know what don't be mean i don't i
> 
> don't agree
> 
> uh i think uh like compared so so one
> 
> thing also that
> 
> needs to be pointed out um like the
> 
> the world design that's out on the build
> 
> right now
> 
> that's not as good as it looks right now
> 
> like in the actual build because we have
> 
> the
> 
> world branch that the our ui
> 
> our level designers are working on like
> 
> that is
> 
> way the video with ben right that's what
> 
> the water is like now but it's not
> 
> public yeah so if you wanted to see if
> 
> you want to see what the new water is
> 
> going to look like
> 
> i'll i'll grab that that video real
> 
> quick for you guys yeah and it's a video
> 
> that i i did with our tech artist
> 
> and he uh talks a bit about um
> 
> the the water updates
> 
> so so yeah like the the even in the
> 
> world right now because i
> 
> when i was doing this there's a few uh
> 
> instagram poems
> 
> coming up where i take one shot of the
> 
> world
> 
> in this build and then i compare it to
> 
> what it looks like in the actual build
> 
> and it looks like so much better and
> 
> sent that to hannah
> 
> and then hannah was like yeah and this
> 
> is what it looks like in our version of
> 
> the game
> 
> that's not out and it looks so much
> 
> better even compared to what's out
> 
> currently yeah so there's there's so
> 
> much juicy stuff coming to the world
> 
> um and when that comes out i don't know
> 
> but uh new water looks bad you don't
> 
> know that because you haven't seen it
> 
> yeah oh unless you just checked on the
> 
> video then you have seen it
> 
> it doesn't look bad you look bad yeah so
> 
> another thing to point out i guess like
> 
> this because like this version has
> 
> screen space uh you just checked it yeah
> 
> reflection
> 
> um which is like one of the things we
> 
> had to get rid of
> 
> uh from this build to the current one
> 
> because of performance issues
> 
> and now we're reintroducing it where we
> 
> actually fix it
>
