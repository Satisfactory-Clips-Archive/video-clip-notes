### Transcript

> another reason you'll want
> power storage and why this is
> significant is because there's actually
> going to be a change to
> the geothermal generators okay so
> previously
> you know they they're kind of boring
> that you put them down and then they
> just give you power
> there's not not really anything to them
> so we've actually we're actually making
> changes to geothermal
> in update four and uh what's gonna
> happen is
> they're they're now gonna be producing a
> like dynamic power it's
> it previously it was just 200 megawatts
> uh now it's going to be something like a
> range
> between 100 and 300 megawatts averaging
> out to be 200 megawatts but it's not
> going to be a steady kind of power
> source anymore and now power storage
> is something that you can take advantage
> of in order to smooth out
> the power generation of the geothermal
> generators if you wish you don't have to
> do that if you don't want to but
> you can use it to sort of bring back
> some stability when it comes to using
> geothermal generators
> so uh that's up to you to use that if
> you wish to use it we're pretty
> interested to see
> what people will do with that and uh
