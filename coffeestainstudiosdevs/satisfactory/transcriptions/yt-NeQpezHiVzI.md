### Transcript

> uh we add more to the map so the way things are currently is that um uh this is also something we explained a while back in another video but we have like kind of like two or three different branches that we're working on currently um one of one is like the update for stuff that's coming next year uh probably in in february or march and then we have the rural branch which is like uh hannah and and the level designers are working on fixing the world and making it look pretty and you know adding floating rocks etc um and they're working separately kind of and then you have like the engine upgrade the modular build stuff that's coming also next year for mods uh not official mod support but you know something that will make modding a little bit easier than it currently is and uh they kind of work separately so we can't really like push everything at the same time but so the world branch is is working separately there's another reason for that as well is because um there are some issues every time we push a world update it essentially populates the world um and it doesn't break your save or anything like that it could to potentially make it hard to move around your factories or it might like swallow your factories and stuff like that and it's a bit of an issue because there are certain places in the world where we like aren't done with the world like there's this on top of the uh the mountain in in the dune desert for instance like there's just like a flat texture there there's nothing there uh there's gonna be stuff there right and uh the more often we push world fixes the more often people will run into issues like that where suddenly there's just like there'll be a big thing there essentially i saw a video of someone where just a big mountain had spawned like around their their space elevator so they couldn't get out and stuff like that um and essentially the more often we push world stuff like that the more often that will happen um so we're gonna try and like save the world updates to uh like pick and choose when that happens um so they won't be super often i don't think they will make it for update 4 but i think the next update might get some world updates i'm not quite sure so we'll see um
