> is it possible to have steam workshop in the game uh it's possible but i don't know if we're gonna go that down that route honestly because we have modding that's like on both epic and on steam we've had mod modding and epic for a long time and then we'll be released on steam the modders had to like make it so that it works on steam as well and it's a kind of generic system right now with the mod loader and if we were to implement you know steam workshop or stuff like that then we want to support that just equally as much on the epic side of things and if i don't know how that's going to affect the ecosystem of mods currently um and we feel the way we feel is that we love our modding community we think they're great uh we are constantly amazed by by the work that's put in there and we don't want to that up we don't want to make mods harder to make for the modding community and we don't want to add like extra work to them because they're already putting so much work into it we wanted to make it seamless for the mod creators as well so we're in this together you guys um so we need to figure out a solution that works for everyone uh does that mean that we'll use mod workshop or epic's version of mod whatever it's called i can't remember that they released um or if we make like an in-game version i don't know but we'll certainly we certainly care about the monarch community currently um and we certainly don't want to make it harder for them uh if anything we want to make it easier for them to make mods um so that's kind of why um why be like that with that being said mods no i'm just kidding cheaters oh we made the game in a certain way you just want to cheat it out of the way what the i can't believe you guys shame shame ugh all mods are cheap yeah oh we love you guys we love that we are we're constantly amazed by the the modding community and uh the people working on the tools that support the modding community you guys are the real mep
