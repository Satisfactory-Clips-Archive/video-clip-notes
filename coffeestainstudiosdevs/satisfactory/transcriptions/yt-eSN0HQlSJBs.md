> so yeah uh you guys have a set of ideas so yeah we've uh i can say this as well we've also worked a lot on like defining like what would satisfactory 1.0 look like like what would that contain um and that's also a big part of like why update four is taking a bit longer to define because we also like figuring that out is a much bigger task and but the nice thing about is once we've done that we can easier be like okay so update like so satisfactory 1.0 is going to be this thing like what segment of that is a good like next step um and and when defining that we can also get a better feel of like how much like how many more updates we think might be in the game but we don't know like this is the thing like pipes update three was a lot of like we didn't expect a lot of stuff to make it in when we when we released early access for satisfactory we didn't think that like we were going to have pipes we had like we had a prototype for pipes and we had ideas for pipes but we didn't actually think we were going to be implementing that so soon or like at all even um it was like on the on the drawing desk but it wasn't you know it wasn't defined fully so yeah i think that's a good summary of what's happening
