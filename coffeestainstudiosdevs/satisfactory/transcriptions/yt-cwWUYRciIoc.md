>
> call it that because uh
>
> i mean you won't necessarily see a big
>
> difference we'll see a big difference
>
> probably
>
> um but there are also some minor things
>
> that we feel like we want to probably
>
> release before update four because we
>
> really don't know the scope of update 4
>
> yet
>
> like if it's going to be a big update or
>
> a small update or
>
> like um because it also ties a bit in
>
> with like what are we doing for update 5
>
> because we also had we had a plan for
>
> update 5 for a long time
>
> which is kind of weird to say when we
>
> don't know what update 4 is but we do
>
> know what update 5
>
> is um
>
> but uh yeah we're
>
> we had a plan for update 5 and we kind
>
> of had to scrap that because
>
> of like how it was it was
>
> it was tied into like dependencies
>
> between like programmers and artists
>
> so when we were planning for update 5 we
>
> were expecting like okay but
>
> update 5 is going to be where both
>
> programmers and artists can
>
> kind of like combine forces and do a lot
>
> of work together so update four would be
>
> like more of a
>
> not a lot of like tasking for
>
> programmers because programmers wanted
>
> to work on
>
> like we we have a lot of technical depth
>
> in the in the game right now
>
> so like we need to update a bunch of
>
> systems we want to update engine
>
> um there was just a bunch of stuff like
>
> that
>
> and uh we realized that uh
>
> we can't do that we can't wait for for
>
> programming like that
>
> so so we had we had ideas on what to do
>
> with update five
>
> but we can't do that right now so but
>
> yeah
>
> this is all very vague because there are
>
> nothing set in stone yet um but
>
> i think i think like fairly soon we can
>
> start like
>
> hammering down on what update 4 is
>
> actually going to be like we're also
>
> kind of like working out how we're going
>
> to
>
> go forward this because update 3 was
>
> like you know very hush hush
>
> and we want it to be a bit more open
>
> develop like more of an open development
>
> process going forward um
>
> so we're also kind of like figuring out
>
> how we do that
>
> and if you guys have anything specific
>
> that you like that you like to see from
>
> other developers
>
> um please hit us up with like you know
>
> other things that you like i know that
>
> arc for instance does
>
> do their uh development in a certain way
>
> and like factorio is also a good
>
> inspiration for like their friday facts
>
> stuff
>
> and stuff like that so we're also
>
> looking a lot like that what you guys
>
> want to see and you know
