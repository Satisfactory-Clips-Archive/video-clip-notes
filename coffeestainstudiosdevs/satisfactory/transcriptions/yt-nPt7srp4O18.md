> but it's hard yeah like to to to plant
>
> like it's impossible to plant
>
> yeah i mean it is really difficult and
>
> we also
>
> like if we're not happy with it we're
>
> not happy with it
>
> uh if it's not good enough or if we
>
> don't think people will enjoy something
>
> that we're
>
> or we're not done yet uh specifically
>
> with like when we do new stuff
>
> uh that we haven't uh either haven't
>
> tried before
>
> or new systems then it can be really
>
> hard to estimate how much time goes in
>
> there yeah
>
> set a goal we hope we can do it
>
> sometimes we can sometimes we can
>
> because that's a big problem with games
>
> in general because like
>
> we want to be adaptive and we want to
>
> like kind of like
>
> agilely or like we want to work agile
>
> which is a
>
> common but like games tend to be very
>
> like
>
> um planned very like water flow so like
>
> we have like there's pre
>
> here's pre-production here's like
>
> production here's like delivery
>
> uh which our game doesn't really fall
>
> under i think because we're
>
> early access we're still going yeah
>
> we're still going and we're kind of like
>
> making up as we go yeah we haven't
>
> tried everything
>
> out yet that we want to potentially have
>
> in the game yeah
>
> so every time we do a new update it's
>
> like we need to do pre-production
>
> uh we need to try out every feature yeah
>
> we need to like
>
> see if they're actually if they're
>
> actually fun and and like
>
> like i don't think it's like an
>
> efficient way in in a way
>
> but at the same time it gives us all
>
> this flexibility to make what we think
>
> is the absolute best thing
>
> and then so in that way maybe it is
>
> efficient yeah uh because at the end of
>
> the day
>
> uh we have to make what's good and i'm
>
> often the kind of person that we're
>
> gonna delay i'm always like
>
> come on guys it's probably you
>
> know like i'm trying to i'm always
>
> like the oftentimes when we're
>
> discussing things
>
> i'm on your side community and i'm like
>
> come on man like
>
> they want to pull they want to play and
>
> then these guys are just like look it's
>
> going to be
>
> we can't put it out like all right all
>
> right it's gonna be we can't put
>
> out all right
>
> so like we tried we don't want to delay
>
> anything we really do it because we have
>
> to
>
> um but but it's really it's really
>
> beneficial because usually
>
> a lot of students work the way that like
>
> here's here's how much money you can
>
> spend on
>
> developing your game and like you have
>
> to fit in
>
> development during that time frame right
>
> so it's really it's really nice for us
>
> that we're not doing that without we're
>
> not saying like hey
>
> on march 19th we're releasing a game it
>
> has to be
>
> in it it needs to be in a releasable
>
> state which means like
>
> cut anything that you can't put in the
>
> game no
>
> that's some on your face we got
>
> on my face there you are
>
> oh no okay yeah but what are you saying
>
> like yeah even the early access release
>
> like when we said when we actually
>
> committed to a date was
>
> i guess comparatively a bit shorter time
>
> frame because we're actually okay now we
>
> can
>
> yeah yeah yeah that was tricky because
>
> the
>
> the options were low like picking a
>
> release date option is is tough
>
> especially when you're
>
> when you're going on a store as well
>
> like you don't want to stop on any other
>
> games release and you don't want them to
>
> stomp on you
>
> so it really is this kind of thing where
>
> it's like well they're releasing here
>
> and then there's
>
> you got a window here uh so so we had to
>
> kind of pick a date
>
> and you know we don't really work to
>
> deadlines and
>
> occasionally you have to and it's
>
> stressful
>
> and that's where the crunch comes from
>
> man it's like it's bad but
>
> it's good that we we never really get to
>
> that point where we have to have these
>
> hard deadlines like
>
> if we had up if we had to get update
>
> three here in december we'd all be
>
> insane
>
> right now yeah and it would be but
>
> it's
>
> it would not be the quality or rather it
>
> it would not
>
> contain the stuff that it's going to
>
> contain no it would we'd have to
>
> just cut stuff and you'd get it later
>
> anyway yeah so
