### Transcript

> got it
>
> um all right so so let's let's address
>
> the maybe not the the elephant
>
> in the room but uh the bauxite
>
> refinement that you brought up before
>
> so you kind of touched on this but what
>
> was the what was the issue with that
>
> and how's it going now
>
> i'm pretty happy with the box side at
>
> least like the initial rebalance i was
>
> already really happy with
>
> i didn't really have an issue either
>
> like the patch that we dropped wasn't to
>
> address
>
> the issue with the standard recipes we
>
> did do some small changes there like the
>
> the radio control unit went off being
>
> cost
>
> and because of that of course the the
>
> turbo motor also went up
>
> right and then we also increased the
>
> cost
>
> in bauxite for the heat sink which was
>
> mostly actually there to make the cost
>
> of
>
> the cooling system go up in bauxite and
>
> then also again
>
> make the turbo motor a bit more
>
> expensive um
>
> yeah i think that was kind of fun like i
>
> i'm really happy with the standard
>
> recipes right now i think the flow is
>
> good
>
> it matches the vision for the game
>
> overall and here
>
> the main issue that i was seeing was
>
> with the alternate recipes because they
>
> stack so much
>
> i think we generally made a mistake
>
> there by allowing that because the idea
>
> was that we would make bauxite a lot
>
> more uh accessible in the sense that
>
> it's not as expensive anymore in the
>
> bauxite and that was mostly because we
>
> added so many new recipes that need to
>
> use the box site so
>
> we were kind of seeing this issue of
>
> okay if we make this not way cheaper
>
> then this is just gonna bottleneck
>
> everyone on the box side all the time
>
> so we need to change it so we added more
>
> box side notes and we just generally
>
> made it a lot cheaper overall
>
> but i think we went way too far with the
>
> ultimate recipes they just stacked it
>
> crazy
>
> where you could make a turbo motor using
>
> only five
>
> box side i think per turbo motor
>
> if you use the right alts that's just a
>
> bit insane that sounds great
>
> why didn't we keep that
>
> um okay so that sounds fine by the way
>
> you guys if you didn't know or if you
>
> haven't played the game
>
> the last week or so we actually did
>
> another balancing update last week on
>
> thursday
>
> where some of these old recipes were
>
> changed did we change anything with the
>
> the regular recipes
>
> in that balance update
>
> sorry what wait where am i
>
> uh the the the update we did uh thursday
>
> last week with the balancing
>
> did we change any of the the regular
>
> recipes there
>
> uh yeah the standard ones right yeah
>
> yeah uh
>
> we changed yeah the plutonium stuff and
>
> then for the box side we changed
>
> the radio control unit and the heatsink
>
> okay cool
>
> but the uh yeah we can't we kind of like
>
> this this is
>
> the unfortunate side effect of being in
>
> early access when we're also
>
> figuring out some of these balancing
>
> changes uh where
>
> when we were in experimental we felt
>
> like the the box eye changes were
>
> necessary and they were pretty good but
>
> like mark just said some of them were a
>
> bit opie
>
> um even by arsenal there were also some
>
> old recipes that i think used uh what's
>
> it called the plutonium pellet or the
>
> the old no not plutonium yeah yeah they
>
> infused uranium
>
> yeah was it that yeah that was yeah that
>
> was just the up from my side
>
> so i tend to balance all of this in like
>
> a vacuum space especially the alts
>
> like the standard recipes they go into
>
> the
>
> into the editor pretty quickly so i can
>
> play around with them but for the
>
> alts that's just a show if i
>
> actually want to test that properly with
>
> every setup and every single combination
>
> so i'm not going to do that
>
> what i do instead is i just run the
>
> numbers in the um
>
> in the spreadsheet cool uh and try to
>
> create like interesting tradeoffs there
>
> um yeah and then i implement them
>
> and then if i make a mistake i don't
>
> realize it until it ships
>
> it's like everything with game
>
> development it's like once did we ship
>
> that all right cool
