### Transcript

> Another thing that I can tell you
> about the Alpha is that
> it will be focused on the early game
> on onboarding,
> so that's just gonna be about
> when a new player joins,
> how are they introduced to the game,
> can they figure out how to play well?
> You know, basic just early game stuff,
> but of course we'll be taking
> feedback about any bugs
> or suggestions and stuff like that as well.
> The Alpha will also be in stages,
> so what we're going to be doing is
> we're going to be focusing on
> one starting area of the game
> and seeing how that plays
> in the early game and
> we're gonna focus on that,
> making it look good
> and making it feel good
> and design the flow of the game well there.
> We're not locking out other areas of the map,
> so if you want to explore, go for it,
> but those are areas that we haven't,
> we're not saying they're final or anything like that.
> They're not polished, the gameplay
> there is maybe not perfect,
> we just want to get one
> starting area right first
> and then we'll move on to the other ones.
> The tech in the Alpha will also be limited
> so that you've only got early and
> maybe mid game stuff -
> I don't know the specifics,
> but we don't want you diving too deep
> into the late game because, again,
> we just want to test early game.
> That's the feedback we really need.
> We don't really need feedback on
> the late-game stuff now,
> that's not that we don't have it,
> but again, we just need what's
> useful to us right now.
> And also it's gonna give us an opportunity
> to keep some of the cool stuff
