> Jace: uhh
Jace: will Update 4 wipe your existing saves?
> 
> Snutt: No.
> 
> Jace: Is that a hard no, are you sure?
> 
> Snutt: Yes.
> 
> Snutt: With 90% certainty I can say that it
will not wipe existing saves.
> 
> Jace: And if he's right he gets a raise and
if not he's fired.
> 
> Snutt: You just negate all those &quot;Snutt should
