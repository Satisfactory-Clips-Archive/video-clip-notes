### Transcript

> let's keep it that way uh we're
> 
> implementing
> 
> uh covered belts reduce the amount of
> 
> objects in the world no i don't think
> 
> i don't if correct me if i'm wrong
> 
> here's snit but i'm pretty sure the
> 
> objects on
> 
> a belt don't count to the object counter
> 
> is that correct because i'm pretty sure
> 
> they use the hierarchical
> 
> instance something something
> 
> yes but they still count as like an
> 
> object because it's still calling them
> 
> uh but as like a you object because are
> 
> they the things that get counted does it
> 
> really yeah
> 
> it's the garbage collector that's like
> 
> the problem because the garbage
> 
> collector has a limit of how many
> 
> objects they can keep
> 
> track of so to speak and that's the
> 
> that's that limit
> 
> um but
> 
> i don't think i don't quite remember the
> 
> implementation of the objects on the
> 
> belts
> 
> um because i think all those are
> 
> instances and they only count as like
> 
> they're all instances that's what i'm
> 
> saying yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't
> 
> remember
> 
> i think that's why i think they're just
> 
> there might be some some data
> 
> values under like underneath the belt so
> 
> to speak that's not like the rendered
> 
> thing but what it's keeping track of
> 
> maybe but i don't think yeah there there
> 
> are there are like a
> 
> a weird array thing yeah but
> 
> the thing is so ben actually our
> 
> technical artist has actually
> 
> uh tried out doing like uh that exact
> 
> thing
> 
> like uh covered belts to see what kind
> 
> of improvement you get
> 
> from that and i don't remember if if
> 
> what the conclusion was but he has tried
> 
> it out
> 
> so i mean if it was it was beneficial
> 
> then maybe we'll see it in the future
> 
> and if it wasn't then i guess not but uh
> 
> we have gone
> 
> down that route and tried it out
