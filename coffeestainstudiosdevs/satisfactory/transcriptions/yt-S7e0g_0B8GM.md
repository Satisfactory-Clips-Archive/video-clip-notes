### Transcript

> job yeah speaking of there's more reason uh somebody asked about ray tracing before oh wow that was my segway we don't have any plans for ray tracing um the nvidia came out with i can say this though a lot of people also usually when people ask about raytracing they're also asking about dlss um i can say that uh nvidia made a plug-in for uh unreal engine that supports directx 11. that's been the main issue why we haven't like even thought about that um so it's potential that we can use that the other problem but the problem is that we're not using the supported engine version of it because they it's only supported for 426 and given how much time we spent on upgrading to 425 i don't know what our plans are for future upgrades uh because it feels like we get a little bit blocked every time we make the update and like since we have some ideas on when we want to release the game i don't know if we're gonna upgrade her again but this is my speculation i don't actually know what the plans are uh so if we do upgrade then there's potentially we could add dlss to the game uh now i say potentially because just because nvidia made a plug-in doesn't mean it's gonna work for our game uh no there's nothing like uh there's no such thing as just works uh or it's just a plug-in you put it in like yeah um but at least then we'll have the potential and then the next thing that i'll when i bring this up is also that people tend to say like what is the point of dlss uh if you don't use ray tracing and the the good thing with dlss is that you can render it on a lower uh frame rate than 10 1080 and just get better performance that way so you do get like a little bit of uh performance just by using dss so it's not like completely that we're not interested because of that so i mean it because that um because of that plug-in potentially maybe we'll see so it's it's it's not like with ray tracing up into this point we've always been like ah nah nah it won't really add anything to the game but dlss might add something to the game if we choose to do it for performance reasons uh but the other problem with that is that not all cards support lss like this it's a very small margin i think it's like three percent or something like that on steam own a graphics card or something that can't support dlss or maybe that's ray tracing but it's it's like such a small subset of people that can actually utilize it if we do implement it so that also wages into it
