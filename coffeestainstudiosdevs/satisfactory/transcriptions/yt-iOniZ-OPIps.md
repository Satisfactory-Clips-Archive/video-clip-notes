> uh what is your opinion on the most
>
> downloaded mods and is the team planning
>
> to adopt some of them since there are
>
> such a good additions
>
> uh so yeah like some of the mods
>
> most of the mods that are worked on are
>
> things that
>
> we've probably intended to have at the
>
> game at some point
>
> i don't remember what is the most
>
> downloaded mod right now i believe it's
>
> the area actions mod
>
> right uh or is it the refined power
>
> which one is the most downloaded mod
>
> right now
>
> because like there are certain mods that
>
> we're like yeah this is a good idea and
>
> this is something that we might
>
> add to the game there are certain mods
>
> that like this is a really good mod
>
> but we'll never add this to the game
>
> so like there are
>
> like the science mod for instance that's
>
> something that we're definitely going to
>
> add to the game at some point
>
> um the air actions mod i don't know if
>
> we'll actually add that
>
> every action's mod is number one it's it
>
> first of all air reaction some mod is
>
> yeah it deserves being number one it's a
>
> really good mod um
>
> i mean there are a lot of good mods
>
> honest honestly every single mod i've
>
> seen have been
>
> really good um
>
> what was it going with this yeah so like
>
> there are a bunch of mods that we see
>
> that were like this is a cool mod
>
> and this is probably something that we
>
> might do or like parts of the mod we
>
> might like
>
> add or but the mo for the most part you
>
> know we've worked on this game for
>
> so long we've like even before we
>
> announced satisfaction we worked in this
>
> game for like four years or something
>
> like that
>
> so like there's there's not an abundance
>
> of ideas on our end as well right
>
> so a lot of mods that were implemented
>
> were like things that we thought like
>
> maybe we'll add this to the game and
>
> then a mod was created for it and we're
>
> like
>
> huh looks like we're on the right track
>
> huh
>
> fellas um and that's been the case for a
>
> lot of times
>
> uh the on when i talk to our game
>
> director and our producer
>
> they've said that there aren't many mods
>
> that like they haven't thought of before
>
> but they're really happy that they exist
>
> obviously
>
> and and like we'll see in the future
>
> what the future will bring
>
> what kind of mods we will
>
> implement ourselves
>
> but you know even if we don't
>
> necessarily like take inspiration
>
> like if if okay so even if there are
>
> mods that like this is a cool mod
>
> we already thought of it you know the
>
> implementation of the mod
>
> can you know really help us sometimes
>
> we'll like we'll see the implementation
>
> they've done and be like
>
> i like that aspect but i don't like that
>
> aspect of it um
>
> so like i believe hypertubes is kind of
>
> like a
>
> a product of what i just mentioned where
>
> like we saw like some of the mods like
>
> the elevator mod and the uh
>
> one other like teleport mod or something
>
> which we also tried doing but we didn't
>
> like it
>
> we saw that and like there are issues
>
> with that mod but we like
>
> the sentiment of the mod what can we
>
> make out of that and then
>
> i don't think that's necessarily how
>
> hypertubes were born but that's
>
> like a you know that that's kind of how
>
> some of the mods have affected us so you
>
> know
>
> the mods really help us uh even if it's
>
> stuff that we
>
> don't plan to implement or if it's stuff
>
> that we do plan to implement it kind of
>
> helps us
>
> you know verify stuff that we
>
> hypothesize about
>
> some things we already tried and we
>
> already know that you know
>
> this isn't something that we like but if
>
> people dig it as a mod then that's dope
>
> then just
>
> download that for a long time people
>
> were like asking us like do you endorse
>
> monster you like mods like
>
> yeah duh like the mods are so
>
> cool
>
> uh and we've always had mods like
>
> like the game has been implemented the
>
> way it has because we want to support
>
> mods
>
> this the way our save system works is
>
> like
>
> it's a pain in the ass to work with but
>
> it's it's been developed that way
>
> so that we can support mods and like to
>
> save editor and stuff like that
>
> so yeah long long story short we love
>
> mods and
>
> some some ideas for mods are stuff that
>
> we are intending to implement
>
> some ideas for mods are stuff that we
>
> might implement but we don't know yet
>
> some ideas are stuff that we feel this
>
> is an awesome mod by itself
>
> but not necessarily something that we'd
>
> add to the game
>
