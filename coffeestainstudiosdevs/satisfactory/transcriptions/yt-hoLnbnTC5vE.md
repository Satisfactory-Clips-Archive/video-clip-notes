### Transcript

> um do you think we'll rework radar
>
> towers
>
> in what sense like are we happy because
>
> that's a pretty good point too are we
>
> happy with the the way
>
> the map works in the game with like the
>
> exploration aspects of it
>
> i think we could do a lot more with it
>
> uh also the radar tower if you think
>
> from a purely
>
> gameplay perspective then i think there
>
> could be more benefits to having it
>
> uh and the map has always been the
>
> suspension point of like we kind of
>
> wanted in the mam but
>
> then you also as a new player you don't
>
> even know that it's there
>
> uh how do you know where to get the map
>
> maybe it's just something that we should
>
> give by default or it should be way
>
> clearer that you can get it in that
>
> quartz research somehow
>
> uh there's different things there but
>
> yeah i want to do more with the map in
>
> general as well
>
> wait do you not get the map from from
>
> the map right now
>
> yeah you do yeah okay i was like oh yeah
>
> yeah yeah you get in the quartz research
>
> pretty pretty easily but
>
> the problem is that generally you don't
>
> know that it's there you have to know
>
> yeah i've seen a bunch of people are
>
> like hey why do i not have the map yet
>
> and it's like because you haven't
>
> researched it
>
> that's true yeah maybe that's one of
>
> those things you don't want to put
>
> behind a progression wall like that
>
> where yeah
>
> uh raider towers have no use uh
>
> i guess they help you like what do they
>
> actually do
>
> i've never used onex they reveal parts
>
> of the map yeah that's it right
>
> yeah because we have to think they could
>
> do more yeah we have talked about like
>
> maybe
>
> being able to like scout on the map
>
> stuff
>
> because you have the like an upgrade to
>
> your uh
>
> object scanner
>
> because right now the obvious scanner is
>
> just like it just looks so the closest
>
> one in proximity whereas the radar tower
>
> could be more like
>
> in this area you can find
>
> that's pretty cool though like you get
>
> an area of effect on the map
>
> where an object is i was also thinking
>
> it could just constantly show you what
>
> resources are within its radius so you
>
> don't have to constantly scan for them
>
> to see them
>
> that kind of becomes an issue of course
>
> with the compass but i think we can
>
> figure something out for that
>
> yeah that would already make it more
>
> practical another suggestion i think
>
> that burke gave me a while back was that
>
> if we do the logic system or the circuit
>
> system however you want to call it
>
> that could be a really cool use as well
>
> for the raider tower to potentially send
>
> data from those kind of systems over
>
> longer distances to other parts of the
>
> factory
>
> right so there is some more potential
>
> for them i think both with the map
>
> and other features that we might want to
>
> add
