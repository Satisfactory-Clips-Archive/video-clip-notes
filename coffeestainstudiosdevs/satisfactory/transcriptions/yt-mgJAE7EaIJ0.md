>

> 
> that's all well and good but the qa site

> 
> um help draw our attention into certain

>

> 
> directly give you know answer questions
>

>

> 
> the community can see it
> 
> uh people within the office can see it
> 
> we can interact directly um
> 
> so trying to do that from in the game is
> 
> like really
> 
> really hard i don't want to say
> 
> impossible it's not impossible but
> 
> it would be really hard for us to try
>

> 
> so that you didn't have to leave the
> 
> game to do it um and
> 
> that's one of those things that i don't
> 
> think we're going to be choosing to do
> 
> that over
> 
> adding a new feature or optimization or
> 
> fixed bugs yeah
> 
> we'd rather may also maintain like one
> 
> feedback
> 
> place rather than maintain it in the
> 
> game as well because we did that before
> 
> we had like two places
> 
> to maintain that and it wasn't optimal
