> will there be ever be a belt that goes even faster like a mark six one maybe potentially uh potentially but there's currently a problem with the game where there's some precision issues with the the way calculations are made in the logic for bells so we're we haven't added mark 6 belts just because um you you ha you get problems um what's the whole story here i'm trying to remember what we said about this uh yeah this is already a problem that exists in the game like the belts aren't deterministic right now and so that means that you know if you if you have a low frame rate you can run into issues where where you should have like you know 100 efficiency you may not get 100 efficiency um it's related to to uh you know the amount of calculations that are done every single frame same issue on pipes same thing there um 200 votes nice sort of like to see nice we just need 800 more um what was i talking about yeah so we'd need to solve that issue before we can add faster belts um or what we can do also is is lower the speed of some of the other buildings to make it match up to whatever the highest speed is currently because i know that if you overclock like miners you won't be able to get the the full efficiency out of them
