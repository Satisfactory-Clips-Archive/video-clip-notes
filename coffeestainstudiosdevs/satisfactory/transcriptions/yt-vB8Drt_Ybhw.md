>
> i don't think we're ever gonna add that
>
> to be honest maybe we'll do like you can
>
> lay down in the hub or something but
>
> the the biggest gripe we have with
>
> sleeping in the hub
>
> is the fact that all the stuff inside a
>
> factory is like
>
> depending on time
>
> all right i don't know if you guys heard
>
> that my neighbor is screwing around
>
> um we don't want we can't really add
>
> like fast forwarding stuff like that to
>
> the game
>
> because of a few reasons the main one
>
> being that you would speed up your
>
> factories
>
> and that would we don't like that for
>
> two reasons
>
> one is because you would be able to like
>
> quote unquote cheat
>
> you know speed up your time and be able
>
> to get around that
>
> uh it also messes with
>
> the like it kind of optimizes away the
>
> fun of automation in a sense because
>
> it can lead to a lot of cases where
>
> people
>
> don't auto like don't learn automation
>
> just because they can sleep
>
> uh throughout time and just like make
>
> small things and don't expand their
>
> builds and stuff like that
>
> we already have that problem a little
>
> bit with the workbench in early game
>
> where
>
> if you don't realize that you should
>
> automate you can just go back to the
>
> workbench over and over and keep
>
> uh manually grafting and that's that's
>
> an issue we've had since day one it's an
>
> issue we don't really have a solution
>
> for and we don't want to introduce
>
> something else that adds on top of that
>
> uh the second thing is that um
>
> we it's a technical thing as well with
>
> speeding up the game because if we do we
>
> can't like
>
> it's it's it's a really tr tough problem
>
> to solve
>
> if we were to say like all right it's
>
> now 1 pm
>
> i wanna i want to load the game at 6 pm
>
> because we need to simulate everything
>
> that goes on
>
> in between that time and
>
> depending on your base that can be very
>
> very
>
> very expensive so what can happen is
>
> you go to bed and then the game crash
>
> like
>
> it seems like the game is crashing
>
> because it needs to simulate
>
> and that's a problem we just like don't
>
> want to focus on right now so we we're
>
> probably not going to introduce sleeping
>
> in the hub
>
> i know that it's frustrating that we do
>
> have like the mattresses there
>
> but maybe we'll we'll do something else
>
> with those in the future or something
>
> just so they make sense or maybe we'll
>
> just remove them
>
> but i don't think we're going to do that
>
> i think we're going to do something else
>
> with them that's a little bit more fun
>
> um yeah just just do like a sleeping

> animation but you don't actually go to
>
> bed or something like that
