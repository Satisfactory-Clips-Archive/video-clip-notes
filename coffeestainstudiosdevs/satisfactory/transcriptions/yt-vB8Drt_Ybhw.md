### Transcript

> uh can we just finally sleep in the hub i don't think we're ever gonna add that to be honest maybe we'll do like you can lay down in the hub or something but the the biggest gripe we have with sleeping in the hub is the fact that all the stuff inside a factory is like depending on time all right i don't know if you guys heard that my neighbor is screwing around um we don't want we can't really add like fast forwarding stuff like that to the game because of a few reasons the main one being that you would speed up your factories and that would we don't like that for two reasons one is because you would be able to like quote unquote cheat you know speed up your time and be able to get around that uh it also messes with the like it kind of optimizes away the fun of automation in a sense because it can lead to a lot of cases where people don't auto like don't learn automation just because they can sleep uh throughout time and just like make small things and don't expand their builds and stuff like that we already have that problem a little bit with the workbench in early game where if you don't realize that you should automate you can just go back to the workbench over and over and keep uh manually grafting and that's that's an issue we've had since day one it's an issue we don't really have a solution for and we don't want to introduce something else that adds on top of that uh the second thing is that um we it's a technical thing as well with speeding up the game because if we do we can't like it's it's it's a really tr tough problem to solve if we were to say like all right it's now 1 pm i wanna i want to load the game at 6 pm because we need to simulate everything that goes on in between that time and depending on your base that can be very very very expensive so what can happen is you go to bed and then the game crash like it seems like the game is crashing because it needs to simulate and that's a problem we just like don't want to focus on right now so we we're probably not going to introduce sleeping in the hub i know that it's frustrating that we do have like the mattresses there but maybe we'll we'll do something else with those in the future or something just so they make sense or maybe we'll just remove them but i don't think we're going to do that i think we're going to do something else with them that's a little bit more fun um yeah just just do like a sleeping animation but you don't actually go to bed or something like that
