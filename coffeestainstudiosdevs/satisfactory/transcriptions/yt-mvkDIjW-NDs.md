> always
> 
> point out when you do the the press
> 
> stuff jase is like when
> 
> when you start building uh upwards
> 
> like the top down view kind of also
> 
> doesn't really work for that yeah yeah
> 
> yeah so like some people have just asked
> 
> for a top-down view
> 
> it's just not a good idea at all um
> 
> because because this is this has a third
> 
> dimension and you can build up and you
> 
> can have multi layers
> 
> then you can't really the top-down view

> hard to know if an idea is good idea is
> 
> good if not
> 
> until you try it so for instance like a
> 
> lot of people ask her about the
> 
> procedure generation stuff
> 
> and fun fact we did have procedural
> 
> generation
> 
> at one point and skipped it because we
> 
> didn't feel like it
> 
> added enough to the game or whatever i'm
> 
> not sure i wasn't around at the time
> 
> yeah yeah that was basically the game it
> 
> was the case
> 
> yeah i mean when you look at this world
> 
> now i i went like when you see it's like
> 
> fully
> 
> handcrafted uh you can see the trade off
> 
> it's it's
> 
> uh easy to see yeah
