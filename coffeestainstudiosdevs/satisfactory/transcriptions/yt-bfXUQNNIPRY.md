> um multiplayer how's it going when came better sync and multiplayer well multiplayer is going to get a little bit better every update you guys because we we make we we chip away at it uh all the time um so even with the engine upgrade there should have been uh some improvements there and there's also a few systems coming in in update four that will hopefully also improve uh performance on online play so well essentially most patches will have some slight improvement but it's it's a marathon as jase likes to put it it's yup yeah you're going to see improvements incrementally rather than just like a big one yeah fixing the multiplayer is not one thing that you do it's not like well oh well we'll fix the multiplayer this week that's not how it works yeah it's we fix the multiplayer always and uh eventually it will be it's one of those things that if you if you compare the multiplayer now to six months ago you will you really see the difference oh yeah and then a year ago you really see the difference but from day to day you won't see much of a difference and i played an old build of the game recently and uh it is everything is just way better like god damn like i can't believe it was playable back in back in back in the day
