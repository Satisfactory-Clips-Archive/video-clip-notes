>
> a reality
>
> a possibility but we'll see when we get
>
> closer and we'd also
>
> work with the current modding community
>
> to figure out what works best for them
>
> as well because
>
> there's there's a like there's different
>
> parties here right there's both like the
>
> people that want to install mods
>
> there's our from our aspect how we want
>
> to handle it and then the modern
>
> community
>

>
>  on the modern community and be like
>
> yeah they spend so much time working on
>
> the mods right now and then be like
>
> all right now you have to change
>
> completely how you upload mods
>
> like we don't want to do that we want to
>
> work together with them
>
> yeah exactly and it's like
>
> uh you know i know like workshop
>
> workshop is pretty
>
> easy to use but even if you look at the
>
> modding community there are a few
>
> unofficial modding communities
>
> tools and repository and everything it's
>
> insanely easy to use
>
> yeah it's just an app you just launch
>
> the game with a different application
>
> and that's it you can get any mod you
