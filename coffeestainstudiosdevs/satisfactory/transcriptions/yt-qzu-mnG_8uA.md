>
> yeah they spend so much time working on

> all right now you have to change
>
> completely how you upload mods
>
> like we don't want to do that we want to
>
> work together with them
>
> yeah exactly and it's like
>
> uh you know i know like workshop
>
> workshop is pretty
>
> easy to use but even if you look at the
>
> modding community there are a few
>
> unofficial modding communities
>
> tools and repository and everything it's
>
> insanely easy to use
>
> yeah it's just an app you just launch
>
> the game with a different application
>
> and that's it you can get any mod you
