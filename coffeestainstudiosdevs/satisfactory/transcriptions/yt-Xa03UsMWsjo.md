### Transcript

> power um multiple body slots when
>
> yes maybe maybe
>
> uh yeah we've talked about a lot of
>
> different solutions and you've talked
>
> about this a bunch
>
> on here as well generally we do want to
>
> support it it's just uh
>
> the problem before for me has always
>
> been that we don't have enough different
>
> types of equipments
>
> which kind of makes a lot of challenges
>
> that we can apply with exploration
>
> super redundant because we don't have
>
> the tools to then challenge the player
>
> anymore
>
> right when they have a jet pack and a
>
> gas mask and the blade runners but i
>
> don't think the general idea of having
>
> those things on at the same time is an
>
> issue
>
> so i think we want to support it if that
>
> is from multiple body slots or maybe
>
> combining equipment together at certain
>
> points in the game so we can
>
> maybe control it a bit better that way
>
> as well i don't really know yet
>
> we have been talking about it a lot
>
> there's a lot of different ways on how
>
> to do this
>
> but it kind of comes down for me at
>
> least to the idea that we need more
>
> types of equipments
>
> so that you can actually have different
>
> things in your head slot if you could
>
> only have the gas mask there it would be
>
> a bit meh
>
> so i want more different types of
>
> equipments to really make this
>
> a proper thing and then of course more
>
> things that actually require you to have
>
> those equipments and want to use them
>
> and swap around sometimes not constantly
>
> run around with the same stuff on your
>
> body
>
> gotcha one other thing that you pointed
>
> out before as well that was pretty
>
> interesting i haven't thought about it
>
> was that the world is kind of designed
>
> around the fact that you have
>
> one body slot that you use at the same
>
> time so like when you're in gas
>
> you won't need the jump uh the jet pack
>
> to be able to like
>
> get around the the world puzzles that we
>
> have in those locations and i guess the
>
> world
>
> does will need some redesign
>
> if we're gonna have more than one body
>
> slot for those cases
>
> yeah that's a big problem like you said
>
> like you could have a jump also that has
>
> gas on it specifically to stop you from
>
> using the jet jetpack to get onto it
>
> or make you think in a more creative way
>
> of how you can
>
> either build your way up or get to get
>
> there with the jetpack from like a
>
> different point
>
> but that would kind of be ruined of
>
> course if you can have them both at the
>
> same time than the whole gym person just
>
> gets
>
> completely destroyed right
