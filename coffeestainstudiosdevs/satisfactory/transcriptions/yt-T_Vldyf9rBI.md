> nice working game game struggles with 10
>
> tractors 14 trucks
>
> one explorer 83 factory cars oh
>
> really huh good information i would have
>
> never
>
> guessed that that would have been an
>
> issue oh yeah the
>
> vehicles are huge we're not
>
> running apparently we're not running uh
>
> like uh when
>
> when vehicles aren't
>
> um they're not close to you like when
>
> we're doing approximation we're still
>
> doing
>
> the wheel simulation on them i think
>
> there was an issue i don't know if that
>
> broke with an
>
> engine update i vaguely remember yeah
>
> maybe that's right because i know that
>
> stack fixed that once yeah
>
> and then ben did like uh off my say or

>
> we got
>
> and he found that like holy it's
>
> running so many simulations still even
>
> though
>
> there's only one like one factor card
>
> close to you
>
> so yeah vehicles the vehicles have
>
> always been known to be uh
>
> not optimists or not like not often like
>
> they're pretty expensive in general
>
> it's a pretty yeah we were
>
> legit at the beginning of development we
>
> were talking about like
>
> you can max have four vehicles in a safe
>
> uh and suck it
>
> like that's interesting yeah
>
> and then we never got around to doing
>
> implementing that and then
>
> yeah seeing this history
