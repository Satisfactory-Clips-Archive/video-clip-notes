> so yeah so the mug is coming anyway
> 
> let's get back to the uh the plans yeah
> 
> what are we talking about that was a
> 
> pretty good one i forgot to add that
> 
> actually
> 
> so yeah so next week we have
> 
> a potential um if you remember last year
> 
> we were talking about having
> 
> um we are updating updating the engine
> 
> version of the game
> 
> um where you for those who don't know
> 
> we're using unreal engine to make the
> 
> game
> 
> and uh the game is that's out right now
> 
> is using the engine version 4.22
> 
> and the latest version right now is 426
> 
> uh but we've updated the game to 425
> 
> it's a huge process uh because we've
> 
> made a lot of
> 
> alterations to the engine to be able to
> 
> make this game
> 
> and every time we update
> 
> the game like you update the engine
> 
> version uh to the game
> 
> which uh the reason why we're doing that
> 
> is because we get a bunch of like
> 
> optimization features from the engine
> 
> we get some tools that we can use to
> 
> like keep working on the game
> 
> stuff like that so it's very beneficial
> 
> for everyone to do it um
> 
> but every time we do it it kind of like
> 
> always causes like a lot of issues like
> 
> a lot of weird bugs that
> 
> previously worked because of like um
> 
> like if if unreal and if epic like
> 
> change the way rendering
> 
> works for like certain material types
> 
> then we have to
> 
> update to accommodate for that if you
> 
> watch the stream with dylan one of our
> 
> programmers like
> 
> a few months ago i think it was in
> 
> november uh he streamed
> 
> working on upgrading the game uh he was
> 
> just making like the
> 
> the conveyor belts render again like
> 
> they stopped rendering in the newsletter
> 
> so this is just a bunch of work uh and
> 
> we're planning to put that out on
> 
> experimental
> 
> next week uh we wanted to put it out
> 
> last year
> 
> but unfortunately it got a bit delayed
> 
> because
> 
> there was just a lot of weird
> 
> happening when we were upgrading the
> 
> engine and we didn't get it to like a
> 
> good state of release until like last
> 
> week and then
> 
> from our point of view like it didn't
> 
> make sense to put it out on experimental
> 
> if it's going to be really really buggy
> 
> and we don't know and we can't fix it
> 
> so we opted to just not release it uh
> 
> last year
> 
> over the the holiday period yeah because
> 
> if it breaks we can't do anything
> 
> but something i need to be super clear
> 
> on is the the it releasing next week
> 
> is um it's still a big maybe they're
> 
> still we're still testing some stuff
> 
> here so
> 
> uh you know like we're we're saying that
> 
> just to keep you
> 
> up to date but i uh we we're if we need
> 
> to push it back
> 
> even more then we're gonna do that we
> 
> need to make sure that we don't pressure
> 
> the team too much to
> 
> to force something out before it's ready
> 
> uh and this is a big thing so uh
> 
> i shared just before the link here
> 
> engine upgrade information video that i
> 
> made last year and that's about this
> 
> upgrade that's going to come either next
> 
> week or
> 
> so after that pretty
> 
> and one also one big thing to point out
> 
> is that if you
> 
> this patch will be very experimental
> 
> like it's gonna be way more experimental
> 
> than
> 
> previously potentially it's gonna be way
> 
> like a few things
> 
> will get way better potentially um
> 
> but potentially there's going to be a
> 
> lot of issues too so
> 
> if you're one of those people that you
> 
> know
> 
> really don't want to play on like you
> 
> know
> 
> a broken version of the game um just to
> 
> see like what new features exist
> 
> uh make sure to like back up your saves
> 
> first of all because the saves
> 
> are not cloud synced on the experimental
> 
> version i believe
> 
> um or if they are then they will
> 
> mismatch between the early access
> 
> version
> 
> so if you switch back and forth oh this
> 
> is unepic if you switch back and forth
> 
> you might get some some weird uh
> 
> save file mismatch thing that can be
> 
> confusing
> 
> so make sure the back of your saves no
> 
> matter what um
> 
> and know that the experimental version
> 
> that's gonna come out on experimental is
> 
> gonna be actually
> 
> experimental so um
> 
> yeah just just putting that out there so
> 
> people
> 
> put it out there no and um
> 
> i think that's everything i had to say
> 
> about that at least
> 
> and do you have anything else to add
> 
> jace uh
> 
> someone was saying that we're i'm we're
> 
> only saying this because
> 
> you know to shut people up because
> 
> they're they keep saying you know
> 
> where's the engine upgrade but the thing
> 
> is no one's asking for that
> 
> we're telling you we're telling you
> 
> because we have new information we want
> 
> to keep you in the loop
> 
> yes uh but the engine upgrade will
> 
> potentially be pretty awesome because
> 
> it will potentially fix some of the lag
> 
> issues that people are having
> 
> with players specifically the one where
> 
> uh players and maybe vehicles also when
> 
> they like lag around
> 
> and like don't update properly there's
> 
> been some
> 
> improvement there um potential
> 
> improvement at least
> 
> and some like network optimization as
> 
> well in general
> 
> specifically on that branch and there's
> 
> gonna be more
> 
> improvements coming too that i don't
> 
> know if it's gonna make it into the
> 
> coming engine upgrade but there's like
> 
> more stuff coming too we've worked on
> 
> like an optimization pass
> 
> on network in general too
> 
> um so like
> 
> some potential good stuff happening like
> 
> this 2021 might be a good year after all
> 
> you know
> 
> it can't possibly get worse hey i sure
> 
> can actually
> 
> i say that because
> 
> oh yeah indeed um um
> 
> let's see when's unrelenting five and
> 
> run
> 
> on religion five please you know it's a
> 
> weird thing uh
> 
> it's it's kind of a weird thing to ask
> 
> for uh to have under dungeon five
> 
> because
> 
> you know we can upgrade it's unreal
> 
> engine five when it actually makes sense
> 
> uh for us to do so but it's not like if
> 
> we upgrade it
> 
> things are gonna be better we need we
> 
> need to look and see
> 
> like what we're going to what's going to
> 
> be better what's going to break what's
> 
> not going to break
> 
> how much time is it going to take uh
> 
> simply wanting 105 is
> 
> is i think a bit silly it's not it's not
> 
> something that's going to automatically
> 
> give
> 
> free wins to anything something we have
> 
> to carefully uh
> 
> take into account so um so i don't know
> 
> when unreal engine 5 is going to be
> 
> uh it will be when it makes sense when
> 
> our program is
> 
> deemed to to make sense make it worth
> 
> the time yeah
> 
> another kind of related thing is a lot
> 
> of people ask me about
> 
> um like ray tracing and dlss and stuff
> 
> like that for satisfactory
> 
> and that's also something that like
> 
> we're not super interested and added
> 
> that
> 
> um it's it's cool and and all and like
> 
> potentially
> 
> we could do it but currently we can't
> 
> because where you the game is is made
> 
> for directx
> 
> 11 currently and uh you need to go up to
> 
> directx 12
> 
> to even to be able to support that at
> 
> all and that's something that
> 
> we kind of have done a little bit work
> 
> on
> 
> um but it's not like we're not it's
> 
> possible
> 
> it's like it's like a side thing we've
> 
> been working on it's not like something
> 
> that we've fully committed on
> 
> so it's gonna be optional actually in in
> 
> the engine upgrade version that's coming
> 
> up that you can actually
> 
> switch it to unreal to directx 12. but
> 
> that's going to be experimental even
> 
> more experimental than the actual like
> 
> super experiment super hyper duper
> 
> experiment
> 
> [Music]
> 
> another reason not to super go too hard
> 
> into like again people want
> 
> ray tracing uh we we sort of do have to
> 
> always think about like well what
> 
> how much time would that take to put
> 
> into the game and
> 
> how will the game progress in terms of
> 
> its development um
> 
> being an early x's game it's not always
> 
> just about making the game cool we have
> 
> to sort of move towards a finished game
> 
> and i don't think it actually does move
> 
> us towards the finished game
> 
> like i yeah that's just kind of
> 
> what i think at least it's not something
> 
> that we need to focus too much on about
> 
> right now like they're like
> 
> like what about new new content that
> 
> needs to come in what about the story
> 
> you know what about um finalized
> 
> balancing you know
> 
> what about um other big features that we
> 
> want to get into the game
> 
> do we want to add more what about
> 
> dedicated servers what about
> 
> uh do we want to add more vehicles or
> 
> more changes to vehicles
> 
> all these things are things that we
> 
> could sync our time into or we could
> 
> make some people's game
> 
> maybe look better and even fewer still
> 
> that
> 
> that won't be losing frames for it yeah
> 
> uh it's it's seriously like not a good
> 
> uh rushing it's not a good uh way to
> 
> spend our time at all yeah so maybe like
> 
> in the future when we feel like you know
> 
> when we reach 1.0 and we want to add
> 
> like you know
> 
> yeah on top of like make the cake look
> 
> better you know maybe then we'll do
> 
> something about that
> 
> um but right now it's not really a
> 
> priority for us
> 
> yeah yeah
