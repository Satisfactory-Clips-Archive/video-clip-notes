> will you be adding more variety of resources um i don't think so i'm not sure this is a good question for our game director but i believe no i believe the way we would extend the game right now at this point is to kind of explore what you can build with the current research chains um i believe but i'm not 100 sure on that actually and it's not like impossible that we won't because adding water like adding pipes meant that we added more liquids as well so like i mean that's kind of a resource but you are collecting it for water or oil and stuff like that um so i don't think we will add more resources uh the mam is also not utilized yet but the mam is for story related stuff um that that is also like a bunch of resources gonna be collected from that so yeah
