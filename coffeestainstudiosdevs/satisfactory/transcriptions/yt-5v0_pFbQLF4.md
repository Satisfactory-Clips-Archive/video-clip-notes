> like the world branch
>
> where people are working on like the
>
> level and then we have our development

>
> in updates and at some point we're going
>
> to like squeeze in the world branch into
>
> the update branch it's going to be a
>

>
> doing updates to the world over and over
>
> again there's going to be more and more
>
> cases where people's like factories
>
> would be buried under
>
> like mountains and stuff like that so

> maybe we can showcase some some of it uh
>
> at a later stream uh when we were more
>

>
