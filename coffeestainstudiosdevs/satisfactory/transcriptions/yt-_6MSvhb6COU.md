>
> hover pack versus jetpack
>
> at this point i mean they're they are
>
> super different
>

>
> to make it easier for you to
>
> go get around your um factory
>
> course the jet pack doesn't directly
>
> help you with building but it helps you
>
> getting potentially up onto a refinery
>
> or getting from one part of the factory
>
> to another
>
> and that can help you get an overview of
>
> your factory right
>
> getting up on those high places moving
>
> around more quickly more practically
>
> uh in the same sense that in a way the
>
> the blade runners also help you with
>
> building because you can instantly jump
>
> onto a splitter which gives you a slight
>
> elevation
>
> which makes it a lot easier to build
>
> belts between your factories from there

> i i had the hover pack
>
> i i had no cost on so i wasn't paying
>
> for anything so i was just building
>
> power
>
> building powerpoint power power poles
>
> you just keep flying everywhere
>
> yeah i mean you can do it it's that's
>
> why it's not that fast we kind of wanted
>
> to limit that
>
> that use case uh although some players
>
> have been suggesting maybe to use
>
> batteries then i can fly around
>
> everywhere i don't really want to
>
> support that but i think if it's not
>
> that fast and if
>
> that maybe is an upgrade if we move it
>
> to like earlier unlock and then we do an
>
> mk2 over pack it uses batteries and
>
> there's a lot of options there gotcha
>
> cool
