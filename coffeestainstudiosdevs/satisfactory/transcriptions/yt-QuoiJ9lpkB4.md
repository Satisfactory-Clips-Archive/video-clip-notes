### Transcript

> are we straight huh any chance of oh uh dxr implementation eventually new hdx cards getting announced in a few minutes and it would be great if all the extra horsepower can make lights feasible um it's kind of hard to say uh i don't think so personally um we have talked about this in the past we would rather you know spend that performance on other things to be honest to be fully honest we'd rather spend that on other things you know lights would be cool uh but rtx cards like it would suck if it's like yeah you have you can get lights but there will only be support on rtx cars like that's not how i want to do things the same goes for ray tracing like we we can't make the game so that like just a handful of people or like people with certain hardware can play like we won't like to make the game as accessible to everyone as possible like those type of things are more like you know optional things like if you have the car to drive it then sure i don't see how we could possibly implement that and have time for everything else because there's so much else you want to implement um but that's that's my guess and i mean i've been thwarted before but you know we've we've when we've talked about it we've always been like nah it's not happening dlss only perhaps same thing like i don't know uh when we've talked about it we've always kind of like i don't think it's gonna happen bro like all the programmers when we talk about it just because there's so much else work to do and there are other there are so many other areas we'd rather optimize and make performance rather than implement something that's extra performant you know um if unreal engine makes it really easy well that's the thing it never is really easy like there you can wish that it was like it never works out of the box unfortunately those kind of stuff
