### Transcript

> what is the limit it's kind of hard to
>
> say what the limit is because
>
> uh a lot of people confuse the limit
>
> with like object limits like
>
> in-game object limits which is not what
>
> is it what
>
> that is it's tied into the data
>
> objects data objects which isn't like
>
> one constructor are more data objects
>
> than a foundation for instance
>
> yes and no that's it's the primitive
>
> stuff too
>
> so we're trying to so it's pretty much
>
> i mean it's technically possible to say
>
> exactly what the limit is
>
> but it it really depends how you build
>
> because i've loaded
>
> save files that have that are
>
> less complex than all than say false
>
> that have hit the limit so to speak
>
> uh and it's mostly things that we are
>
> need to optimize for
>
> um because there are cases sometimes
>
> where like we just didn't think of like
>
> oh this is using a lot of stuff
>
> yeah we i think with the train update we
>
> had one issue where there's
>
> it was a simple thing of uh particle
>
> systems weren't being destroyed
>
> yeah so every time it took a turn it was
>
> scraping and that was just a miss
>
> like and i think it was just in
>
> blueprint even so it wasn't even yeah so
>
> yeah you find those things out too late
>
> after people with like big saves
>
> have trains running everywhere and then
>
> you're like why are they hitting the
>
> limit they shouldn't be hitting the
>
> limit
>
> then you could even see it as like
>
> people were playing it the game would
>
> slow down oh
>
> the fps was like chugging you're like
>
> why is this happening yeah take like 20
>
> minutes then the game was at a
>
> standstill
>
> there's also cases where uh if you like
>
> looked at a lot of or if you open a lot
>
> of storage containers you would also hit
>
> that limit sooner
>
> stuff like that yeah
