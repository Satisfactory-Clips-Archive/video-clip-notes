### Transcript

> Combat will be.. it's not a super big part.. but it is a part
> and you can't really avoid it, cause when you go out and explore,
> especially when you find new resources,
> sometimes there will be nests of enemies,
> and they live like on top of the resource you want.
> So you have to get rid of them to be able to get the resources.
> But also as you are exploring for other stuff,
> they're gonna be around in the environment.
> It's gonna be impossible to play the game without having to fight enemies.
