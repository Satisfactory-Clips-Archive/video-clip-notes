> yeah i really don't co-op network has been fixed yes uh so like this it will probably not be fully fixed until like 1.0 but like it'll get better uh it's one of those things where like jace talked about this in the qa video that we posted actually let me drop that qa video actually actually actually oh my god so the thing about networking fixes is that there's no like one thing that fixes all the issues um it's like gradual process uh and we are working on it all the time like we have people dedicated doing nothing but fixing network stuff and some stu some networking fixes are fairly simple to do and some are like we have to remake like a whole system for it to work essentially uh and uh right now we're working on so i'm gonna drop the keyway there uh right now we're redoing how conveyor belts handle um network play because when you're playing online sometimes the conveyables would get into a weird state and you can even get like a disconnect because of the conveyor belts so we're working on that right now and then we're also working on a player lag like when you're running around movement stuff so it doesn't um like desync as much but it's it's like it's a big topic like all all network play in general are huge systems and you know in games like call of duty where they have like you know movement and then there's the whole shooting mechanic like they have a few systems where we have so many big systems that are all chunked into one game and we can't really like have the same quality as other games for every single system we have to like get as much in as possible so we're right now we're working mostly on like getting you know uh replication be as proficient as possible and and those like desync issues will gradually disappear so it will get better don't worry about it or like it's gonna i hopefully it's gonna be in a really good state at some point there's probably gonna be a limit to it as well but you know it's a gradual process it's gone um it's going it's going
