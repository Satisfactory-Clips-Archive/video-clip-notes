> now we'll find out in the future uh in
> 
> the future will
> 
> will there be better movement or ways to
> 
> equip multiple movement items when you
> 
> go to the end game movement feels slow
> 
> due to the amount of distance that needs
> 
> to travel
> 
> uh yeah maybe i don't know so
> 
> there's there's a bit of a technical
> 
> aspect to this
> 
> um one common problem with games
> 
> is streaming levels right um
> 
> and uh like one nice thing about
> 
> releasing on console is that you know
> 
> exactly what hardware you're releasing
> 
> on so you know exactly how long it takes
> 
> when you're streaming in levels how long
> 
> it will take for the levels to load
> 
> uh whereas we don't really have that on
> 
> pc so one thing
> 
> that game developers do you're getting
> 
> really
> 
> yeah sure you can do whatever you want
> 
> jason yeah dude go for it man
> 
> i mean the space efficient isn't it
> 
> um so so one common thing that game
> 
> developers do is that they slow down
> 
> movement speed so that it will take
> 
> longer to traverse
> 
> the tiles that you're streaming in right
> 
> and uh
> 
> we don't really have the luxury of be
> 
> able to do that we actually
> 
> i remember one discussion we had with
> 
> epic about
> 
> like our vehicles and stuff they were
> 
> like
> 
> yeah but maybe you should slow down the
> 
> movement speed and we're like we can't
> 
> slow down the movement speed right
> 
> like that would that would feel weird uh
> 
> but then we're having these like
> 
> streaming issues that we're having right
> 
> now so
> 
> can't win them all um
> 
> so yeah movement speed is is a bit iffy
> 
> i'll i'll be it like moving make
> 
> everything
> 
> 001 but that movement speed is a bit
> 
> different so yeah maybe maybe we'll add
> 
> like some of like a johnny
> 
> running like jetpack thing or something
> 
> speed booster
> 
> i don't know chuck that on the question
> 
> side and make make your voice heard
> 
> you get a vote gotta vote
