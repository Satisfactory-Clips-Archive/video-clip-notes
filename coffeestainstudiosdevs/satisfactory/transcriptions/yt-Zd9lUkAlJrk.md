## Q&A: Will Gas Pipes have Headlift or Valves?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd9lUkAlJrk
This question was possibly duplicated with a more recent answer: February 26th, 2021 Instagram AMA Q&A: Will we need some kind of pumps to get the gases to a height??

### Transcript

> you guys uh will gas pipes have head
>
> lift boosters or valves i think this is
>
> kind of touched on in the video
>
> um jay said we haven't really decided
>
> yet how the
>
> the uh head lift will work but it sounds
>
> like we're not gonna have that lift or
>
> for gases yeah for now we have a uh
>
> prototype running wall prototype it's
>
> completely functional it just doesn't
>
> use head lift it just goes wherever it
>
> wants to go
>
> fills up the pipe evenly completely so
>
> as long as you have to correct
>
> throughput it will always end up at the
>
> right place and you don't need
>
> to have pumps a lot of people suggested
>
> we do reverse that lift that was
>
> actually my initial proposal as well
>
> when i started kind of thinking about
>
> the guesses back when we were doing
>
> update free
>
> uh but for now we have decided that
>
> probably we'll be sticking with the no
>
> head lift
>
> again it's kind of the same thing with
>
> the gases where we'll probably be
>
> rolling it out like that and then if we
>
> decide that it's like maybe not not
>
> interesting enough that way
>
> we will be looking to further uh improve
>
> it with adding more features potentially
>
> like a compressor that you
>
> need to do like reverse head lifting so
>
> you need to push them down instead of up
>
> uh maybe manage throughput that way
>
> those kind of things they're still on
>
> the table but for now
>
> we're kind of sticking with the no

> headlift i think gotcha
