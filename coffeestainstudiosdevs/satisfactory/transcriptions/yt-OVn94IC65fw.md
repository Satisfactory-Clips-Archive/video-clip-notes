> uh could we expect the game on consoles someday um sorry sorry if it's already been answered uh the it has been answered uh on almost every single stream but i actually haven't set up this stream so it's okay currently we don't have any plans for it we don't have any plans for for satisfactory on console um that's because we want to focus on pc for now and like make the game as best as it can be on pc that's not that's to say we will never do console um but it's it's uh it's it's nothing we look at right now it's not even some it's not even something we consider at the moment um just because we want to finish it first on pc before we start thinking about that stuff and given how far we've thought about this and how far we still have with satisfactory i would say like on playstation 4 and like xbox 360. wait no xbox one i don't think it's gonna happen on that generation of consoles if we do it it's gonna be like later but yeah long story short no plans for it currently might happen in the future would be cool
