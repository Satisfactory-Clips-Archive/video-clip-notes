> um uh is there a
>
> plan to add screens to the game or is it
>
> late game i haven't seen it yet no we
>
> don't have it in the game currently
>
> um and do we have any plans or screens i
>
> don't think we do
>
> like modders we do have plans for signs
>
> but not like
>
> maybe that's what you're asking actually
>
> we do have plans for signs
>
> um so you can like write like poop
>
> and then we'll show it in the game i
>
> don't know when that will happen it
>
> won't happen in update four as far as i
>
> know
>
> no no it'll be a later thing uh
>
> and and the reason for that i i know a
>
> lot of people ask like why is it
>
> difficult to make science when it's such
>
> a highly requested feature
>
> uh is because when we started making
>
> signs
>
> we actually have started working on this
>
> we started working on signs we realized
>
> like so many more use cases for them
>
> and a small feature grew
>
> so much when we started like
>
> implementing it and testing it out
>
> and we realized that we want to put more
>
> effort into it
>
> um and dedicate time for it
>
> so that's why science hasn't happened
>
> yet um
>
> and i guess we could have just made some
>
> placeholder like
>
> and just upgraded as we go we haven't
>
> done that though because we felt like
>
> let's make a whole update about science
>
> instead or something like that i don't
>
> know what the plan is here but
>
> uh yeah i think it could be a major
>
> feature that's yeah
>
> so so that's the reason why it hasn't
>
> been released yet it's not that we won't
>
> don't want it it's we want actually
>
> we really want it we want to make it
>
> super good that's the main reason
