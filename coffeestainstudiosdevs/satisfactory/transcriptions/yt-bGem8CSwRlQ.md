> 
> engine upgrade uh out this year but
> 
> it's looking like that won't be done
> 
> until like
> 
> this week essentially and
> 
> it that kind of makes it like worthless
> 
> for us in a sense
> 
> um because it's it's risky to put that
> 
> out with that proper
> 
> like without being able to like handle
> 
> whatever issues that come up
> 
> so like if we put a build out on
> 
> experimental right now where
> 
> we don't really know the state of it um
>

> 
> actually be going even when we get back
> 
> the fixmas event will be live until
> 
> monday january 18th so there's still
>

> 
> time to be able to test out like
> 
> the full stuff that you can get in the
> 
> advent calendar from the christmas event
> 
> so that's still going to go on we were
> 
> really hoping to get the engine upgrade
> 
> out this year but
> 
> it'd be like it do um i don't think
> 
> anyone's surprised honestly
> 
> uh especially not us uh we were
> 
> surprised that we were
> 
> able to get the both the fluid update
> 
> and the fixmas update on time so
> 
> we'll take that we'll take those wins
> 
> over over
> 
> delaying the the engine upgrade um
> 
> your company vacation until 18th no no
> 
> no the the
> 
> the fixmas event that you can play in
> 
> game
> 
> the in-game event will go on until
> 
> january 18th we'll be back before then
> 
> um
> 
> it's i think the whole studio will be
> 
> back on the
> 
> 11th at the latest um
> 
> but there's going to be people working i
> 
> think before that even
> 
> um not like i don't know how people have
> 
> set up their vacation time
> 
> but the stream won't be back until the
> 
> 12th january
> 
> so we're taking some extra
> 
> extra good old three weeks of doing jack
> 
> 
> 
> uh what we can expect in the end upgrade
> 
> improved performance uh yeah improved
> 
> performance um
> 
> there are some
> 
> i think the best answer to this is to
> 
> check out jace's video he put out on the
> 
> engine upgrade
> 
> i'm going to find that real quick jase
> 
> put out a video a couple of weeks ago
> 
> where
> 
> when we made that video we really
> 
> thought we were going to get the engine
> 
> upgrade out like
> 
> that week or the next week after that
> 
> that video also has my favorite
> 
> thumbnail we've ever done at the history
> 
> of ever i copy stain
> 
> uh so if you have any ques like you can
> 
> check out that video after the stream or
> 
> during the stream if you don't give a
> 
>  before you do
> 
> uh where jace goes like in to depth
> 
> what the engine upgrade specifically
> 
> will will have or do but essentially the
> 
> tldr situation is that
> 
> the engine upgrade will fix some things
> 
> like hopefully improve some performance
> 
> it will kind of like the the base work
> 
> for
> 
> uh some of features that would be coming
> 
> for satisfactory
> 
> um from from our point of view like
> 
> stuff that can help us
> 
> lay the groundwork to be able to
> 
> implement uh more optimized
> 
> stuff there's also the potential to have
> 
> a
> 
> way better like color picker system so
> 
> it would have
> 
> pretty much an infinite amount of colors
> 
> uh instead of just 16 spots
> 
> um i think that's one of the hypest
> 
> things
> 
> from that um
> 
> yeah it's just good we'll be coming
