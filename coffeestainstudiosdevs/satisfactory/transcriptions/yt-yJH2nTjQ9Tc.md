>
> burp no um i started programming visual
>
> basic
>
> uh when i was like
>
> 12 13. um and i was i guess it was
>
> mostly because my dad was programming in
>
> visual basic and so i just kind of
>
> started learning on that oh and the ti
>
> calculators
>
> which is like yeah i would write simple
>
> little
>
> skit things on that and i really liked
>
> it and i always liked
>
> video games my whole life so i kind of
>
> just
>
> started trying to make video games and i
>
> started doing that in visual basic

>
> um that wasn't really for games that was
>
> just to learn c and then i went to
>
> school
>
> for it yeah and just kept kept at it
>
> and in yeah in high school though this
>
> was annoying right before
>
> i saw somebody wrote c plus plus high
>
> school right before i was going to take
>
> the
>
> programming the one course they had they
>
> switched from c
>
> plus to java so what a slap in the face
>

> especially when you're yeah i wondered i
>
> took that course i took a course in java
>
> really i did i did it in high school
>
> oh yeah i took java in uni at university
>
> because we had to do every
>
> every type of programming so
>
> we did functional programming course we
>
> did a object oriented one we did a
>
> uh we did c
>
> c yeah it's weird because i i remember c
>
> being really similar to c plus plus
>
> yeah and then when it it doesn't feel
>
> that way anymore
>
> yeah but i guess c plus plus has come a
>
> long way and
>
> c's kind of gone its own way i think
>
> ziploc has gone a long way but i don't
>
> think they're teaching any of the new
>
> stuff
>
> i that's the other thing when you see
>
> some of the new things you're like
>
> wait what that's okay that's never
>
> taught about like smart pointers
>
> and smart pointers is like the so i
>
> don't understand why they're not
>
> teaching that
>
> at least not at my where i went to
>
> yeah they tend to focus on more than
>
> the lower like the core side of it
>
> but yeah a lot of sorting
>
> algorithms
