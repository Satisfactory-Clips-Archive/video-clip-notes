> i do that why can modders make so much more con content in short time in the studio is that actually even true do they actually make more content i mean i think they do there's like there's so many modders yeah there's more for starters but but like because there are a lot of mods that doesn't mean they're making a lot of content yeah right like we're we're making new things like a lot of new things from scratch there are some modders who also make a lot of new things we're also reconfiguring some core stuff with the game that you can't really do with mods yeah but then the the other thing that i've talked about with models as well is you got to remember that modders and developers have a different level of responsibility for uh what their you know their their mod or what what the updates of the game uh will have so developers we have a responsibility to make sure that anything we add to the game adds to the entire game uh it works for everyone we're we're trying to appease as many people uh not just hardcore people um and and it must work well it should hopefully be bug free um user experience needs to be really good we have a lot of responsibility to get all these things right and everything we do must also factor in well with the future vision we have with the game so there's a lot of responsibility developers have for the content they're making that modders just don't have that responsibility yeah now that's not to say modders don't create high quality things they clearly do but modders like you don't you don't actually have this responsibility to take all of that stuff into account when you make a mod you can make a mod that just helps you and a you know a niche portion of the community who might be really hardcore who want a specific thing you know your mod might target just them and they don't care if it's a little janky here and there or if the ui isn't quite right um if it just functions well enough it's it's fine you know so that's that's what like the responsibility is a little different between developers and modders that's kind of why yeah and there's also uh modders don't necessarily have to uh care for like the interoperability between mods as well so like if someone's making one mod and another one's making one mod they're not necessarily like trying to figure like does it do our mods work well together they kind of find that out as they're like you know making it whereas we need to do that for everything we make
