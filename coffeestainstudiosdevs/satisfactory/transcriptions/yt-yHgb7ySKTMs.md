### Transcript

> when will you see the crab ooh that's a really good question uh i would wager in update five actually if i had to take a guess this is me guessing um the reason why so we wanted the big crab to be in update three but we needed to overhaul by the way holy i just realized something when me and jay's went to like geneva and record sorry we went to cern and we recorded like a video for update three right when we went to make that video we had no idea what the update was gonna contain so we just had a bunch of that was like all right maybe this is in the game and this is in the game um and i remember just it was such a pain in the ass to cut out the the big enemy crap thing because we thought we were gonna do that ft3 we didn't um so we were planning to have that in update three but we couldn't because the way the ai system works right now with the mesh the nav mesh is kind of annoying and it would just break so it would just be so buggy so we didn't want to do it uh and now we realize like okay if we want to implement that crab we have to fix that ai system and that's probably a lot more work than we think um so i don't think it's slated for update four but maybe for update five because we do need to to refactor that ai system um so yeah hopefully update five i think at the like at the um earliest you'd see it in update five is my guess
