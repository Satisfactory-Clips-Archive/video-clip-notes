> uh and while we're speaking of mods yeah
> 
> steam workshop support
> 
> so uh steam workshop support isn't uh
> 
> like isn't guaranteed
> 
> um i know like steam workshop is awesome
> 
> don't get me wrong um the the problem
> 
> with steam workshop
> 
> is that we don't want
> 
> like we kind of see mods as like an
> 
> integral part of satisfactory and we've
> 
> always
> 
> thought of mods as like kind of an
> 
> integral part of satisfactory
> 
> because this is a really like this is a
> 
> game that we see a lot of modding
> 
> potential right and we've always seen
> 
> that and that's why we've developed in
> 
> certain ways so that
> 
> monster is simple to implement and we're
> 
> even amazed that
> 
> mods have already been made we did not
> 
> think that people are going to be able
> 
> to dish out so many mods before we even
> 
> have like proper mod support because we
> 
> will have official mod support at some
> 
> point
> 
> um however the most important aspect of
> 
> this
> 
> is the ecosystem of mods right so
> 
> if one of the important aspects to us is
> 
> that we want to be able to
> 
> to support both the epic and the steam
> 
> version equally we don't want
> 
> we want to we don't want it to be the
> 
> case where like the steam version is the
> 
> one that has all the good mods and the
> 
> epic version doesn't have any cool mods
> 
> right
> 
> so we don't want that happen we want
> 
> there to be an equal spread
> 
> um that way it's important for us that
> 
> like the people that make mods
> 
> it's like a nice ecosystem for them
> 
> more so than it is like easy to download
> 
> it if you're on steam
> 
> uh and i know that like epic are work
> 
> like i think they're
> 
> about to release their version of
> 
> workshop on epic if they
> 
> haven't already i think that that would
> 
> be bigger news though but uh they are
> 
> working on their own version of that but
> 
> even if they do
> 
> like make their own version of that and
> 
> we have like both steam workshop and
> 
> the epic version of their like if it's a
> 
> pain in the ass
> 
> for people that are making mods to like
> 
> upload it to like vice versa
> 
> store then like we want to support the
> 
> mods we want to be
> 
> able to like distribute monster equally
> 
> so in that case we'd rather put in the
> 
> work and like make a
> 
> you know an in-game mod store or you
> 
> know
> 
> i don't know like tie in the mod manager
> 
> somehow i don't know how we would do
> 
> that
> 
> but uh like that's that's the
> 
> long-winded answer to like why
> 
> steam workshop isn't like guaranteed to
> 
> happen maybe it will
> 
> maybe won't but that's essentially why
> 
> uh
> 
> why you get such a shitty answer for
> 
> that um
> 
> and and what i think is gonna happen is
> 
> we're gonna make our own mod
> 
> like loader or something like that or or
> 
> maybe get help from the modding
> 
> community and we can
> 
> together make something i don't know
> 
> but essentially we want to yeah the
> 
> ecosystem for mods has to be great and
> 
> that's important to us
>
