### Transcript

> so that's the packager right there there
> 
> you are
> 
> and uh yeah for prosperity like there's
> 
> no mark ii
> 
> uh it's called mark one for some reason
> 
> i don't know why
> 
> even the constructors are called mark
> 
> one and there's no mark two constructor
> 
> so i think or is there
> 
> i don't know i don't know where to put
> 
> it jase come on you [ __ ]
> 
> keep [ __ ] putting our credibility at
> 
> [ __ ] risk every single time
> 
> but what if there is one though no
> 
> that's not um
> 
> uh yeah so that's the packager um
> 
> and uh it's uh it's for fluids maybe
> 
> should be called fluid the packager but
> 
> it's
> 
> right now in the village just called the
> 
> packager and it's essentially the same
> 
> fundamental like um
> 
> [Music]
> 
> functionality as the refinery has with
> 
> the packaging so it packages and
> 
> unpackages
> 
> recipes the same way as it does in the
> 
> refinery but it consumes
> 
> consumes less power and is way smaller
> 
> so it fits in a single foundation and
> 
> it's less than three walls high
> 
> kind of sounds like a smurf but it's not
> 
> uh
> 
> and yeah it's essentially just a super
> 
> tiny refinery now
> 
> the the refineries that exist in the
> 
> game
> 
> that are that you're using for packaging
> 
> and unpackaging they will still work the
> 
> same way
> 
> so if you already like all the f
> 
> refineries you've set up for this type
> 
> of
> 
> like setup they will work just fine uh
> 
> in the update but you will not be able
> 
> to build
> 
> new ones so that's kind of how we're
> 
> migrating over
> 
> the functionality of the package so so
> 
> to speak so yeah
> 
> it's got the same functionality as a
> 
> refinery the only exception is that
> 
> um it doesn't do uh
> 
> it doesn't create diluted fuel which is
> 
> an actual process where we actually mix
> 
> fluids so it doesn't make sense to have
> 
> that in the fluid
> 
> packager uh i know there's like a mod on
> 
> the community like the mo
> 
> packager mod for the community does do
> 
> that but we felt like that's
> 
> way too overpowered with certain setups
> 
> so and it does make sense to have that
> 
> in packages that's more of a refinery
> 
> feature
> 
> and yeah it's essentially a super tiny
> 
> refinery and it costs 10 plastic
> 
> 10 rubber and 20 steel beams and it
> 
> consumes 10 megawatts of power
> 
> [ __ ] [ __ ] that's a good that's the
> 
> iron james is really impressed oh here
> 
> we go i got a lot of cement
> 
> and i am not building foundations so
> 
> i'm stealing some of that
>
