### Transcript

> so we usually start off with like just a quick like recap kind of what was going on uh development wise for the game and we've been kind of quiet since update 4 was released on ea because we're kind of figuring out what we're making for update five and i guess that's the the the agenda was muted exactly you were right chad all along um so uh we're kind of figuring out what we want to make for update five we have announced that update 5 is the next update update 5 is coming sometime this fall um we haven't decided on a date fully yet because we're thinking of releasing update 5 sometime after our vacation that's kind of happening sometime like july august i don't know exactly in sweden there's a thing in sweden where like we just like shut down uh and coffee stain is no exception to that so coffee stain will also have like a little break um if you've been with us before you know about this because this is the period when everyone's like you guys sure are on vacation a lot or for like a long time it's when everyone goes on vacation and i don't and i just hold before bed exactly uh and this year will be no it's me and chat excellent community yeah um so we're in that between phase we're working on update five we've made a lot of progress on update five i think uh it feels like we have made a lot of progress at least but we're not quite ready yet to reveal exactly what update five will contain but we will sooner or later um same thing with update4 we're going to like roll out t users and and updates to you guys and uh both to like show off kind of what we're working on but also to give get a little bit of feedback on like maybe directions we're going with certain things um so we'll see with that but right now in that that awkward like in between phase where we don't have any like real news um apart from that we're working on stuff um and yeah here we are i guess here we are um i think i think that's it so i'm trying to think like what have we confirmed so far update five we have talked about that update five uh was going to be sort of catered towards the the like the build system in the game so when we released update 4 we launched it with a bug where the foundations had collision and chat would be like what do you mean bug isn't supposed to have collision that's weird and that's what we thought as well but uh apparently a lot of people have been using that bug where like some foundations didn't have collision to be able to like build in certain ways and that kind of opened our eyes to like how we kind of needed to rework a little bit the build system and like how to play the game when you're building stuff because some some setups are kind of hard to do without the cheat creep if you will um sometimes if you're building like tight corners and you have splitters that you want to stack up to certain degrees it's really hard to do if you if you are limited by the uh the uh what's the thing where you're building close to the collision of other buildings and stuff like that clearance clearance that was the word i'm looking for um that's why i'm here thanks intern um so so that's what we we're one part of update 5 is going to be focusing a little bit about that and trying to improve that um and i think that's the only thing we've really confirmed so far for update five so that's still pretty exciting yeah you know like there hasn't been any like i feel like there hasn't been any like really major reworks in that area right no we haven't touched that system in a long time and it's something that everyone uses 99 of the time so i've heard
