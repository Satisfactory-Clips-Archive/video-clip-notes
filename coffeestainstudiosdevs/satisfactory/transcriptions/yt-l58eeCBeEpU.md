> you get so much more out of it so the use use case for dedicated services specifically so you can have a centralized file that doesn't require a specific person to host the file titles dedicated servers aren't needed after the fixes is there any thoughts on how to handle this um well we're going to have them regardless because some people like them but yeah you're right so it's like uh this the save file is always available for everyone you and your friends or whatever to play on uh no one has to like leave their pc on or or uh splitting save files around or something like that um but that's not to say there won't be any differences having a dedicated server for example like that will process all that stuff whereas your pc won't have to process a server as well as the game rendering and [ __ ] like that so there's a benefit there however one downside is everyone playing will be a client and will have the client experience which is going to be lag or whatever bugs and issues you have right now as a client in the game everyone will have them

> but yeah i mean there are other appeals like when i said that before i didn't like i think the majority of people think that uh the solution to those problems is with a dedicated server but it's not it's us fixing the game but there are like obviously good benefits of having a digital server but like you can have the safari running overnight and they can connect to it and like it's easy to share the save file in that sense and if you have like if everyone you're playing with have like a scrappy computer then yeah then that will be a bit better because the server if you're hosting you do need to like maintain both like the server connectivity stuff as well as running the game so you do save a bit of that so there's like i don't i'm not saying that there's no appeal with dedicated servers uh i just mean that the dedicated server won't fix it's not a one-all solution that will fix all things
