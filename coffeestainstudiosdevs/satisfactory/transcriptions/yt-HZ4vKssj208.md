> satisfactory roadmap we don't really
>
> have a roadmap because
>
> it's we had a roadmap and uh
>
> we didn't like it we we
>
> roadmap this is a huge topic on roadmaps
>
> but the problem with road maps for us is
>
> that
>
> we we can't like obviously we're
>
> committed with working on the game but
>
> we can't commit to a roadmap to the
>
> extent that we need
>
> like if we need to crunch at some point
>
> to meet deadlines we're not gonna
>
> we need to delay and i think it's a
>
> little bit frustrating for everyone when
>
> we're
>
> constantly delaying stuff um i think
>
> this
>
> dev cycle that we've had last year has
>
> been
>
> really good for for both of us uh both
>
> for you guys and for us
>
> just because like we've had time to do
>
> the things we want to do
>
> we haven't been stressing about like we
>
> need to do this we need to do this we
>
> need to get this out and like our
>
> decisions are based on you know
>
> what's best for the game rather than
>
> when is this coming out
>
> um and that's we want to keep doing that
>
> that's one reason
>
> the other reason is that we're
>
> constantly changing our minds based on
>
> you know when we're prototyping stuff
>
> and realize this isn't a good idea or
>
> when we produce yourself and realize ooh
>
> what if we did it this way instead and
>
> change our minds on certain things
>
> we want to be able to do that still and
>
> it's also so that we can kind of react
>
> to what you guys are doing
>
> saying to us so for instance pipes would
>
> not have been possible
>
> if we would have kept our roadmap going
>
> pipes would not have happened
>
> at that point so yeah we really want to
>
> keep that agile development going and
>
> not get stuck in like
>
> the the world map kind of thinking i
>
> know that's really frustrating to hear
>
> because obviously you want to know like
>
> what's coming and what to look forward
>
> to
>
> and you know if you know that like oh
>
> i'm really looking forward to this thing
>
> that's going to come in
>
> this part of the year like we're going
>
> to try and like be as open about
>
> development as we can we've been fairly
>
> open
>
> in for update four saying what's going
>
> to come
>
> but we're going to try and be even more
>
> open and let you guys know what's kind
>
> of in the pipeline what might change
>
> keep you in the loop et cetera et cetera
>
> we're going to figure sing things out
>
> that way instead of
>
> you know having a static road map on the
>
> on the
>
> on the uh on the website or something
>
> like that because you feel like also
>
> doing that way
>
> this kind of communication where we have
>
> our streams we have a youtube channel we
>
> have
>
> you know our twitter and stuff like that
>
> um it gives us a better
>
> way to like keep keep
>
> engaged with you guys as well so that we
>
> don't become you know
>
> boomer game developers that just like
>
> we're just gonna do this thing and we're
>
> so set on it we want to like be able to
>
> do
>
> what makes sense for the game and what
>
> makes the game better um
>
> and we feel like a road map is a little
>
> bit hindering us
>
> in that sense roman is a joke and
>
> burns all devs yeah it can't it can do
>
> that
>
> there are way i think there are ways to
>
> do to have road maps that kind of work
>
> and we've also talked a lot about having
>
> like some middle ground where maybe
>
> we'll do like a
>
> white board or something like that
>
> showing like this is what we're looking
>
> to implement at some point but we don't
>
> know when
>
> um and maybe like that will also be
>
> easier to like confirm like these are
>
> the things that we confirm
>
> want to have in satisfactory but even
>
> those things can change like there might
>
> be things that we
>
> feel like this needs to be in the game
>
> but then maybe we
>
> aren't able to implement it so and that
>
> can also be very frustrating so
>
> it's a tricky it's a tricky situation
>
> we're trying our best to
>
> to figure out what to do about that
>
> as we go but working on the game making
>
> the game as best as it can be is the
>
> priority for us
>
> so really sorry that that answer got so
>
> long
>
> but we really want to make the game the
>
> best it can be
>
> and sometimes we need to take decisions
>
> that
>
> suck for you guys but in the long haul i
>
> think will be better for you guys
>
> uh in that sense so all right
>
> got that out of the way
