> subscribe updates about dedicated
> 
> servers so
> 
> guys the i mean it's a thing that i've
> 
> come to just accept with my life that
> 
> every week we'll
> 
> have to answer dedicated service but the
> 
> one thing that you guys can just
> 
> uh just know is that we're constantly
> 
> working on them
> 
> and uh it's it's hard to
> 
> it's hard to give you any answer other
> 
> than it's being worked on because the
> 
> the nature of the task
> 
> is one that is uh is chipped away slowly
> 
> over time
> 
> um so until you know
> 
> we're closer to any kind of uh
> 
> breakthrough to
> 
> maybe like alpha testing the dedicated
> 
> servers or something
> 
> in the future um the answer is pretty
> 
> much just going to be the same thing
> 
> uh since yeah we just have to keep
> 
> taking those those little steps until we
> 
> get to a point where we can actually get
> 
> people testing it so
> 
> yeah one failure and then we'll make a
> 
> big announcement of course because that
> 
> would be
> 
> an amazing time one fair point as well
> 
> is that the
> 
> conveyor belt thing that we're doing an
> 
> experimental right now that's part of
> 
> the
> 
> dedicated server work because we did
> 
> like dedicated server encompasses both
> 
> like you know that
> 
> actually running a dedicated server
> 
> which doesn't
> 
> really do much for for anyone at this
> 
> point because
> 
> the biggest issue is still fixing
> 
> multiplayer issues
> 
> so even if we had a mult like the thing
> 
> like that corsair right now is saying
> 
> i'd rather have desync fixed first than
> 
> the dedicated servers
> 
> exactly right because that desync
> 
> doesn't go away with dedicated servers
> 
> exactly the dsync is there because
> 
> there's a problem with multiplayer
> 
> uh that desyncs and so if you had
> 
> dedicated servers you just desync with
> 
> the server yeah um so it that's exactly
> 
> what you're talking about
> 
> yeah and it's also this is like one of
> 
> out of several steps that we're taking
> 
> recently where
> 
> this conveyor belt thing is on
> 
> experimental right now and we're testing
> 
> that that's part of like the work that
> 
> needs to go into dedicated servers
> 
> but there's also the engine upgrade
> 
> which has that a few desync
> 
> fixes that's also going to come to
> 
> experimental which will also solve a few
> 
> things that will then
> 
> you know be bundled in together with
> 
> dedicated servers because like you said
> 
> like just having a server
> 
> like a headless server running instead
> 
> of a listen server that we're doing
> 
> right now
> 
> it doesn't actually improve the game
> 
> that much
> 
> um i guess like the argument is that
> 
> people would like the ability to like
> 
> run you know a game
> 
> without having to like wait for your
> 
> friend to be online or whatever
> 
> doesn't work if it crashes in between
> 
> yeah if it crashed in between like
> 
> it's not gonna work regardless um but
> 
> there are kind of like workarounds right
> 
> now
> 
> like if if if you're playing with
> 
> friends and you don't want to wait for
> 
> them to be online like just
> 
> set up some way you can share the save
> 
> file and pass that around
> 
> even though it's a bit inconvenient
> 
> right now because it's
> 
> pretty much like it's going to be the
> 
> same game when dedicated servers come
> 
> out as well
> 
> so i don't know that that's i guess
> 
> that's like a
> 
> a uh a shitty uh excuse or something
> 
> but uh it's all part like the stuff that
> 
> we're doing on experimental right now is
> 
> part of dedicated service so
> 
> you're you're all seeing the work we're
> 
> putting into dedicated services it
> 
> doesn't look like it really yeah because
> 
> you're not getting a dedicated server
> 
> but
> 
> you're getting the work that's necessary
> 
> yeah yeah
>
