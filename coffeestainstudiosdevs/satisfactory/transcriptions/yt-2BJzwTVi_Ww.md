### Transcript

> um anything
>
> else what material are they going to use
>
> for the new pipes do you have any of the
>
> yeah that kind of [ __ ] i do know
>
> uh let me just look up my notes here
>
> real quick
>
> because i did get that like two years
>
> ago
>
> uh um so the one thing i can say about
>
> the difference between the mark ii pump
>
> and the mark one pump is that uh the way
>
> they're balanced right now it's
>
> if you already have like a bunch of mark
>
> 1 pumps set up
>
> you there's no real gain of replacing
>
> them with mark 2 pumps
>
> uh you might even actually lose out a
>
> little bit on power because the
>
> mark ii pumps are a little bit more
>
> power consuming than the regular mark 1
>
> pumps
>
> um unless like you really need the
>
> material from mark one pumps or like one
>
> wanted to look nice um
>
> then i guess that's the thing because
>
> here's the thing uh
>
> as of this patch when you're upgrading
>
> pipe mark one to mark two you can do
>
> that same way
>
> you do with conveyor belts where like
>
> you aim at the pipe and then you just
>
> pipe mark two uh you can't do that with
>
> mark ii
>
> pumps though right now uh just because
>
> of the reason that you said
>
> that you actually lose a bit of power by
>
> doing that
>
> um but if y'all really really really
>
> want that feature
>
> uh make sure to slap that on our keyway
>
> site uh
>
> questions.satisfactory.
>
> and let us know that you want to be able
>
> to upgrade
>
> pumps the same way you can do with belts
>
> um
>
> but okay so pumps cost
>
> two motors eight plastic and four aclad
>
> sheets
>
> uh so they're quite expensive and they
>
> consume 12 megawatts of power
>
> and i don't remember what the mark one
>
> uses but i think it's 10 megawatts
>
> so they're a little bit more power
>
> hungry
>
> but there's the same size as smart one
>
> pumps uh
>
> and did it yeah exactly
>
> so it allows 10 more uh before actually
>
> stops pumping so you can place them 55
>
> meters
>
> effectively which which you get is from
>
> the the head lift snap so i was right
>
> about that one at least um let's see
>
> if there's anything else yeah that's
>
> pretty much it and mark
>
> ii pipelines cost uh one plastic and one
>
> aluminium backlight sheet so they're
>
> also
>
> quite expensive um and
>
> the pipes are unlocked in tier seven
>
> and uh well maybe i should spoil that i
>
> don't know but in the box i
>
> fire fine and the same thing for pumps
>
> they're also
>
> uh unlocked there but valves they're a
>
> different story
>
> and i don't know what they're but maybe
>
> they're also unlocked there it doesn't
>
> actually say my notes
>
> so yeah i think they're
>
> before tier seven actually
>
> about to find out so yeah that's the
>
> cost of
>
> of those right now and like with with
>
> anything with the game
>
> you know all the the like costs of
>
> recipes and whatnot
>
> that might change somewhat in the future
>
> um
>
> if you feel like something is too
>
> expensive or something is too cheap make
>
> sure to let us know on the keyway site
>
> um and yeah give us feedback on what the
>
> [ __ ] going on
>
> in the game
