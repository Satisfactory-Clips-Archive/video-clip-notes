### Transcript

> um i got a question about how does this
> 
> industrial storage container decide what
> 
> comes out the bottom what comes at the
> 
> top
> 
> that's a really good question i don't
> 
> know like
> 
> i think it talks about the top power
> 
> bottoms on the bottom
> 
> i think it prioritizes one or the other
> 
> for each stack so like once it starts
> 
> feeding out a stack
> 
> it will pick one output and then
> 
> that will be prioritized so like if you
> 
> have two conveyor belts and it
> 
> and you place like a stack of whatever
> 
> i think that stack will only come out
> 
> the bottom
> 
> if if i remember correctly um
> 
> and i don't know what the like i think
> 
> it's like half
> 
> finished so i don't know if we've
> 
> decided yet whether that's how we want
> 
> to do it or if we want to do like where
> 
> you get like it alternates
> 
> um i thought it just alternated maybe it
> 
> does
> 
> i'm not quite sure and jace
> 
> you haven't unlocked that yet right so
> 
> you can't test it what's what's that
> 
> several buildings
> 
> the industrial like the oh no no mark ii
> 
> uh caution is recommended during use i
> 
> think it depends on which belt is
> 
> connected first oh maybe that's what it
> 
> is
> 
> there's some finicky logic in there i
> 
> think um
> 
> i would suggest uploading that on the
> 
> question side actually so we if it's
> 
> something that a lot of people are
> 
> annoyed by
> 
> we we get like the uh sort of
> 
> notification by it
> 
> um did i not just do the jump pad thing
> 
> or do you not get it until it gets back
> 
> i thought you get it
> 
> it's unlocked right away yeah
> 
> yeah you've unlocked it it's under like
> 
> uh
> 
> movement or something it's not it's not
> 
> an equipment it's unbuildable
> 
> yeah so open your bill menu
> 
> oh yeah i'm a idiot yeah i knew
> 
> that
> 
> bottom feed priority okay so that's what
> 
> it is
> 
> but we may change that in the future i
> 
> don't know what the preferred one is
> 
> actually honestly i think we just like
> 
> implemented it and left it
> 
> and didn't really like evaluate it
