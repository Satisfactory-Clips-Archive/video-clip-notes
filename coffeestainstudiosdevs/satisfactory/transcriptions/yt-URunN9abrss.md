> do i have a favorite mod i haven't here's the thing i haven't looked at the recent mods i also haven't looked at mods since after update 4. uh it's been a while since i did that um i think the mod that has been blowing me away the most is the network's fixit networks one where you can like program like logic in the game that's really cool because that really opens up like the game to be way more than just a game but there are some really cool mods like the farming mod was really awesome uh when we saw a showcase of that um and the smart mod like the smartphone has a lot of cool stuff with the buildings and whatnot the way the way the way you build rather and like neat little quirks like the there's one thing that i've wanted to add for for satisfactory a long time is like the the preview of like belts and stuff that's something that smart mod does i'm pretty sure um so that's also like nice to see a confirmation of like that idea that i had in my head it works exactly how i imagined it in in the mod so like i get i said it before like mods are great for us to confirm uh ideas um our reactions is also pretty useful uh i i although i'll say that like like air reactions is a great mod when you're like when you have a plan and stuff like that but it doesn't appeal to me personally because i like the uh the like lo-fi i'm building this sort of situation like i prefer that over just like pacing in a bunch of foundations
