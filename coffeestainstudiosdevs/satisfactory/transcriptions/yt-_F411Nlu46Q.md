>
> i think it was the first like gameplay
>
> reveal trailer
>
> uh rams did i not say ramps
>
> um one of the early
>
> trailers we had an idea of building a
>

>
> you'd have like
>
> pillars going up and you had the the
>
> stuff going into them
>
> e3 one i think it was one after that um
>
> possibly but i just remember because the

> trailer team like
>
> sometimes they do it in editor sometimes
>
> they do it in the save file
>

>
> save files and then suddenly we would
>
> run into someone else's factory and
>
> we're like what the

> what's going on and this was a thing
>
> that happened a lot
>
> like they'd save vehicles and random
>
> placements in the world and stuff like
>
> that
>
> um so uh and since then i'm pretty sure
>
> we've we've moved all the trailer stuff
>
> away from doing that way just because it
>
> got really annoying
>
> sounds like a good multiplayer feature
>
> yeah well it happened in single player
>
> too
>
> it was just like you'd love your own
>
> save file and you'd have someone else's
>
> factory in there
