### Transcript

> uh yes here's a question that i've been wanting to i almost answered on twitter but uh i got distracted by something else so um this question is about perform i i talk off i often talk about performance budget uh when we talked about optimization and we specifically talk often talk about when we talk about lights and stuff um and and so so the question is like what does performance budget mean really so performance budget is like a loose term but but the the generally the way you see it is like performance budget is when you're rendering a frame right you're you're often shooting for a target frame rate you have a target frame rate and you have a minimum uh viable frame rate where like we're shooting for you know 60 fps i think that's like our goal and that's kind of reasonable um but we also have a minimum viable um frame rate which is like at like what's the lowest frame rate you can play the game and it's still okay you know and you know that that minimum viable frame rate differs based on like what kind of game it is um so like if you're playing a a a music rhythm game for instance then your minimum viable frame rate might be 60 fps like you have to have at least 60 fps and stuff like that um blah blah blah anyway so the performance budget that i keep mentioning is we often say okay so if our target frame rate is 60 fps that means that each frame is rendered in 16 milliseconds right um so that means if if all the aspects that are in the game that does any kind of logic stuff and like updates you know that runs on the cpu or gpu whatever that needs to run with under that um that target time right so often when we when we talk about the budget we mean like okay if if we have 16 milliseconds to to be able to perform everything we need to perform each tick each update frame kind of so like if if it takes one millisecond to run like the logic for your factory if it takes one millisecond to um to update like all the enemies in the game and stuff like that if it takes four milliseconds to to do something else blah blah blah like all that stuff adds up um and and you know that's what determines what frame rate you get um and if we have when we measure stuff we measured in a low um low uh hard like low spec hardware kind of and so so for instance if we have like systems where like if if rendering takes eight milliseconds right now in the game then we can't re and like that means that we bloat the the budget that means we can't reasonably add anything that's gonna add like another millisecond because we're still we're still exceeding our performance budget right so that's what i'm referring to when i'm talking about like stuff like that so and and pr we'll probably talk about this a bit with with kafka maybe about light specifically because he he knows uh more about that than i do but it's the same thing there like if we add lights then okay we need to have room for that kind of in the budget which means okay if we're gonna add lights we have to shrink down like the the way you use it to have like the general use case for that to be as few milliseconds as possible and then they also we also need to be able to afford somewhere else in our budget to like get something out in the budget and to be able to fit it in you know in the schedule kind of so long story short it's just like all these different things in the game that is taking up cpu time and taking up rendering time like if we're gonna add lights we need to be able to fit that in that budget and this is something we talk about game development in general like you know how some games can have like really accurate simulation going on whereas in other games it's just like so like we don't have physics in satisfactory for instance and that is because that's such a big part of the budget but if we remove physics then we have room for other things that we can do like all the rendering stuff i'm logging so yes very very long question or answer but yeah um i just read like drawing chaos snoot body as like dude are you okay do you want to sit down like um and yeah like multi-threaded stuff is one thing that we we when we added support for that more support for that that means that oh we cleared up some some space in the budget so we can add this thing and that's what we used to add pipes so like when we added the multi-threading stuff that's currently in the game we got this big hole in the budget and we're like all right let's cram pipes and that um so it's it's a balancing act of figuring out what you can and can't afford to to run in your game and satisfactory uh unfortunately is one of those games where it scales so like you can you can have like a ton of stuff in the game that will affect cpu time so yes
