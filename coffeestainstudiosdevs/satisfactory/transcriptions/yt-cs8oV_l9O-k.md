This question was possibly duplicated with a more recent answer: [February 26th, 2021 Instagram AMA Q&A: I'm on Early Access, how do I get in on this Experimental stuff?](./yt-F-q3vfj__M4,112.71260000000001,182.71586666666667.md) [https://youtube.com/embed/F-q3vfj__M4?autoplay=1&start=112&end=183](https://youtube.com/embed/F-q3vfj__M4?autoplay=1&start=112&end=183)

> uh okay so then there's um can i switch from experiment to early access yep you can switch between them all you like on steam the way you do it is you right click on the game you go to properties uh or whatever and then there's like a beta tab you go there there's a drop down you choose experimental or if you don't want it if you want early access you just choose nothing on epic you have both in your library and you could just install one or both and play you can switch on your save file from experimental from early access to experimental is guaranteed safe but from experimental back to early access if early access is the old version right so if experimental is being developed going back to uh early access may cause issues because you might have new content in experimental that you don't have in exchange but one thing to point out if you're playing on the epic version uh the way cloud save works on the epic end is that they have like two different repositories for the early access version of the game and experimental version of the game so if you've played on early access and you switch to early to experimental the cloud sync will think that oh you're ahead do you want to update so then you want to upload to cloud the version you have locally and that can be really confusing because it may look like i don't have latest version on my end okay and then you download it and you get like an old version that last time you played on experimental or if you've never played an experimental it will completely like remove your folder for some reason so always back up your saves whenever you're switching uh branch this has happened on steam as well i've heard a couple of people run into this issue so just be super super careful with that like pop-up that comes up that actually like to sync the cloud sync thing whenever you switch versions uh and if you're uncertain back up your save and like and save the whole save folder
