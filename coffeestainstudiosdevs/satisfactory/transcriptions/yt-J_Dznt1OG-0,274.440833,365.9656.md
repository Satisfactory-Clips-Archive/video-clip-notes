> has been creating iron ingots we just

> this constructor here we'll see our iron
> ingots come through okay so in this
> constructor we need to see what we want
> to make so now I remember that the
> reinforced iron plates needed screws and
> iron plates screws require iron ingots
> you can see down here iron rods require
> iron ingots and screws require the iron
> rods so the screws are like a two-step
> process right so what we can do is we
> can start trying to make screws so we'll
> need iron rods first in this one and
> then here's another constructor here
> that I've set up and I'll plug this into
> there and then we'll set this one up to
> turn the iron rods into screws okay so
> here come the rods and you can just pick
> things up from here as well if you want
> it's gonna go in here and cool now we're
> producing screws and the last step for
> the screws is to put them into the
> assembler the assembler has two inputs
> you can see that there so we're gonna
> grab a conveyor belt from here put it
> into here and then we'll have screws go
> through great so one thing I forgot to
> do earlier is set the recipe for the
> assembler which is for the reinforced
> iron plate so I'm gonna click on it this
> time and what this will mean is that
> when the screws get here they'll be
> accepted as a resource so don't see it
