> uh okay so will it be possible to use
> 
> decimal places for percentages
> 
> in production in the future
> 
> uh i think we've talked about that
> 
> i don't think there was a specific issue
> 
> with doing that so i think it should be
> 
> possible yeah we
> 
> should definitely definitely do that
> 
> because it's super annoying right now
> 
> that you can't
> 
> make like very precise uh settings
> 
> for the production lines yeah
> 
> yeah especially because you can put in
> 
> what you want the rate per minute to be
> 
> yeah but then it doesn't end up being a
> 
> whole percentage then it changes that
> 
> regardless
> 
> uh something else that's just freaking
> 
> annoying
> 
> yeah this because you can you can change
> 
> that both ways you can both set the
> 
> percentage and
> 
> just set the parts per minute or parts
> 
> per second of what it is
> 
> which i don't think a lot of people
> 
> realize this uh uh or maybe just in
> 
> general that
> 
> you know that production when you have
> 
> the
> 
> your construction or sorry when you have
> 
> your constructable was the words looking
> 
> for when you have the building menu open
> 
> there's like a little uh widget at the
> 
> bottom where you can
> 
> you can see like the percentage wise you
> 
> can actually click on that and like
> 
> type it in you can also type in how many
> 
> parts per minute you want to produce
> 
> and that will update the percentage uh
> 
> but i guess it rounds it up
> 
> to yeah it always wraps it yeah
> 
> and that's what this question is
> 
> specifically about for anyone who is not
> 
> who didn't know about this feature
> 
> because this is this is not something
> 
> that we specifically tell you about
> 
> uh this is something that people just
> 
> find out um
> 
> i think that's one of those polish
> 
> things that we know we want to fix but
> 
> it's
> 
> it's just somewhere in the backlog all
> 
> right hidden away
> 
> because it's not as high priority as
> 
> making like cool new stuff
> 
> most of the time right yeah
