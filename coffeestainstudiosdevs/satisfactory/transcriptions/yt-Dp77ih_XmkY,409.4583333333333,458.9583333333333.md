> GASP
> Oh boy! It's actually happening you guys!
> Drones are here!
> They're designed for long-range, low resource transport
> They can't carry many resources at at time
> But they're doing their best
> Each port can only contain 1 drone but move
> across the map extremely quickly
> And are far easier to setup than trains, belts, or trucks
> Drones require batteries as fuel
> And their consumption rate and travel speed become
> more efficient as delivery distances increase
> Simply put a drone port at 2 separate locations
> Slap a Drone on 1 - or both, to increase throughput
> Connect your ports, hook up your batteries
> And the Drone will fly back and forth delivering
> whatever you put in the port
