> Yeah, you can get some nice drifts.
> I wanted the tunings to get better.
> The Explorer is pretty hard to tune well,
> and make it fun and reliable, but you know, it's getting there.
> It's gone through many iterations as well, and will continue to go through more.
> It definitely needs some more improvements.
> So I think the camera could use some more feedback. Obviously, there's no sound in here right now, for the Explorer.
> It's pretty tricky to create the sound for it. But you know, we're working on it. We'll get there.
