### Transcript

> i don't think about the situation that
>
> many only build platforms in the sky
>
> is that uh is that what you want in
>
> terms of map design
>
> um yes and no yeah
>
> i mean we want people to build however
>
> they want and if people feel like it's a
>
> necessity to like have to build up
>
> way high in this guy yeah but i don't
>
> know it's like pretty
>
> it's an interesting question right
>
> because like from a game design point of
>
> view it's like okay people are doing
>
> that but is that the game we wanted to
>
> make kind of thing
>
> yeah i don't know like when i started
>
> playing the game
>
> that was one of the first things i
>
> wanted to do i was like i want to build
>
> something in the sky like a big platform
>
> situation right then when you play more
>
> of it you're like that's kind of cool to
>
> like try and figure out how to
>
> get it working so like it really depends
>
> on how
>
> you want your base to work like
>
> yeah yeah but it is an interesting
>
> aspect yeah i don't think it's something
>
> that we're gonna i don't think it's
>
> something we're gonna try and tackle
>
> though
>
> no i think it's a whether it's a problem
>
> or not i don't think it's something we
>
> want to address
>
> um yeah you know we we have played with
>
> the idea of um
>
> like structural support and stuff like
>
> that and we even had a prototype with it
>
> for it a few quite a few years ago and
>
> uh decided that
>
> uh we didn't want it so for whatever the
>
> reasons were whether we didn't like the
>
> idea of it
>
> or if it was too hard or whatever i
>
> can't remember
>
> if anything it's definitely a
>
> performance thing like
>
> yeah like like holy [ __ ]
>
> like that that would affect so much it
>
> would have affected like how the game
>
> would have been designed
>
> i assume yeah it would be a completely
>
> different game
