>
> takes a lot of consideration it doesn't
>
> matter how big or small it is yeah
>

>

>
> reverting all that stuff is such a pain
>
> in the ass
>
> so we're really careful when when we do
>
> make
>
> new patches that to make sure that we're
>

>
> um and it's just too much effort it's
>
> just like it's part of maintaining the
>
> game
>
> that just takes a lot of time and like
>
> merging and
>
> getting the stuff that's supposed to be
>
