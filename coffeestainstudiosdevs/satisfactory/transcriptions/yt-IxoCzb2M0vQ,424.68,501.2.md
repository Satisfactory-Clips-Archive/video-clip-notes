> Okay, so the Train is really cool,
> you can build tracks really far,
> so you can use the trains to cross the map yourself quickly, because you can drive it.
> But, it's also a nice way to automate resources to be delivered.
> The trains are really fast as well. So I'm not going remotely as fast as it can go.
> Because it's gonna go super super fast.
> So yeah, it's pretty nice.
> Now you can automate them as well, and I'll show you how that works.
> Uh, so first of all, I'll just go to a train station.
> So here's one that's right there, and then there's another one on the other side.
> So there's 'Stenstorp'. I pressed 'Q' to open that up, same is automating vehicles.
> We can add 'Stenstorp' and we can add 'Skoevde' to it
> We can change, how long we want it to stay there, at the stop.
> Let's do five seconds. Cool, and then I'll just jump out, and it will do its thing.
> So there's the next station, it's, where is it?
> Alright, so here's the next station. The train's pulling up.
> It's a little shaky.
> Yep, so there you go.
