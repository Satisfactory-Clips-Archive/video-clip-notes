### Transcript

> vernaculon will achievements ever be created they will be they will be uh there will be achievements for the game but we don't want to do them too soon we're probably going to do them with 1.0 or something like that we don't want to do them too soon because we wanted to you know we didn't want to we didn't want to like when thinking about how we want to rebalance the game or something like that we don't want to think about oh but we don't want to break the achievements that we have or the achievements we already have need to continue to exist and be balanced correctly and have that affect the game's design and direction that doesn't make much sense so we're we're kind of just waiting until uh uh the game is you know in in a place where it makes sense to uh create the g uh achievements like good achievements that will um okay so it makes sense forever
