> and yeah so serious question how will we
> 
> cross play i don't actually know the
> 
> inside's announced yet
> 
> um yeah i don't
> 
> i don't know do you know uh i mean we i
> 
> know what we're shooting for
> 
> but we're still kind of like figuring
> 
> out
> 
> what works and what doesn't um it's both
> 
> like
> 
> in terms of what is supported in in each
> 
> api
> 
> because epic has really good support
> 
> when it comes to like
> 
> interlocking with steam um
> 
> so but it all comes down to like okay
> 
> it's also aspect as to like okay but
> 
> what's the easiest way
> 
> for someone who wants to play with steam
> 
> friends like is it easier to connect
> 
> with steam on my end or is it easier if
> 
> they log in like with an epic account or
> 
> like all these different questions
> 
> that comes up with like ux and and that
> 
> is one aspect
> 
> and as i mentioned before that technical
> 
> actually like implementing the api is
> 
> another thing
> 
> and all these like different steam
> 
> features that exist um
> 
> with like cloud saves and blah blah blah
> 
> blah for on on steam send because we
> 
> have to like strip
> 
> the different versions and it's also
> 
> internally a big thing for us to be able
> 
> to like
> 
> because we have a build machine that
> 
> automatic like we essentially push
> 
> push a switch and it builds a certain
> 
> version of the game for us
> 
> and and it pushes it to like the server
> 
> that can distribute it
> 
> via epic and blah blah blah and we also
> 
> need to do a bunch of work so that we
> 
> can be like
> 
> okay build the steam version build the
> 
> epic version
> 
> and that's supposed to be like okay i'm
> 
> gonna strip out all the epic stuff from
> 
> the epic version i'm gonna strip out the
> 
> steam
> 
> stuff from the epic verse did i say the
> 
> wrong way whatever
> 
> so you get the right version as well
> 
> when you're building in that
> 
> configuration and whatnot
> 
> so that's also a big big
> 
> part of why it's taking long like
> 
> why it's taking time is actually because
> 
> that needs to be in place for us
> 
> before we can actually start rolling out
> 
> anything uh
> 
> so yeah lengthy answer to i guess uh
> 
> fairly easy
> 
> but it's informative yeah
