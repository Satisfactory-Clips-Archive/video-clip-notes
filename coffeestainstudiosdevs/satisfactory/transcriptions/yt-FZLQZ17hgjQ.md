### Transcript

> there you are
>
> there you go so that was the e.t sequel
>
> was weird
>
> yeah so that's that's that's the one and
>
> and i've i've been so happy
>
> reading like all these threads about
>
> like how
>
> you know what what exactly is being
>
> showcased here
>
> so today we're gonna actually [ __ ]
>
> debunk all of it
>
> and disappoint so many people uh because
>
> people read into this way too much
>
> in certain aspects it's it's great
>
> because it gives you gives us clues as
>
> to uh what people want
>
> yeah it's really fun it's really fun to
>
> see all that stuff yeah
>
> and a lot of the time when we we we're a
>
> little vague or we
>
> hide little features in there it's
>
> specifically because we love seeing
>
> the like the conspiracy theories and the
>
> you know the
>
> the it's really really fun yes and and
>
> partly
>
> so i've intentionally built this like
>
> place base whatever intentionally kind
>
> of weird
>
> just because i wanted to see this type
>
> of discussion
>
> um so there are a few cases where like
>
> i've clipped power lines through the
>
> buildings and whatnot just to make it
>
> look like
>
> and it's not to be like mean or anything
>
> i just think it's funny to do that
>
> because people figured it out
>
> like people have like i've legit seen
>
> people that figure that [ __ ] out
>
> so that's impressive okay so the the
>
> main things that we're showcasing
>
> in this video are the jump pads and the
>
> new jumpers are
>
> awesome like the the old ones you had to
>
> like place them and then kind of jump
>
> and like try and
>
> like try it out and like die until you
>
> figured out
>
> we showcased that on our stream last
>
> week with jace
>
> [ __ ] working on the jump at his own
>
> base
>
> um yeah
>
> and it was so like frustrating because
>
> we were doing that i just sit in there
>
> like
>
> ah jays you know like this is so easy in
>
> the new they're the new gym
>
> so now we have like video evidence of
>
> like this is what like it's kind of like
>
> you know
>
> tv like infomercials where it's like
>
> before and after
>
> yeah so you kind of have that so you
>
> gotta you gotta grab that from the
>
> stream like play it black and white
>
> and then showcase that teaser after that
>
> um so it's way easier now you get to see
>
> like the the
>
> the jump segmentations uh one caveat
>
> with that is that
>
> uh so we don't have deterministic
>
> physics in the game
>
> so we can't like would 100 accuracy say
>
> like this is
>
> exactly what's going to happen in the
>
> simulation that's coming
>
> well smith has just written that the old
>
> ones doesn't even hit the same place 10
>
> out of 10 times
>
> yeah like so this yeah these things are
>
> going to be more of like a guideline
>
> yeah but but they are way better like
>
> they are more predictive
>
> i don't know exactly what we've changed
>
> in that department but
>
> i've like jumped on them back and forth
>
> and they pretty much worked like
>
> almost every single time um there are a
>
> few cases where like you need to do a
>
> little bit of guiding
>
> when you're jumping on it but it's like
>
> it's way better
>
> um one thing that i'm kind of hoping
>
> that we'll be able to get in for the
>
> update that's not
>
> in the current build i believe is that
>
> like so it's like segmented
>
> segmented like so when you're scrolling
>
> it like jumps
>
> um i would like to have so that's it's
>
> also like stepless
>
> uh so it gives you a little bit more
>
> freedom
>
> because sometimes when you're like
>
> different heights and it's like
>
> it's divided so if you're building on a
>
> foundation grid you're kind of locked in
>
> the grid
>
> uh which made that demo or like that
>
> save file that i worked on a little bit
>
> tricky
>
> uh because sometimes it wouldn't fit
>
> like the distance so i would have to
>
> like re
>
> rebuild it but hopefully we're gonna
>
> we're gonna fix that so that that won't
>
> be an issue
>
> uh and one thing that i didn't showcase
>
> in this in the teaser is that you can
>
> angle them
>
> way more now like you can almost make a
>
> wall
>
> um and one thing that i also didn't
>
> showcase in the teaser is
>
> is you can also place them on [ __ ]
>
> ceilings and walls
>
> which i didn't know when i made the
>
> teaser and i wish i did
>
> because i would wanted to make it like
>
> walls sorry the jump pads
>
> you can place the jump pads on ceilings
>
> and walls and [ __ ]
>
> really yeah which i didn't think of
>
> trying
>
> um i i hope that's true but that's what
>
> they that's what the developer told me
>
> who made it
>
> um so i wish i'd made like a
>
> like a room with just jump pads and just
>
> walk into and just [ __ ] fling around
>
> [Laughter]
>
> so that's something that community can
>
> can do uh first one to do it
>
> gets it's a cookie or something um
>
> so that's pretty dope i'm looking
>
> forward to that i gotta try that out
>
> that on the ceiling will be so useful
>
> i remember maybe you couldn't place it
>
> on ceiling but for sure for sure for
>
> walls
>
> that's great that's really good yeah so
>
> that's pretty cool um
>
> and yeah like you can also angle them
>
> way more so like the the
>
> you can almost angle them like
>
> completely 90 degrees vertically
>
> so um it was kind of hard to showcase it
>
> but if you if you have like jumps where
>
> you land on the side of it
>
> you can just like straight bounce
>
> straight back out um
>
> so so there's like they're way more you
>
> can do way more with them essentially
>
> and i think people would use them more
>
> because i think like when when we
>
> introduced hyper tubes people like
>
> stopped using the jump pads but now i
>
> think
>
> it'll be much better yeah a pinball
>
> machine somebody needs to make like a
>
> pinball
>
> ping-pong room oh good now i can hit
>
> rock bottom even faster
>
> so i don't know if you can place uh the
>
> jelly
>
> mats on walls
>
> as well but somebody wants to try that
>
> yeah something to try someone saying
>
> aerial faith play exactly same as portal
>
> basically and uh yeah the jump pads and
>
> all the teasers that we've been putting
>
> out are for this coming update
>
> at like the end of the month yes um so
>
> it's not update 4. update 4 is next year
>
> beginning of next year
>
> so so jumping on the next feature that
>
> we also showcased
>
> in this teaser was the fact that when
>
> you're pulling
>
> uh wires now from stuff and you aim at
>
> walls and ceilings it will automatically
>
> switch
>
> from the power poles to you know
>
> whatever
>
> mount that you need so if you're aiming
>
> at the wall it will automatically create
>
> a
>
> regular mark one wall mount
>
> and if you aim it at the ceiling like
>
> you show you can see in the trailer
>
> um it will mount it to the ceiling i'll
>
> play the trailer again at the end of
>
> this section for
>
> for those of you who are hearing this
>
> stuff but didn't notice it in the
>
> trailer
>
> and also there's some people who showed
>
> up who didn't see the trailer just you
>
> know they just showed up now
>
> so we'll talk more about all these
>
> features and then we'll play the trailer
>
> again so you can look for it
>
> yes can you have like it running while
>
> we're talking about it
>
> if you open like youtube
>
> so yeah so it automatically switches uh
>
> one thing
>
> so we're not introducing powered walls
>
> which a lot of people really thought we
>
> were
>
> um and people were pointing out that
>
> like when i aimed at like
>
> certain of the the the power connectors
>
> it would show like one out of
>
> zero out of four connectors so we're
>
> like how do you getting how are you
>
> getting power
>
> the thing with like the double mounted
>
> wall thingamajigs is that
>
> they will only showcase one side so they
>
> were connected on the other side and
>
> they will feed electricity through
>
> which they do already um so that's why
>
> it looked like
>
> the walls were powered but they were in
>
> fact not and some people noticed that
>
> and some people
>
> uh didn't i got it working by the way
>
> oh [ __ ] nice
>
> uh but yeah it switches automatically so
>
> like there's way less
>
> less like switching in the build menu
>
> which is
>
> super nice uh one thing also with the
>
> jump pads that some people noticed is
>
> that it doesn't automatically
>
> like immediately swing me and that's
>
> already in the game it's when you
>
> build it it will run the build effect
>
> and then once that's done
>
> then the jump at it becomes active so
>
> that's why
>
> it didn't like shoot me off immediately
>
> i saw a lot of people thought that like
>
> either you had like more control over
>
> that but no it's still automatic
>
> um and yeah like the [ __ ] move
>
> it's beautiful uh another thing that
>
> people uh
>
> noticed so by the way this moon is
>
> already in the game i know a lot of
>
> people saw like oh are you adding a new
>
> moon to the game it's like no it's
>
> already in the game this is this is just
>
> an et reference
>
> yeah there's an et reference that's all
>
> it is uh it's not the actual moon
>
> because the actual moon is way smaller
>
> and it moves
>
> like above the skyline so what that
>
> actually is one of the like
>
> interest one of the developers were sure
>
> to point this out to me when we talked
>
> about it because he's like that's not a
>
> moon
>
> you dummy um but it's one of the planets
>
> there's like two or three planets that
>
> are like
>
> turning around or like rotating around
>
> massage uh uh bb
>
> 2ab um so it's one of those and like
>
> during certain times of night it will
>
> turn like white
>
> what's the suspicious building in the
>
> distance a lot of people have been
>
> talking about this
>
> oh yeah yeah yeah you have an image of
>
> that somewhere i can let's say that
>
> let's say that
>
> i think yeah yeah yeah uh i can i think
>
> i think i think i can find the image for
>
> you though
>
> i think i sent it to you
>
> so yeah so no no uh wall mount
>
> uh sorry no powered walls and uh one
>
> other thing that people
>
> pointed out is that knight seems to be
>
> brighter which is also i guess a little
>
> bit unfortunate because
>
> it's probably because of the capture
>
> quality and we caught it because it we
>
> haven't really done anything
>
> with night we are gonna do something
>
> with the
>
> like night being too too dark and like i
>
> think it's also pretty
>
> one thing that's pretty good to notice
>
> is this as well a lot of people thought
>
> this was way better
>
> and that just gives to show that like
>
> the problem is
>
> like that there's still stuff we can do
>
> with knight to make it better
>
> like it and i i've noticed this a lot
>
> when i played gosu tsushima
>
> recently tsushima um
>
> where like night time is way better in
>
> that game so it really is like a
>
> i think it's more of a gamma thing or
>
> like and we also don't have that setting
>
> in the game which also makes it harder
>
> um so but that's unfortunately not in
>
> the fluid update
>
> um it just happened to look like it
>
> uh what else yeah so let's talk about
>
> that uh that secret building in the
>
> background
>
> right i just got it in time hey i'm
>
> giving you one
>
> so we i think we're good give me one
>
> second here
>
> oh geez that's not a that's not a what
>
> are you what are you showing me oh my
>
> god jase put on some pants oh my
>
> god wow jason
>
> i'm not pulling a tubing right
>
> [Laughter]
>
> um uh this is taking a little longer
>
> than
>
> expected oh yeah and one more thing that
>
> i noticed uh
>
> that's also kind of unfortunate so the
>
> the power poles in the background
>
> there's like we're using i'm using the
>
> mark iii power poles
>
> there's apparently some kind of like
>
> graphical issue on that build
>
> i was running that like rendered some
>
> kind of weird box
>
> i don't know why that happened
>
> and i didn't even notice it when i was
>
> making it but yeah they wanted to point
>
> that out
>
> me they wanted me to point that out as
>
> well that that's kind of odd
>
> and that's not supposed to be there um
>
> a lot of people were like speculating
>
> about it but no one i really
>
> like had anything like what could this
>
> be used for it's just like a glitch
>
> unfortunately okay so uh
>
> yeah all right here i'm gonna bring in
>
> the uh secret
>
> building this is the suspicious building
>
> the secret building that people have
>
> been talking about
>
> yeah new building question mark in the
>
> distance
>
> what is that hmm all right let's just
>
> see if i can zoom in a little here
>
> yeah [ __ ] it how hard can you zoom in
>
> angry windows noises can you see it you
>
> guys can you see it
>
> what is that in the distance so that was
>
> not intentional
>
> for one thing yeah that was that wasn't
>
> intentional to be in that save i didn't
>
> even
>
> enhance more nice pixels yeah yeah i
>
> know the image is small
>
> so i can say one thing about that this
>
> is the same as a ufo sighting you guys
>
> like this is about the same quality here
>
> look yeah
>
> i can say one thing about that is that
>
> that's part of
>
> this week's teaser that whole like
>
> yeah uh maybe not
>
> yeah i don't know how how far i'll go
>
> but that cis coffee state edition
>
> twilight theme that bigfoot is that the
>
> real bigfoot
>
> yep um
>
> so so yeah like that tube in the corner
>
> that's that building is
>
> part of next this week's teaser it's not
>
> done though
>
> the gray thing yeah the great thing all
>
> right so i'm putting the gray thing in
>
> the middle right now okay see that
>
> on the corner
>
> this is this is the top quality stream
>
> you all joined in for
>
> i mean i mean this feels like a
>
> conspiracy theory stream right now
>
> i mean it is i mean it is and we're
>
> fueling the fire let's do it
>
> look guys look so so that's the start
>
> of me starting to build this
>
> can you guys see this is this is what
>
> they don't want you to know
>
> right yeah and to the left
>
> back and to the left i'm gonna i'm gonna
>
> switch back to us now okay yeah do it
>
> wait that's not right hang on a second
>
> put on some pants dude
>
> [Music]
>
> oh don't tell me what to do there i
>
> think we're good
>
> yeah i think we're good so that was not
>
> yeah so that building was not
>
> intentional to be there like that was me
>
> starting to work on it and then i was
>
> like oh [ __ ] i have to do this first
>
> [Laughter]
>
> how big is it i don't even know what
>
> that thing was i it's
>
> no it's a yeah smith's working on the
>
> video someone else before when's the
>
> next teaser we
>
> put out videos every thursday so the
>
> teasers are um
>
> um they're they're taking the thursday
>
> slot of the the regular schedule so
>
> it'll be out there on on thursday so in
>
> two days
>
> and it's going to be hype and we're
>
> going to have the teaser
>
> done early so we might get firmier on
>
> youtube to see how that works out
>
> first it might be done today um
>
> we'll see and we could give it to you
>
> soon but we're not
>
> gonna
>
> um what's gonna say
>
> it looked like a tractor was a really
>
> big tractor
>
> it's not a tractor i can tell you that
>
> much
>
> yeah so so so one thing also a lot of
>
> people were supposed to
>
> butcher sorry about this this week was
>
> also that power
>
> like everything is powered with uh with
>
> um
>
> biomass generators i promise everything
>
> is powered by biomass generators but
>
> there are a few lines that aren't
>
> connected
>
> oh and i've i've
>
> i don't know if i can oh [ __ ] i don't
>
> know if i can maybe we can showcase it
>
> uh
>
> after the next teaser goes out because i
>
> don't want to do it this week
>
> uh but everything like it's it's a valid
>
> save but it's a bit funny because i've
>
> placed
>
> biomass generators inside every single
>
> building that you
>
> can and cannot see um and i've clipped
>
> all the power lines
>
> so one thing that people fail to notice
>
> in the video was that
>
> power also comes through the train
>
> station
>
> so what i've done is i've pulled power
>
> from that like glass box all the way
>
> through the map
>
> to like a train station that's way in
>
> the distance
>
> and then i have the train station come
>
> back to that train station
>
> and that's what's powering all those
>
> like uh
>
> well snoop got really bored making this
>
> video yeah
>
> it was actually kind of out of necessity
>
> because i was like [ __ ] i don't
>
> like when i was jumping around i like
>
> didn't have power
>
> after i built it so i died a couple of
>
> times and i was like [ __ ] and i just
>
> pull power from the nearest
>
> like whatever i found so it's a bit
>
> messy
>
> uh so what what what did we mess up what
>
> was that included
>
> so yeah okay so the sitting down thing
>
> yeah
>
> like that so that's apparently not
>
> coming in this fluid update that's
>
> that's me messing up because the way we
>
> created these builds was like i kind of
>
> like
>
> threw [ __ ] together in my own custom
>
> build to be able to showcase some of
>
> this stuff
>
> because it wasn't ready when i was
>
> making the video um
>
> but now it is and that happened to bring
>
> in some stuff that's like
>
> not at all part of this update but it's
>
> coming for update four and one of those
>
> things were
>
> that sitting down thing and it's not an
>
> emote unfortunately a lot of people were
>
> guessing that it's an emote
>
> um it's actually when you're afk so when
>
> you
>
> leave the session instead of just having
>
> the pioneers standing around
>
> looking like a doofus it will she will
>
> sit down and have a cup of
>
> uh nutmeg coffee not make coffee
>
> but but but a lot of people are like you
>
> guys were really hyped for for being
>
> uh an emote so i don't know like maybe i
>
> don't know
>
> i'm just saying maybe we should take
>
> that and do it
>
> yeah and uh see what we can do about
>
> that but that's that's coming
>
> later down the line that's that's that's
>
> so you got a little sneak peek of
>
> something in update for right i guess
>
> this is something that might help with
>
> when
>
> when people see like uh have that bug
>
> where they see a clone of themselves
>
> when they rejoin the game
>
> must be really jarring just seeing a
>
> character standing there
>
> yeah right but if it's sitting it might
>
> give you a bit more of an idea of like
>
> okay something
>
> is like i don't know rather
>
> a random model is here it's like oh yeah
>
> exactly it helps
>
> yeah it also helps like when people are
>
> literally afk
>
> and they're just standing around so you
>
> can differentiate between who's like
>
> not in the session and who's actually in
>
> the game but they're not playing
>
> right yeah right or like in the session
>
> and that will
>
> also that's also something for like
>
> dedicated servers because it makes it
>
> way more
>
> like uh clear on who's actually playing
>
> and who's not
>
> with that and it's pretty cute and it's
>
> yeah
>
> and that's that's that's everything in
>
> the teaser that yeah
>
> debunked all of it and after
>
> the update is not coming like that's
>
> that's that's the noun
>
> or is it where is it i think we're
>
> actually going to be on time
>
> this time it's pretty good yeah yeah
>
> exactly now users will be able to tell
>
> themselves from like the phantom
>
> exactly exactly well i guess you could
>
> always tell yourself from them but
>
> now you've got some idea of what's going
>
> on and hopefully
>
> also for update four will have some kind
>
> of
>
> workaround or a fix for that issue with
>
> having when you're playing offline
>
> having like pioneers
>
> spawning ran up randomly and stuff like
>
> that
