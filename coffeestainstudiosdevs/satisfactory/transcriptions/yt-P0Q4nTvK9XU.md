### Transcript

> uh will update4 include multiplayer
>
> optimization yes
>
> multi like multiplayer optimization
>
> happens all the time like we're always
>
> working on
>
> on optimizing multiplayer um i before i
>
> was
>
> a community manager i did nothing but
>
> optimize
>
> for multiplayer and it's it's one of
>
> those things for like unfortunately you
>
> don't really
>
> like unfortunately the way
>
> it currently works because where you're
>
> you have someone who's hosting the game
>
> right
>
> unfortunately the way it works the best
>
> network optimizations in when we
>
> optimize
>
> like the game itself so
>
> um what's happening
>
> in most cases for people when you have
>
> big factories is that
>
> it your your computer like needs to
>
> spend so many resources just
>
> running the game for you and also
>
> hosting for other people
>
> is like is like playing like a different
>
> game at the same time almost
>
> uh not really but like that's a
>
> simplification
>
> um so you know the better the game
>
> itself runs
>
> the better networking runs or or
>
> syncing stuff like the less desync
>
> issues you'll have
>
> um so we
>
> we're always working on optimization we
>
> have a running like
>
> system that checks every single day how
>
> we're doing on that
>
> uh we're always working on network
>
> optimization being it
>
> uh either optimizing the like being it
>
> benefits from optimizing the game
>
> or you know actual like networking
>
> tricks um
>
> that we need to make uh there there are
>
> like systems we can implement to make it
>
> better
>
> there are also systems we need to
>
> replace to make it better
>
> um but yeah like we're always working on
>
> that and that's
>
> i believe we are going to be releasing
>
> those as patches
>
> that's not tied into update 4
>
> specifically so it's not like we're
>
> going to hold out
>
> on you know optimization stuff before
>
> update 4. we're going to want to roll
>
> that out
>
> as much as we can and that is because
>
> like sometimes we
>
> those optimizations break things and
>
> we'd rather you know
>
> put that on the experimental branch way
>
> ahead and then realize oh
>
> didn't work fix it up and then once
>
> we have content
>
> we'll release that as update 4 and then
>
> we won't have as many issues
>
> you know so that's pretty much how we do
>
> things right now
>
> so no optimization and network fixes
>
> will come
>
> when when we're done with those systems
>
> when we've implemented those fixes and
>
> systems it may not affect everyone
>
> because
>
> all these network issues that people are
>
> having uh
>
> they're very like the root cause for
>
> them is very different
>
> um like there are so many different
>
> scenarios
>
> as to why people are running into
>
> different issues
>
> the but like the main one is just that
>
> the game is so
>
> performance intense and that slows down
>
> the it doesn't really slow down the tick
>
> rate of the game but
>
> it really affects the tick rate and that
>
> causes a lot of desync issues
>
> um that's a simplification of
>
> there's so many reasons why like
>
> networking is hard guys holy
>
> um and uh yeah i mentioned before about
>
> dedicated service dedicated service is
>
> supposed
>
> like we're focusing that right now
>
> hopefully we'll launch that before
>
> update 4.
