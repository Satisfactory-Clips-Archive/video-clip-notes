> 
> [ __ ] yeah but that's what i mean but it
>

> 
> were also okay with it
> 
> i'm not gonna lie yeah we're all like
> 
> that'll be kind of funny yeah
> 
> uh so i gotta be honest there um but
> 
> that's what i mean with like we were
> 
> aware of
> 
> yeah that's probably we were aware of it
> 
> but yeah yeah but we did it anyways
> 
> because
> 
> do it for the yolo they you go the micro
> 
> transaction counter
> 
> three all right let's keep that up for
> 
> the rest of the stream yeah um
> 
> so yeah it's an actual feature and the
> 
> reason why we didn't like immediately
> 
> announce that like no no no it's not
> 
> micro transactions
> 
> is because we kind of just like yeah i
> 
> mean
> 
> it was sort of interesting to see what
> 
> happens because whilst there was that
> 
> talk of microtransactions
> 
> and it's quite easy to put like negative
> 
> feedback at the forefront of your mind
> 
> the vast majority of people
> 
> either didn't care or were excited for
> 
> something or were guessing that it was
> 
> some kind of in-game coupon or
> 
> in-game currency thing or whatever
> 
> right um so so like you know when we
> 
> just left that discussion
> 
> going and looking at it from a high
> 
> level uh
> 
> it was honestly pretty interesting um
> 
> and also we're like trolls so we kind of
> 
> liked it
> 
> when some people got it wrong and not
> 
> just the micro transactions but other
> 
> things too
> 
> so um but honestly like a big part
> 
> for us at least a big part of like
> 
> seeing all the discussions that are
> 
> happening
> 
> i like it you're keeping it up three um
> 
> to be honest like
> 
> i i at least i really love seeing all
> 
> the discussion around it like what it
> 
> could be and what it can't be and like
> 
> why is it feasible
> 
> like why do people think it's micro
> 
> transactions like why would that make
> 
> sense for some people
> 
> and stuff like that um but
> 
> and and one thing that i that i
> 
> remembered um
> 
> when we put this at is the fact that
> 
> we've said in the past
> 
> that we're not gonna have micro
> 
> transactions if you don't remember what
> 
> that looked like
> 
> it looked like this micro transactions
> 
> will not be in the game nor will loot
> 
> boxes will not be in the game
> 
> not be in the game micro transactions
> 
> transactions
> 
> will not will not will not be in the
> 
> game
> 
> loot boxes loot boxes boot boxes
> 
> micro transactions
> 
> so that was a [ __ ] lie
> 
> the counter is like flying up here they
> 
> were 14 now
> 
> 69 this is the rest of the street but
> 
> however okay so like you know okay so
> 
> the first thing that came to my mind is
> 
> like
> 
> hey did you know that games can have a
> 
> shop in it and not have minecraft
> 
> transactions
> 
> it's an age-old thing but one we even
> 
> said that but we also do have a track
> 
> record of
> 
> trolling but also things have also
> 
> changed against what we've said before
> 
> and
> 
> the whole steam epic thing is one
> 
> example of that um
> 
> so it's it's not unfounded that folks
> 
> would would
> 
> could dismiss that we've said not no
> 
> microtransactions and the other thing is
> 
> if that's people's first sort of go-to
> 
> thing i think that's also a bit of like
> 
> commentary on maybe what people's
> 
> expectations are when they see a shop
> 
> and maybe that's something industry-wide
> 
> as well so i think there are a lot of
> 
> reasons why people were thinking about
> 
> microtransactions and like don't get us
> 
> wrong like we understand
> 
> that people like could make like come up
> 
> with that idea it's not that like people
> 
> are stupid or anything like that
> 
> some people are but it's got nothing to
> 
> do with this
> 
> no it's it's it's it's like reasonable
> 
> in today's climate i guess
> 
> yeah yeah i guess so and also no no
> 
> shade to folks who do use
> 
> microtransactions uh i think
> 
> microtransactions
> 
> let's get that number up boys
> 
> microtransactions
> 
> uh can can be done well implemented well
> 
> in specific contexts i think that's fine
> 
> but we've also all seen
> 
> uh microtransactions used in less than
> 
> ideal ways
> 
> for sure yeah just
>
