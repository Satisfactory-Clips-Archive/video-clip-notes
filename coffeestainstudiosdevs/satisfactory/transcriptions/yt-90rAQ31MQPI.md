> game finally yes yes one thing
>
> that i think is really that we haven't
>
> talked about is
>
> so we've had an issue in the game for a
>
> long time and and we've kind of like
>
> had to we've kind of decided to be that
>
> way
>
> and that's the thing where if you like
>
> play offline or if you get disconnected
>
> or if you join in
>
> and you're not logged in on whatever
>
> then you'll spawn in as a different pawn
>
> right
>
> and for the that necessity of like
>
> if you can't authenticate and you log in
>
> like we we
>
> connect the the player in the game with
>
> your kind of epic
>
> was it the epic id we used before or it
>
> was a combination of
>
> what's called a product user id and epic
>
> id yeah
>
> so so like if you're playing offline you
>
> lose that information and then when you
>
> join in you don't know like which player
>
> is who like
>
> um so so that's been kind of a thing
>
> that's been in the game for a long time
>
> uh and i don't know if have we done
>
> anything
>
> to to make that process better or in in
>
> this version or
>
> we have done some things with it i
>
> it wasn't me doing that so i can't
>
> say for sure and i at once i haven't
>
> been able to test
>
> multi playing multiplayer in that kind
>
> of like
>
> sense much my own myself so i haven't
>
> been able to see the effects of it
>
> but our goal were to be able to like
>
> when you cross play and you play
>
> one pawn or like it's called a player
>
> it's called the pawn
>
> that's just under the surface in the
>
> code it's called pawn uh when you're
>
> playing one pawn
>
> uh in one on one platform and then you
>
> go to another platform and play and or
>
> something like that you you want to be
>
> the same player
>
> and we did some work with that but i
>
> don't know exact results of it
>
> and in when working on that we talked
>
> about solutions for solving the offline
>
> stuff as well but
>
> i actually don't know if we did what we
>
> did because we have
>
> implemented it when we when i migrated
>
> the save system
>
> to cache your last logged in epic
>
> id or something like that so that and
>
> that could have been used to like
>
> when you're playing offline be like oh
>
> but you were last login with this
>
> product id and blah blah so i can hook
>
> you up uh and and another solution that
>
> we've talked about as
>
> i said i'm not saying this is gonna
>
> maybe necessarily be in the game but
>
> one discussion we've had is to like have
>
> some kind of like when you're joining be
>
> able to select which player you want to
>
> play as maybe manually or something like
>
> that
>
> um because you know that will never fail
>
> in the sense that you're lost but but
>
> then you'll also get the issue like if
>
> you
>
> use someone else to save you can be like
>
> quote unquote safe scum and like place
>
> one pawn in one end of the
>
> in the world and then save and then
>
> reload and then join us another player
>
> somewhere else and stuff like that
>
> and kind of make a transportation system
>
> by that
>
> so like sounds good yeah let's do it
>
> um so like there there
>
> that's that's one thing that we've for
>
> the longest time been wanting to fix
>
> and do something about and i think i
>
> think this system also
>
> is a big like step as to like more tools
>
> we can use to
>
> to make that system better as well yeah
>
