>
> but it will come i think we'll also talk
>
> do you i think impossible
>
> but it's coming you you guys will get it
>
> you guys will get it it's not that high
>
> right now prior to this a lot of people
>
> request it like
>
> totally get it but again like we have to
>
> balance
>
> what you guys want with the development
>
> of the game
>
> right so like we we have that
>
> responsibility to finish the game
>
> and to make the entire game as good as
>
> it can be and so
>
> while uh creative mode will definitely
>
> add
>
> value in terms of people want a
>
> different mode
>
> it doesn't actually give us it or it may
>
> it might but it probably won't give us
>
> it's not going to push us forward in
>
> development
>
> um the game won't be closer to being
>
> finished uh but but it might still be a
>
> good thing but but
>
> we will add it but it's also it's like
>
> it's also a big aspect for us
>
> where uh we're kind of like
>
> seeing how people play the game and like
>
> tracking how people play like how
>
> balancing works right now
>
> and we we'd kind of like get like fiddle
>
> data if if we start adding
>
> creative mode where like you can build
>
> whatever and then we don't know like is
>
> the pacing good in the game or not like
>
> everybody keeps switching what
>
> if people just keep switching to
>
> creative mode because the field is too
>
> much of a churn
>
> and we're just like but we don't want it
>
> to be a churn we want
>
> the balance to be good your feedback
>
> yeah we need your feedback on that so if
>
> everybody
>
> keeps switching over to creative mode or
>
> like halfway more blah blah then it's
>
> going to be harder for us to do that
>
> balancing so i think like in terms of
>
> creative mode it's probably going to be
>
> something that we add when we we feel
>
> like okay
>
> now we think that the the balance is
>
> good enough
>
> so we can let people do whatever they
>
> want and
>
> we we can still get the feedback we need
>
> but we feel like we're in a good enough
>
> state so it doesn't really matter if we
>
> get
>
> dirty data or like messy data or
>
> whatever from people
>
> dirty data boy um
>
> someone's asking creative what question
>
> mark i'm assuming you don't know what
>
> uh creative mode is and essentially it's
>
> just
>
> uh free cheats you have everything
>
> uh it's all free i get yeah that's
>
> pretty much
