> like
> a few foundations here right so i'm
> going to place like one
> whoops i [ __ ] that up oh it went

> way to like
> do uh similar to what a reaction mod
> does where like you can select an area
> but maybe that's something that's coming
> or maybe you can already do that and i
> just haven't figured it out yet
