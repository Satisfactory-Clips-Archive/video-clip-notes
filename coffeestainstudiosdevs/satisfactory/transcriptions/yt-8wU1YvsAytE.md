> uh rechargeable batteries i've seen this uh a few times actually people have been uh talking about the way we use like the packaging thing where like you can reuse the containers like a similar thing with batteries if you could like recharge them or something like that yeah i wanted that as well man oh cool but then all these other designs were like not marked

> that's not that's literally what goes down here this is a cool thing nah mark this is sad yeah yeah i had this whole concept for the problem was that it was it was quite complex i think to potentially use and it was hard to convince other people of on the team of the necessity for it because what i was quite interested in is having a building as well that could use them as power so you could transport batteries to outposts and power them that way rather than rather than having to package fuel which is probably what most players do now if they want to power an outpost remotely without having to build other power lines especially because we had the drones uh coming in i was like that's gonna be dope you can just power an entire outpost we're just sending some batteries with a drone to that location and uh do it that way and then you get the things the empty batteries back you sent them back you charged them up again with the main grid and then you sent them back and forth that way uh seemed like fun seeing it still kind of seems like fun to me the problem is that like new building how do you charge them do they just go into constructor that's not a really good way because of the the constructor doesn't use enough power for that mark you just make a building that has solar panels on it yeah but then we need a new building that's always kind of the problem right like there's enough cool stuff to add but there's so much effort so much work that goes into actually creating that content which is usually the the main limiter it's like yeah we want this but we can't do it that easily so priority comes in and kicks certain things out of the window yeah let's see how it is i'm kind of happy when i set up my first drone path thing the route for drones was that you can totally use the batteries within the drones themselves to use like a self-sustaining in in other drone ports you don't need to like have a battery set up on every single drone port for it to work on the topic of batteries but um recharging with sulfuric acid that's pretty good
