> hey everyone my name is jason i'm the
> 
> other community manager at coffee stain
> 
> studios and
> 
> today i mean you've read the title of
> 
> the video you know what this is about
> 
> gases are coming to update for this is
> 
> super exciting
> 
> i'm sure a lot of you are excited to
> 
> hear this but i do want to just manage
> 
> expectations a little bit here
> 
> before your mind runs off with all
> 
> possibilities okay so first of all we
> 
> say gases are coming
> 
> but in reality only one gas is coming
> 
> more gases will come
> 
> later but this is the introduction of
> 
> gases to satisfactory so in update 4
> 
> there's only going to be one gas that's
> 
> going to come to begin with
> 
> the other thing is the gases will for
> 
> the most part just function like liquids
> 
> so they're kind of just going to they're
> 
> not going to change the game in the same
> 
> way that
> 
> liquids and pipes did in update 3. but
> 
> with gases
> 
> does come a bunch of new stuff and we
> 
> can start talking about that now
> 
> so the gas that's coming is going to be
> 
> nitrogen gas
> 
> with it will be a new resource node type
> 
> that you will extract the gas from
> 
> and you will do that via a new
> 
> extraction method so there will be three
> 
> kinds of resource welds
> 
> uh nitrogen gas of course uh but also
> 
> water and oil and the extraction method
> 
> for these will require two new buildings
> 
> uh resource well extractor and resource
> 
> well pressurizer the way this works is
> 
> you get the resource well pressurizer
> 
> you place that on a well it's going to
> 
> pressurize the well and then at various
> 
> locations in the area
> 
> the resource is going to start spewing
> 
> out of the ground hit the mic a little
> 
> bit
> 
> got a little carried away resources are
> 
> going to spew out from the from the
> 
> ground you grab your resource well
> 
> extractors
> 
> you put them on those locations and you
> 
> start uh piping whatever you have
> 
> back to wherever you need it to be and
> 
> because you can buy from all these
> 
> different locations at the same time
> 
> there's a it's a lot higher resource
> 
> output rate actually via the wells
> 
> than the traditional methods that's you
> 
> know talking more for
> 
> water and oil there now the gases like i
> 
> said would travel through pipes
> 
> you know from the resource well
> 
> extractors there is a potential change
> 
> we might make here though we're not
> 
> fully sure yet but this is our plan
> 
> we're thinking of changing
> 
> the way headlift behaves for gases in
> 
> pipes in fact
> 
> probably just removing it completely so
> 
> that you won't need pumps to move gases
> 
> around
> 
> so that maybe that makes sense let me
> 
> know what you think in the comments
> 
> below
> 
> but uh you know this even though we're
> 
> pretty close to the release of update 4
> 
> this is
> 
> still kind of like this is game dev
> 
> sometimes you still don't know the
> 
> the the concrete answer of things up
> 
> until the last minute which is sometimes
> 
> why we're vague about things
> 
> because you don't know what's going on
> 
> anyway so that's the uh the resource
> 
> well uh extraction method
> 
> the resource wells and the new gas you
> 
> might be wondering what will gases be
> 
> used for they're going to be used for
> 
> you know the creation of new parts and
> 
> stuff they're going to be tied into the
> 
> blender actually
> 
> quite a lot so if you check the uh i'll
> 
> put a link up here
> 
> we made a uh like a like a teaser video
> 
> of the blender last week that came out
> 
> on our youtube channel uh here yeah so
> 
> the so the blender is going to be
> 
> making use of the nitrogen gas and some
> 
> examples of some parts that are going to
> 
> be
> 
> the nitrogen nitrogen will be
> 
> responsible for will be the fused
> 
> modular frame this was actually teased
> 
> over
> 
> the fixmas advent current calendar some
> 
> people could get it and if you read the
> 
> description
> 
> there's kind of a teaser in there that
> 
> you know nitrogen was a thing
> 
> so yes you can use nitrogen to create
> 
> fused modular frames there'll be a
> 
> cooling system which is going to be a
> 
> new part
> 
> and there's going to be nitric acid as
> 
> well which will be responsible for
> 
> some new refinement and fuel production
> 
> processes
> 
> yeah so that's uh that's all there is
> 
> with gases for now
> 
> uh i hope this is interesting i hope you
> 
> uh like that and i'm looking forward to
> 
> it
> 
> this is going to add a little bit more
> 
> complexity of the game more parts
> 
> more things to do you guys um yeah
> 
> really excited to see what you guys
> 
> think of this so please let me know in
> 
> the comments below if you liked the
