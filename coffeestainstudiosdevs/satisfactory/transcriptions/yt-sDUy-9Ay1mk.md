### Transcript

> how do you how do you like measure
>
> complexity in that sense do you think
>
> like in terms of
>
> permutations on like when things can
>
> ramp off in like the if you see it of
>
> like a
>
> tree of paths you can take to reach
>
> each like result or how do you how do
>
> you when you say
>
> complicate like complex yeah how do you
>
> how do you measure that
>
> uh that's kind of the hard part um that
>
> kind of has to do with
>
> what i said before about like setting a
>
> vision for a recipe and what the
>
> challenge is supposed to be
>
> right um so if this challenge is
>
> supposed to be purely based on the
>
> ratios being
>
> just annoying uh then we just have to
>
> look at
>
> like what is going in and kind of skew
>
> that around right so if one recipe is
>
> making 30 per minute and i need that
>
> then i will take an amount that that
>
> other recipe requires per minute that
>
> doesn't match up with 30 at all
>
> and the more that disaligned so i tend
>
> to note down actually the ratios it's
>
> like three to eight one to two
>
> all that stuff right that you would need
>
> to get a clean setup to put everything
>
> running at a hundred percent that gives
>
> me a good baseline to see
>
> how messed up uh the ratios generally
>
> are yeah but then of course all the
>
> other stuff comes in with like okay how
>
> many different types of raw rasas do you
>
> need for this how many
>
> what is the complexity of the part going
>
> into this other part
>
> and how many do i need of that and then
>
> what is the ratio of that and what
>
> makes that then what does that create
>
> with the ratio of this other part going
>
> into the
>
> the requirements and yeah cool so it's
>
> like
>
> how how many steps you need to take in
>
> order to reach a certain
>
> like to to get an even ratio of uh
>
> of uh production i guess yeah right yeah
>
> i tend to look from 100 deficient
>
> without having to clock
>
> perspective yeah gotcha
>
> and then people are cheating he's like i
>
> just over like i do this whenever i'm
>
> setting up a line and i see like one
>
> machine and i'm not going like
>
> i'm just gonna overclock this a little
>
> bit and then
>
> but i think that's fine and that's kind
>
> of why it's there as well because
>
> sometimes she just wants something that
>
> doesn't really work that way
>
> so either you try to just figure that
>
> out and make like a bigger setup than
>
> you actually need or you just underclock
>
> it a little bit here and there and it
>
> works out as well
>
> gotcha
