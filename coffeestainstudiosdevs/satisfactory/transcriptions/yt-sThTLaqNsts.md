> 
> yeah i mean it's partly it's partly it's
> 
> a big reason why too yeah we also wanted

> but a big reason is because pipes
> 
> everything else they just screwed
> 
> everything yeah
> 
> uh all right and yeah i won't mention on
> 
> some of the ways that they
> 
> work so you can check them out
> 
> yourselves and so sometimes maybe it's a
> 
> good idea to start from the beginning
> 
> because
> 
> some of the newer stuff are introduced
> 
> earlier and may affect how you want to
> 
> progress through the game
> 
> that's up to you
