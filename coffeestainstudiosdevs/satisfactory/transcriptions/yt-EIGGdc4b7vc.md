### Transcript

> do we have any holiday themed plans in the future uh no not right now um i know we want to do at some point but i don't know what we this it takes a lot of planning to do it so we need to at least like three months before we do it we need to know that we're doing it um so no idea maybe we'll do like uh in my head this is my reasoning here you guys this isn't our this isn't confident reasoning but in my head it would make sense if we did like a halloween thing this year and like do one event every year until we're like 1.0 because then you get like and then restart the events every year so you'd get like all the events i mean it would be for new players there would be a lot of new events if they play but for you guys it would be the same event essentially but you'd always get like at least one new thing every year uh i think that would be cool but that's that's my guessing i don't think that's actually what we're planning for but i think i personally i think that would be cool we'll see what happens
