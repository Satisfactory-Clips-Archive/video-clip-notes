> of cool stuff in in in this thing and
> it's it's interesting because like it's
> a
> it's a piece of equipment you equip and
> that gives you access to like all this
> stuff
> so it's just a bunch of extra stuff so i
> have like an antenna
> that like runs i think i think this runs

> sure what this
> uh is used for
> but it looks cool cause you hook it up
> with power and everything
> is that texture the uh standard engine
> texture
> on the base no it looks like the the
> the yeah it looks like it right
> yeah yeah it is no shade that's fine
> just no [ __ ] yeah just looking oh look
> while also looking like
> it's amazing i have like a hog here so
> that's a perfect opportunity to showcase
> this
> the [ __ ] rocket launcher oh we do
> have one huh
> yeah uh it doesn't look amazing now
> because the [ __ ] resolution is dog
> [ __ ] or like
> i'm running in in a super nintendo but
> you can essentially use this like clear
> out a whole [ __ ] forest
> oh really yeah like oh my god
> there you are guys
> so everyone this is true yeah this is
> how to clear it up fast
> it's because potato power
> and that one is just called like rocket
> launcher that's a separate mod
> uh but yeah more factory like what time
> is it yeah
> so so there's just a lot of it here um
> there's a lot of cosmetic stuff and
> there's a lot of cool
> uh things like i think my favorite thing
> in this are the doors let me showcase
> this i have one here
> so like when you approach these they
> like slide open
> oh yeah a lot of people have been
> suggesting those as well yeah
> it's so cool yeah it's really cool and
> like it's also solves like the issue
> with doors in general when like
> the they'll like physically [ __ ] up
> because doors are [ __ ] hard to make
> in games in general
> uh but having a sliding one it solves
> that problem so it's really nice
> um so yeah another really neat mod
> that's not part of more factors as a
> separate one
> is this thing which i think we're going
> to add this
> to the game but having slanted uh
> fences here yeah
> i think that's something we're gonna add
> i'm pretty sure we just haven't gotten
> around to it
> but there's a mod for it in the
> meanwhile so you can check that out
> while you're missing
> uh but yeah i don't know to some degree
> i don't want to like showcase too much
> because i also want people to like
> download this and try it out themselves
> if they want to explore themselves uh
> but this is a really cool mod there's
> even a [ __ ] crane here
> look at this [ __ ]
> it's amazing
> oh yeah that's so cool
> um so yeah i highly recommend this mod
> because it's really sweet
> um again saying where's the tony hawk's
> pro skater mod where you can grind that
> sick rail
> [Laughter]
> what do you what do you mean mod update
