### Transcript

> So as Oscar, our Game Director said in the PC Gamer interview
> You will not have to defend your base,  and the main justification for this is again, the map is huge and
> traversing it can take some time and you definitely don't want
> creatures destroying your base, your perfectly optimised base while you're ages away and you're unable to come back and
> defend it basically. So while you're exploring you're gonna be running into hostile creatures, so let's not forget about that!
> It's kind of dangerous out there!
