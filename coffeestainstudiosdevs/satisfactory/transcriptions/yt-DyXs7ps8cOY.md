> very good update five this year it's possible it's possible that the fight comes out this year yeah i think so uh it's possible it depends on how ambitious we get because like it feels like we're getting more and more ambitious every update uh because like update four is is pretty big like in terms of content like like you mentioned before update three really changed a lot with the game uh and update four won't change you know the whole game but like it will add a ton of new stuff yeah uh more like feature stuff than update three really did so it's it's it's possible but the other thing to keep in mind is like update three came out like january i think it was last year so it's been over eight years in february an update but but there have been updates like last year we got um steam version out there was the fluids update and then other smaller minor updates in between as well um so it's possible that we could get update five out this year if like we went straight on to update five then maybe yeah but i have a feeling we're gonna try and release like a minor update at some point too um in between update four and five so or we'll just do like a bunch of smaller updates i don't know we haven't decided yet yeah
