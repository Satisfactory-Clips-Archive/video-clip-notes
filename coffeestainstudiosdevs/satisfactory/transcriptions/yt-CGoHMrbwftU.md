> 
> gonna be like we're gonna
> 
> prioritize like optimization for
> 
> multiplayer and then that will probably
> 
> take some time because that's a big
> 
> bit of a bigger issue uh but what i
> 
> wanted to get with this was dedicated
> 
> servers is
> 
> its own beast like dedicated server is
> 
> not like tied into
> 
> update 4 or update 5. dedicated servers
>

> 
> we are going to prioritize steady good
> 
> servers a bit more now
> 
> once now that we've gotten the steam
> 
> release out of the way
> 
> because there were both things that we
> 
> were
> 
> working on on like the steam release
> 
> that also tied into dedicated servers
> 
> which is kind of nice
> 
> um so we got a bit of work done on that
> 
> part
> 
> but now like once uh once
> 
> we're back we're gonna focus about a bit
> 
> more on dedicated servers so we can
> 
> hopefully
> 
> get that out asap um
> 
> that being said there's still so much
> 
> work i think
> 
> i don't know i haven't worked on it uh
> 
> on that stuff
> 
> um so like i don't i wouldn't see
> 
> dedicated servers coming out like
> 
> i wouldn't say like next month like or a
> 
> month of that like it'll probably take
> 
> some time so i don't know like
> 
> how how much in before update 4 you'll
> 
> actually get dedicated servers
> 
> um but we are prioritizing that now
> 
> about
> 
> like a lot more um and
> 
> our ambition is that we we get dedicated
> 
> servers out before update 4
> 
> is is the plan but with anything
> 
> with our development cycles and and
> 
> delay staying
> 
> studios things just get shifted a lot
> 
> stuff change you know like it's both
> 
> things that we
> 
> probably could have planned better for
> 
> but it's also like things that we didn't
> 
> think about
> 
> um and that's just the way it is making
> 
> making these type of ambitious games
> 
> it's that's just the way the cookie
