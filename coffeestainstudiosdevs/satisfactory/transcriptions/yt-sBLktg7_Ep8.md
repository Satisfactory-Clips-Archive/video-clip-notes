> 
> one branch we were working towards and
> 
> then we were going to release that for
> 
> whatever update or
> 
> which meant that like if you're not if
> 
> your work wasn't tied into that
> 
> then people didn't like fully have
> 
> something to do so they would work on
> 
> other things
> 
> and it was kind of messy to like merge
> 
> it um so now we're working on like
> 
> separate branches which means that some
> 
> people are working like on update four
> 
> some people are working on the fluid
> 
> update some people are working on
> 
> general like updates to the game so we
> 
> have like the world branch
> 
> that's just like general updates to the
> 
> world and uh
> 
> level design and all that jazz and then
> 
> now for the
> 
> the fluid update we're gonna be like all
> 
> right let's pick the stuff that we need
> 
> for the fluid update and combine them
> 
> uh into the branch that's going up for
> 
> for that
> 
> uh which is like which means that it's a
> 
> bit messier and there's like an extra
> 
> step
> 
> but it means that we can work more long
> 
> term and we can focus on getting the
> 
> game to like 1.0
> 
> while still doing these like kind of
> 
> updates to the game and not feeling
> 
> locked up
> 
> by those um so that's
> 
> pretty much still going and it's going
> 
> pretty good so far
> 
> um and uh yeah hopefully
> 
> soon enough we'll have that juicy fluid
> 
> update up
