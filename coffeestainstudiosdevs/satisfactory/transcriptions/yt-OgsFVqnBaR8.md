### Transcript

> mark three miners need to have a few outputs as bells yeah we we know about that issue as well that's something that we're gonna fix in the future um the issue with the i know some people also ask like mark six belts the issue with the mark six belt is that we have a issue in the game with um uh precision of of uh the belt so like if you don't have like great performance then the precision of the belts kind of like diminish the faster they go so you can run into like cases where you don't get 100 efficiency even though you should uh and that's something we already have issues with with the mark v belt so if you introduce like even faster belts that issue is going to be getting worse and i believe that's an issue with bel uh pipes as well so same same kind of thing there like if you're running into issues with pipes where you think like it's you should be getting 300 or 600 or whatever um if you're not getting like if you don't have like 60 fps in most cases uh then uh that is one of the causes for that and there's no simple solution to that apart from reducing like the um the the flow rate for us uh because it's it's like out of our reach technically so to speak it has to do with uh how floating point numbers work um so it's like not really feasible to just increase it we'd have to lower it and rebalance everything else uh in that in those cases does higher than 60fps affect anything uh well yeah you get more precision essentially um so yeah the higher the better but around 60 is like you shouldn't have any issues at that point so you don't need to go like 120 um fps just make new numbers all right we'll just reinvent how computers work fantastic let's do it
