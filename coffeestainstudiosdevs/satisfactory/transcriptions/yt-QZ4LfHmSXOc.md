> first league ever
>
> what motivated the change for the geiser
>
> geisha
>
> node thing so the the main
>
> thing that motivated us for us was
>
> because nobody was using
>
> the geothermal stuff so
>
> we felt that like and we needed to
>
> update it anyway so we and we felt like
>
> the the here's the thing with all the
>
> power generators in the game we want
>
> there to be
>
> some form of interesting decision making
>
> for all the power generators in the game
>
> um
>
> so and if you this is this is one of the
>
> main reasons why we aren't going to add
>
> you know wind turbines and stuff like
>
> that unless we figure something out
>
> that makes it interesting to use them
>
> but we want there to be
>
> you know an interesting decision making
>
> based on
>
> how you use view generators
>
> we want there to be some kind of
>
> trade-off um
>
> and you know we just don't want to give
>
> you
>
> power that's the thing we just want to
>
> you don't want to be like here's power
>
> do whatever you want the only exception
>
> is like coal because coal
>
> is supposed to be the main trade-off for
>
> automating fuel
>
> it's supposed to be a big step up from
>
> from uh biomass because biomass is
>
> tedious as hell
>
> so coal becomes like you know your
>
> savior of power needs
>
> uh in the early game
>
> um geothermal is too little power too
>
> late in the game
>
> the thing is geotherm you can get
>
> geothermal before you get coal so it's
>
> not really true that's a late game thing
>
> you can get it
>
> pretty soon pretty early um
>
> and yeah the the way we implemented it
>
> was just like we wanted to make it
>
> interesting we wanted so we implemented
>
> as oscillating because you can use the
>
> geothermal
>
> in in tandem with the power storage just
>
> so you get an even flow
>
> and we thought that was pretty
>
> interesting so that's why we implemented
>
> this way
>
> and then we're trying it out and see you
>
> guys think about it and if people
>
> still don't use geothermal then you know
>
> we'll make changes to it again like this
>
> is a game in early access you you never
>
> know
