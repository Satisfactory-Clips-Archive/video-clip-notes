### Transcript

> there you are there you go that's the
>
> that's the little teaser
>
> yeah all right so yeah that's um yeah as
>
> it was saying it's called the packager
>
> uh packages things packages things yeah
>
> and there is literally no mark ii like
>
> yeah there really isn't a mark ii
>
> it's called mark one uh and i think that
>
> was
>
> for effect in like on the buildable i
>
> don't think they
>
> i don't think the artists i don't know i
>
> don't know the reason why it's called
>
> mark one but
>
> there's i mean someone's getting fired
>
> it doesn't matter right
>
> and it's gonna be me and and why not um
>
> so so uh so yeah that was the packager
>
> and i actually
>
> we're actually gonna talk a lot about it
>
> usually we haven't really done this
>
> before
>
> where when we see something we like
>
> reveal what it actually is
>
> but we're gonna try it out we're gonna
>
> try to and see it is so mark has sent me
>
> a ton of information about it
>
> um so we're gonna put some of the
>
> speculation to rest so to speak
>
> um so yeah it is a packager it it it
>
> replaces the feature the functionality
>
> from the refinery
>
> uh that is the packaging part and the
>
> thing this
>
> the way this is gonna work is that the
>
> functionality of packaging in refineries
>
> is not going to be removed immediately
>
> it's still going to be available in your
>
> save files but you will not be able to
>
> do it
>
> on newly built refineries so
>
> um if you have set up like the packaging
>
> thing on your current
>
> build and with your refineries that will
>
> still work and they will all function
>
> and everything
>
> uh but as soon as you start building a
>
> new one it's you won't be able to to do
>
> packaging stuff essentially
>
> um and it it is a smaller building it's
>
> i don't know how easy it is to tell from
>
> the video but it is a much smaller
>
> building it can fit on one foundation
>
> block
>
> and it's like roughly three walls high i
>
> think
>
> yeah it's less than three walls high but
>
> it perfectly fits on one single
>
> foundation so it's much smaller
>
> and it consumes less power it contains
>
> 10 megawatts of power instead of the 30
>
> megawatts that a regular
>
> refinery uh consumes um
>
> and one thing that mark also pointed out
>
> that i
>
> that i'm going to point out as well so
>
> the reason why the packaging wasn't
>
> packaged or wasn't in the
>
> regular update 3 is because
>
> we just didn't have time to finish it so
>
> we kind of took that functionality and
>
> baked it into the refinery
>
> and now that we have a little bit more
>
> time we want to separate it also because
>
> of community
>
> um uh by like popular demand from
>
> community that it is
>
> a bit of cumbersome to use refineries
>
> for packaging because it's an expensive
>
> building
>
> and it needs more power and it's big
>
> mostly that it's big i think it's
>
> annoying
>
> um so we're gonna separate those two and
>
> make it into a packager
>
> um the one thing the key thing here as
>
> well
>
> is that this is only for packaging and
>
> unpackaging so
>
> the the thing where like with the
>
> dilated diluted packaging fuel
>
> thing that will not be available in the
>
> packager because
>
> in that sense you're actually mixing
>
> fluids and that doesn't make sense to
>
> have in the packager
>
> so that's not something that's going to
>
> be available in the packager
>
> and i know that's something that's a
>
> feature that would add us to like one of
>
> the mods
>
> that's doing packaging but that's
>
> something that we didn't like um because
>
> it makes some of the recipes
>
> like it makes specific setups
>
> very overpowered um so we didn't feel
>
> comfortable adding that to the packager
>
> so that functionality is still part of
>
> the refinery system
>
> and yeah that's that's that's pretty
>
> much
>
> most of the info about that the input
>
> and outputs are also
>
> stacked that's not something that we've
>
> done a lot i think that's the first
>
> building
>
> we've done that with at least production
>
> building
>
> and that's something we're going to try
>
> out um we
>
> we feel like it's pretty we think it's
>
> going to be a good solution but
>
> we'll have to see after some feedback
>
> from people um
>
> but yeah that's that's the packager
>
> essentially
>
> cool and there's no more tube and there
>
> is no mark ii
>
> uh and a lot of people keep asking about
>
> the um maintenance because there's
>
> that animation where it sort of just
>
> like explodes and goes everywhere uh no
>
> there's no maintenance uh yeah
>
> that's just we have that's animation we
>
> have uh
>
> like easter egg animations in a lot of
>
> our buildings
>
> uh i've had that for a while so it's
>
> just one of those
>
> and we were thinking of like should we
>
> include that in the in the teaser or not
>
> um because it is an easter egg like most
>
> of the buildings have some sort of
>
> animation easter egg
>
> yeah if you remember like our old
>
> nuclear power plant
>
> we used to have like this thing where
>
> like an arm would like pick up the
>
> fuel rods and stuff and it would like
>
> drop it
>
> yeah that was pretty good yeah there was
>
> a youtube channel that i saw that was
>
> deconstructing the uh the trailer
>
> and they said the same thing they were
>
> like yeah it could be maintenance it
>
> could happen if it overflows or
>
> it's just another custom animation and
>
> we have a lot of those weird things
>
> and of course as bastion says here the
>
> unfortunate issue that we've run into is
>
> uh yeah no maintenance as in no pipes so
>
> if we confirm something it's confirmed
>
> if we
>
> confirm it's not something that it's
>
> confirmed that it is so
>
> uh yeah sure our maintenance coming soon
>
> what else
>
> we're referring to it as the coffee
>
> stain fallacy because like no matter
>
> what we say everything is confirmed
>
> obviously first even yeah exactly
