> 
> all right anyway um no it's it's uh it
> 
> changes a lot of different settings uh
> 
> it has to do with uh both
> 
> like like bandwidth settings between
> 
> client and server it's also bandwidth
> 
> settings between server and client
> 
> because they're calculated differently
> 
> um
> 
> it's just it's just like changes general
> 
> network
> 
> quality settings depending on your
> 
> the reason why they exist is because
> 
> depending on
> 
> your like internet connection and how
> 
> you're set up
> 
> like if you're sitting behind more than
> 
> one router or if you're you know
> 
> that kind of stuff um then
> 
> you can run into an issue where if you
> 
> try to send too much
> 
> bandwidth over your your network that
> 
> you can't
> 
> uh process it then that's worse
> 
> than being in the opposite where like
> 
> you send less data than you can
> 
> because you'll run into like overflow
> 
> issues and that will just make
> 
> that will kind of collect up and cause a
> 
> lot of issues
> 
> so that's why we set it low from the get
> 
> go we are gonna
> 
> increase that a little bit because we
> 
> found uh from
> 
> feedback from players that the the
> 
> in-game like bandwidth that we're using
> 
> right now is a little bit low compared
> 
> to like all the people playing our game
> 
> um so we're going to up it a little bit
> 
> but yeah generally it just increases the

> check out unreal engines
> 
> um what is it uh unreal engine
> 
> like
> 
> there's no this is this is so annoying

> because
> 
> it's complicated right and even when you
> 
> explain it to someone
> 
> who knows what i'm talking about uh even
> 
> then it's still complicated to explain
> 
> it because there are so many factors to
> 
> it because it's complex
> 
> like network in general is very very
> 
> very complex like i think it's
> 
> downplayed how complex it is
> 
> um in a lot of cases but check out
> 
> unreal engines if you want like a more
> 
> in depth of like what actually happens
> 
> check out unreal engines like network uh
> 
> [Music]
> 
> page their documentation
> 
> what is it network config
> 
> i think just their journal like advanced
> 
> multiplayer
> 
> bandwidth tips yeah yeah
> 
> so yeah it has to do with like net
> 
> update frequency and
> 
> that jazz um and the higher
> 
> it is the more essential you're sending
> 
> in a smaller amount of time
