> so okay uh can we talk about the cost of
>
> the uh the extractors and the

>
> are we in in production for those uh
>
> i have some basic numbers i would
>
> actually have to check up on my own
>

> there might be more early game gases
>
> that would probably use this building as

>
> as well
>
> uh and they they would be like popping
