### Transcript

> yeah so dylan's using visual studio here
> 
> and
> 
> we actually have a little bit split
> 
> right now because some people
> 
> like i think it's half and half right
> 
> now half of the programmers are using
> 
> visual studio
> 
> the other half are using writer yeah
> 
> there's a new tool that's like in beta
> 
> right now for
> 
> specifically made for unreal engine
> 
> development
> 
> um because there are a few quirks with
> 
> how visual studio works essentially it's
> 
> just like visual studio is not great for
> 
> big c plus projects um
> 
> because it tries to load in so like it's
> 
> pretty bloated
> 
> image show um so like searching for
> 
> files and finding reference and stuff
> 
> like that is really slow
> 
> and also like unreal engine has like
> 
> their own
> 
> way of handling like macros for c
> 
> plus plus which is also like a rabbit
> 
> hole itself
> 
> and vicious studio is like very generic
> 
> so it tries to handle
> 
> like all the cases for any way you can
> 
> do it which
> 
> isn't super good um so there's a plugin
> 
> that we're using
> 
> which is called visual assist that tries
> 
> to help
> 
> out a little bit makes it it goes from
> 
> basically unusable to
> 
> i would say quite usable but yeah white
> 
> assist is
> 
> unreal without it is a nightmare and i
> 
> think they know that
> 
> they have unreal specific settings as
> 
> well and then ryder is like
> 
> specifically made just for unreal engine
> 
> development so they've
> 
> only included like the stuff that you
> 
> really need
> 
> for making gains in a real engine which
> 
> makes
> 
> the visual assist part also a lot faster
> 
> so even then um
> 
> but to be fair i think the debugger tool
> 
> for a rider is is
> 
> a bit worse um yeah usually when i've
> 
> done stuff
> 
> i use rider most of the time and then i
> 
> run into like a bug
> 
> and i'm like i need to debug this and
> 
> then i boot up visual studio just
> 
> because i want to use the debugger there
> 
> instead
> 
> hopefully that would get better i
> 
> actually tried writer and just dropped
> 
> it immediately when i found the debugger
> 
> not working but i think it's in beta so
> 
> i think they're making a lot of
> 
> improvements yeah
> 
> the debugger wasn't working for me also
> 
> because you need to do a little bit of
> 
> extra setup
> 
> so yeah once i figured that out i was
> 
> like oh then it
> 
> then it's more usable but i just don't
> 
> like the interface
> 
> right now it's it's it's i just don't
> 
> want to re-learn as
> 
> you know can't teach you because it's
> 
> kind of like xcode
> 
> interface for the debugger which i
> 
> didn't i don't care for the xcode
> 
> personally so
