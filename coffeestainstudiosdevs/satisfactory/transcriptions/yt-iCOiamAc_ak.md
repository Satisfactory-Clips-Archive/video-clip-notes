> make sure to hit it up uh so i have one
>
> question here this is something that
>
> i've also thought about and something
>
> i know we we changed it for a reason but
>
> uh where
>
> some buildings when it's like the
>
> smelters for instance when it
>
> receives like copper uh ore it will be
>
> like oh
>
> i want to make a copper ingot because
>
> this is copper ore this is how it used
>
> to work
>
> um and we changed this for a reason i'm
>
> pretty sure but i don't remember why
>
> remember why mark i don't even i've
>
> never seen it work like that i think
>
> okay
>
> it was like in the old old old old
>
> builds uh
>
> it actually happened in the build that i
>
> played with jace uh a while ago when we
>
> checked the retrospective of
>
> uh i think that vaude is still up where
>
> you can check it out where me and jace
>
> essentially played like the first
>
> two tiers i think in a way old build
>
> like way pre-alpha um and that that was
>
> the case there like if you
>
> put down a smelter and you feed it in
>
> copper ore it will be like oh you want
>
> to make copper ingots
>
> uh i think my personal like like um
>
> guess would be that it would become uh
>
> inconsistent with the rest of the game
>
> so like you learn that oh this building
>
> just automatically switches recipes
>
> but then when you actually need to set
>
> recipes you haven't been taught that by
>
> the game
>
> um yeah it does i think it does
>
> pose a big inconsistency issue where it
>
> would be super beneficial for smelters
>
> for example which only have one input
>
> and a limited amount of recipes
>
> but then when you get to constructors
>
> you can maybe make multiple
>
> things out of the same input item like
>
> for example you put in iron ingots do
>
> you want to make iron plates or iron
>
> rods how is the game supposed to know
>
> what you want to make
>
> yeah yeah so yeah it seems like we both
>
> have
>
> the same like it just becomes
>
> inconsistent with the game
>
> um you get this quality of life feature
>
> that doesn't always hold up so
>
> just it's just weird and it becomes
>
> harder to explain that
