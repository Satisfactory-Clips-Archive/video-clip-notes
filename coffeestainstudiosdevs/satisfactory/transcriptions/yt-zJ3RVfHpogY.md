> is your xx12 fully supported now hell no i'm so sorry i didn't mean to sound so derogatory uh no the directx 12 thing that we put in the experimental build that was just as like a test to see how bad it is and it was worse than we thought kind of um i don't know if we will we will ever uh support it honestly because uh it just didn't work that well at all like that was kind of why we tested it just to see like the potential of it and it's not looking great with the current way we've made the game um so there's a lot of work we need to put in to support directx 12.
