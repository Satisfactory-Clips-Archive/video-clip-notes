### Transcript

> i'm gonna see if i can find that video
>
> where jace talks about
>
> tier seven rebalancing in general um
>
> for those who don't know uh for update
>
> four we're gonna do a little bit of
>
> rebalancing in tier seven
>
> um just because there's this bit too
>
> much grind
>
> i guess is or how would you put it mark
>
> uh there's like multiple issues of
>
> course we want to rework the
>
> uh the nuclear stuff and that's not
>
> because i think it's too hard but we
>
> wanted to do
>
> more with it we want to like uh i think
>
> uh tim already spoiled this we want to
>
> do stuff with the nuclear waste right
>
> yeah and that and that makes it so that
>
> this becomes suddenly a way bigger thing
>
> and we need to kind of make sure that
>
> those things are are properly balanced
>
> to each other so we need to rebalance
>
> that and also then the blender comes in
>
> and we want to use that building
>
> to make the production lines a bit nicer
>
> generally
>
> so that means yeah we just need to
>
> rework that part and then for
>
> the bauxite refinement uh we noticed a
>
> lot of people
>
> uh felt that they hit a wall when they
>
> got there and that might have been
>
> partially because
>
> uh there's not a lot to unlock after
>
> that so it feels kind of like you're
>
> doing all this work for
>
> for no reason but additionally
>
> it is a lot of work to get that and get
>
> production going for aluminium ingots
>
> and
>
> a lot of refineries again uh so we're
>
> trying to mitigate that by
>
> just making the numbers nicer we're kind
>
> of keeping the same structure so you
>
> will still need
>
> to have like this flow of going from
>
> illumina to scrap
>
> to ingot but we're making the numbers a
>
> lot
>
> easier to deal with and we're reducing
>
> the amount of refineries quite
>
> drastically
>
> all right that sounds good uh so i'm
>
> just going to post in chat
>
> the link to the tier viii video that we
>
> put out with
>
> where jace and by
>
> extension mark actually goes a little
>
> bit more in depth
>
> as to like what this means for you guys
>
> because
>
> uh it will affect your save files if you
>
> already
>
> have you know tier seven going and all
>
> that production going
>
> um and uh mark give
>
> gives his top 10 suggestions
>
> i don't know if you remember this park
>
> your top 10 tips
>
> on what you can do right now um
>
> to prepare for up before essentially
>
> and do you want to do you remember the
>
> tips
>
> you were actually um boy do i
>
> oh yeah i think it was stockpiling
>
> stuff don't invest in the
>
> new stuff i think that was it actually
>
> yeah that was it
>
> [Laughter]
>
> was the top 10 tips right for mark you
>
> heard it right from the source
>
> um so essentially just to clarify a
>
> little bit as well
>
> um we usually when we talk about you
>
> know updating the game we usually
>
> refer to the the term like we break your
>
> saves and when we say we break your
>
> states we don't actually mean that your
>
> safes won't load as in like they'll
>
> become useless
>
> it just means that you know the
>
> production buildings will still load and
>
> everything but
>
> like you know if we change how a recipe
>
> works that that means that that machine
>
> machine how do i why am i person like
>
> that uh pronouncing like that
>
> uh machines that have a certain recipe
>
> if we change like the
>
> the balancing of that it will still load
>
> up the machine and we'll be like oh but
>
> this recipe now takes this
>
> and if you're feeding it something else
>
> it won't work so
>
> that's essentially what's going to
>
> happen with your tier 7 stuff so if you
>
> haven't reached tier 7 yet
>
> in in your current save file then you're
>
> going to be unaffected essentially when
>
> we release update 4.
>
> if you have reached tier 7 and you've
>
> started working on like nuclear stuff
>
> uh you can still stockpile on parts and
>
> use those to re
>
> to remake your factory or rebalance
>
> refactor your factory um
>
> or potentially like you can maybe rework
>
> like a little bit tweak it a bit to make
>
> it work but it sounds like as far as i
>
> know at least i'm not
>
> 100 sure what the new new but it sounds
>
> like it's going to be a lot of new
>
> um production lines so to speak
>
> as to how nuclear will work so uh
>
> you might wanna just mass dismantle that
>
> um and rebuild it
>
> cool
