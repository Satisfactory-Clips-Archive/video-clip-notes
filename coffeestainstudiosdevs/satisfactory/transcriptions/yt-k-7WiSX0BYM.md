> pcs
>
> uh and or mac linux and consoles or
>

> again that's like this uh quote-unquote
>
> distraction
>
> like i know it feels bad to say when
>
> there are people who want to use
>
> controllers but
>
> when the game keeps evolving and
>
> changing that's one of the reasons we
>
> stopped
>
> doing control support it's like the
>
> controller mappings just kept changing
>
> because we kept adding and changing
>
> functionality
>
> so it's like we'll just wait till the
