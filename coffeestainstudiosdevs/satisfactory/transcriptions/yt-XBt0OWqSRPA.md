>
> coming some people guessed that maybe
>
> this is like a
>
> you know it's kind of like a centrifuge
>
> that can be used through that process
>
> and
>
> you're kind of right it sort of does act
>
> as that or i think it has one or
>
> something like that i can't remember
>
> what mark said
>
> but um the the blender is a new it is an
>
> instrumental piece of uh
>
> machinery for the nuclear rework so it
>
> plays a big role in nuclear
>
> rework but it also plays a big role in
>
> other things too
>
> you guys may have noticed in the fixmas
>
> advent calendar that
