>
> put out our experimental builds um early

>

>

>
> nanite
>

>

>

>
> um but we don't know yeah but i don't
>
> know
>
> like we will be updating on real engine
>
> we're we're kind of like
>
> you have like two type of developers

>
> some always update engine and there's
>
> some lock in on an engine version and we
>

>
> like that
>
> they are making stuff in the engine
>
> that they are implementing because of
>
> those games that actually benefit us a

> lot
>
> um so that's one of the nice things
>
> about like if you compare
>
> for instance unity with unreal engine or
>
> godot or whatever that epic are still
>
> making games
>
> like fortnite but fortnite is like the
>
> only one but on paper they're still
>
> developing like games and uh
>
> even if they that was like the thing is
>
> like even if they didn't have the
>
> success of fortnite they would still
>
> have
>
> you know games that they're working on
>
> because
>
> it makes it practical and i and that's
>
> really nice um
