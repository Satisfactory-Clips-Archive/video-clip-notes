>
> we we don't like that solution because
>
> it feel you it feels like you get way
>
> overpowered but
>
> the problem with the way it is right now
>
> is
>
> i'm gonna i'm gonna let you guys in a
>
> little secret here okay
>
> from the beginning the game was the
>
> equipment was designed around the fact
>
> that you had
>
> a body slot for each like segment of
>
> your body so you had one body slot for
>
> your head one for your
>
> chest back i think it was back your
>
> hands
>
> your feet like we had body slots for for
>
> your your body parts essentially and the
>
> equipment was kind of came from that
>
> design
>
> but the problem when you have everything
>
> but body slug
>
> but when you have all the things
>
> equipped at the same time we felt like
>
> you got a little bit too op
>
> and it felt like you're breezing through
>
> exploration too much
>
> so we didn't like that so we limited the
>
> amount of body slots
>
> to two but
>
> that creates other problems given the
>
> fact that our equipment is
>
> made for that old way
>
> so what we're gonna probably do at some
>
> point is we're gonna like
>
> look over the equipment system uh
>
> overall
>
> and change it to fit
>
> that like to fix that problem i think um
>
> so that you won't run into this issue
>
> but maybe we won't have like body slots
>
> like that maybe we'll do something else
>
> with it
>
> i'm not quite sure exactly what that
>
> would look like i mean none of us are
>
> currently because we need to revamp it
>
> and look at the different solutions
>
> but so yeah
