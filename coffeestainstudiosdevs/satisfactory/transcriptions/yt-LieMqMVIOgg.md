### Transcript

> cool cool so
>
> uh moving on one thing that we talked
>
> about
>
> well yeah you were asking about like
>
> other changes we might make before we
>
> pushed
>
> oh yeah yeah yeah yeah the one thing we
>
> haven't really talked about when it
>
> comes to plutonium is the current
>
> discussion
>
> uh regarding the the nitrogen and the
>
> bauxite usage in that production chain
>
> which is kind of the current problem
>
> that people are looking at um
>
> which was also kind of the issue that
>
> they were looking at before but that is
>
> kind of the remaining
>
> problem now with the balancing is that
>
> you need a lot of nitrogen and a lot of
>
> uh bauxite to actually get all the
>
> plutonium fuel rods out of your
>
> um yeah out of the uranium basically
>
> um and i'm not super out on it yet and
>
> i'm not sure how much people in the chat
>
> are aware of the
>
> the problem there i think basically you
>
> can kind of
>
> um what do you call that
>
> ground down simplify the discussion
>
> uh by saying that there are a bunch of
>
> players that think it's bad that
>
> plutonium requires these limited
>
> resources that you also want to use for
>
> high-end production right because it
>
> limits them right from making high in
>
> production
>
> and having the maximum amount of power
>
> available in their factory
>
> at the same time so they have to kind of
>
> do this trade-off between the two
>
> which was kind of intentional because i
>
> wanted to change the end game approach
>
> from kind of having to balance these
>
> different things to each other
>
> which is also a reason that we made the
>
> box side more accessible because then
>
> the bottleneck started becoming more
>
> other resources at certain points
>
> so then you would have to make decisions
>
> if you want to use maybe
>
> less quartz in certain parts like not
>
> using the
>
> the computer alternative speed that uses
>
> the crystal oscillators to save that
>
> quartz for more
>
> bauxite production for the
>
> what's it called now uh the turbo motor
>
> getting those different trade-offs and
>
> one of those trade-offs as well was the
>
> is the power versus high-end production
>
> that you kind of have to limit them to
>
> each other you can do both at max you
>
> have to
>
> split that but some players don't think
>
> that it's fun
>
> it seems so i'm still looking into that
>
> and seeing what the best course of
>
> action is yeah i guess and of course
>
> that's
>
> that's a hard part because there might
>
> be a lot of players that do think this
>
> might be a fun approach
>
> to the end game to balance those two
>
> things to each other
>
> yeah i guess it kind of like speaks
>
> for itself in the way that like we have
>
> a limited amount of resources
>
> on the the map and like it feels like
>
> maybe
>
> this is i'm speaking from my own
>
> perspective but it like whenever i play
>
> it feels like no
>
> i have infinite resources because the
>
> notes are infinite
>
> but you really do have to like
>
> like at some point it feels like when
>
> you played for a long time and you reach
>
> that end game you realize that there is
>
> a
>
> like it you hit a wall essentially and
>
> maybe it's not like
>
> yeah and then you hit that point where
>
> like you have to make a decision whether
>
> like you want to spend
>
> the notes on making turbo motors or if
>
> you want to
>
> get more power or whatever you want to
>
> do with that um
>
> so that's that's uh that's a tricky one
>
> yeah it's i mean it's just a vision
>
> problem in the end of like what is the
>
> best for the game because it is it is
>
> made for of course these
>
> hardcore players that want to go that
>
> route of actually trying to maximize
>
> everything yeah
>
> and of course they're theorizing about
>
> it now but if they ever would want to
>
> build it they want to have a solution
>
> for how can i approach
>
> the maximum potential of high tier parts
>
> and maximum potential of power to
>
> actually achieve such a factory
>
> i think currently it's stable enough
>
> that you can do both of them
>
> but of course not to their maximum
>
> potential because you're limited by
>
> one or the other
>
> the thing that we kind of have to decide
>
> is is
>
> if it is more fun for those players to
>
> have to deal with that issue or if it's
>
> not
>
> right and currently the people that are
>
> actually talking about it seem to be of
>
> the opinion that it's uh
>
> not more fun to do it uh
>
> what i'm always concerned about with
>
> these kind of topics is that the players
>
> that are maybe content with it
>
> or at this point not aware of it are not
>
> talking about it because
>
> it's not a worry to them right it's not
>
> uh frustrating them
>
> yeah it all goes back to the thing we
>
> talked about previously
>
> where the people that we interact with
>
> and give us feedback about this
>
> are maybe not the best representation of
>
> what everybody
>
> like the main player base cares about
>
> we're interacting with the hardcore
>
> people and the people that like are
>
> knee-deep in satisfactory uh yeah
>
> yeah i just kind of find that it's the
>
> hardcore people talking about this issue
>
> because it's kind of a
>
> balancing challenge that's made for them
>
> yeah
>
> but that's why it's also fine that if
>
> they if the majority of them agrees that
>
> it's not fun to have to do that that
>
> to have to solve that problem then we
>
> will probably change it
>
> or we kind of have to change it to that
>
> point because it is there for them
>
> right it's supposed to be fun for them
