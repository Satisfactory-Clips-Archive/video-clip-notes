> sure
> 
> [Music]
> 
> arachnophilia mode everyone plays
> 
> everything with spiders nah
> 
> nice ah [ __ ] i kind of i guess we could
> 
> mark everything as spiders and then put
> 
> images of spiders
> 
> i like with this one or that wouldn't
> 
> work that wouldn't work out this is a
> 
> halloween
> 
> like traumatization like trauma
> 
> halloween mod yeah
> 
> yeah and every time you play it's rng
> 
> whether it turns on oh my
> 
> god calm down satan
> 
> yeah i'll be able to upload a picture of
> 
> jason's face to replace the spiders i
> 
> think there's a mod there's a mod for
> 
> that
> 
> there's already a mod yeah it's all we
> 
> did
> 
> i like that you implemented reconfigure
> 
> mode even though i love spiders i have
> 
> problems with the accessibility thing
> 
> because
> 
> wouldn't it be annoying developers to
> 
> have to think of all these things uh you
> 
> can't think of any
> 
> everything and i think people who don't
> 
> like can say that they don't like
> 
> accessibility things uh and then say
> 
> well if we do one thing we got to do
> 
> everything i i hate that argument
> 
> because you're completely wrong
> 
> um you don't have to do everything
> 
> at all but there are some things that
> 
> are
> 
> quite big and you can choose to do them
> 
> or not and spiders
> 
> are actually the most uh in terms of
> 
> like arachnophobia is
> 
> the most prevalent phobia with within
> 
> animals and we have spiders that quite
> 
> frankly don't need to be spiders
> 
> uh and so so it's absolutely an
> 
> accessibility thing that we could do
> 
> which makes perfect sense we did a
> 
> really quick and
> 
> dirty solution helps a lot of people
> 
> it's like why not uh the other reason
> 
> there's a person with arachnophobia in
> 
> the office
> 
> so they couldn't work on the game
> 
> without without it so um yeah so i know
> 
> i i
> 
> hate that thing when everyone's like if
> 
> you do one thing you go do everything no
> 
> you don't you just
> 
> do what as much as you can or as much as
> 
> you want or don't do any if you really
> 
> don't want to
> 
> it's up to you as far as you justify
> 
> like yeah we have other accessibility
> 
> options so and like the more the better
> 
> it's like it's just the same as doing
> 
> colorblind yeah stuff for colorblind
> 
> well if you get a
> 
> you know um account for colorblind why
> 
> not account for everything yes like
> 
> oh okay sure dude if we think we would
> 
> just try and get as far as we can if we
> 
> could we would i mean we're never
> 
> we would never do it that's a it's a
> 
> crazy thing that you do everything but
> 
> um just hiring accessibility specialist
> 
> same as you would translator we could
> 
> get a
> 
> yeah i mean like even an accessibility
> 
> specialist couldn't even
> 
> do what the the argument is someone
> 
> could say well these are the way you
> 
> solve all these accessibility things and
> 
> then developers will sit there going
> 
> okay but that's a lot of things that we
> 
> need to do because there are so many
> 
> accessibility things but but there are
> 
> common things like for example uh hard
> 
> of hearing folks yeah
> 
> it's like well why did we take the time
> 
> to care about them it's because
> 
> they want to hear like it's you know we
> 
> had to make a bunch of changes because
> 
> people who had
> 
> hard of hearing couldn't use certain
> 
> tools in the game
> 
> uh so we had to make up systems for them
> 
> and it was a good idea
> 
> any plans for better accessibility for
> 
> us that are colored efficient
> 
> productivity
> 
> displays on machines are impossible yeah
> 
> that's been
> 
> like yeah yeah that's been in there
> 
> forever and yeah
> 
> it's it's like tricky to solve is it
> 
> it's it's something like because the
> 
> lighting changes
> 
> the way you perceive those guys so we've
> 
> done like one change like we've done
> 
> one pass of like trying to change it uh
> 
> but i believe
> 
> we have plans for it like or if it's
> 
> coming i don't quite remember i wonder
> 
> if it's just something that's just
> 
> dropped off of the wayside i feel like
> 
> it's a very solvable
> 
> maybe i don't remember because i
> 
> remember talking about it with uh
> 
> your artists yeah um but we know about
> 
> that issue
> 
> um and uh hopefully we can get that
> 
> that's a yeah that's definitely an old
> 
> one
> 
> for sure yeah that's why i love grounded
> 
> they turn their spiders into harmless
> 
> blobs yeah for sure
> 
> uh and and like they've got a really
> 
> complex system
> 
> in grounded and i think that's great
> 
> considering that
> 
> you know spiders play a really big and
> 
> key role in their game
> 
> right so i i think it makes a lot of
> 
> sense for them to spend some time and
> 
> yeah
> 
> some love on it whereas in our case they
> 
> don't really spend
> 
> you know they're not like a massive part
> 
> of the game switching to
> 
> cat faces is it's a solution
> 
> is is a very quick solution i i made it
> 
> in a day
> 
> um yeah
> 
> well you actually made something in a
> 
> day the first time oh
> 
> [ __ ]
> 
> i have more reasons for weapons in the
> 
> future i think there's gonna be
> 
> expansion on weapons
> 
> and there's gonna be more monsters i
> 
> know at least one monster at least
> 
> i'm a grass man even tiny spiders get
> 
> the daylights out of me
> 
> yeah i just said grass man i was like
> 
> and and that's that's another thing with
> 
> uh arachnophobia is
> 
> um and it is like
> 
> uh some folks say that spy oh yeah
> 
> spiders are creepy
> 
> so i don't want to see them that's fine
> 
> we have a mode for that
> 
> and some folks are like the cats they're
> 
> kind of creepy as well they're a little
> 
> scary
> 
> you know like i jump when i see them and
> 
> it's like okay
> 
> but but there's something completely
> 
> different between something being scary
> 
> and a phobia a phobia is like a strong
> 
> irrational response within your body
> 
> it's physical it's mental
> 
> and it completely [ __ ] with you um
> 
> and you know some people you know the
> 
> heart rate increases start sweating
> 
> apart
> 
> anxiety attacks mom spaghetti
> 
> literally like sensations and and
> 
> hallucinations of spiders walking on the
> 
> things like that it's like why not make
> 
> a moat
> 
> anyway i talked about that enough i
> 
> farted that was someone read it
> 
> very fitting that's that's the way we
> 
> can move on yes
> 
> that's our segway right
