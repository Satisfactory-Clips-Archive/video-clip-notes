> 
> uh a lot of people are like still like
>

> 
> you would actually
> 
> use it for like if you have three split
> 
> pipes or something and you want like a
> 
> uneven
> 
> flow rate between them you can now set
> 
> the maximum flow rate
> 
> uh like on each pipe so like be like oh
> 
> i want 50 floated on this one or
> 
> 300 on this one and then i want the rest
> 
> on the last pipe or whatever
> 
> now you can do that so it gives you a
> 
> little bit more control
> 
> um in that regard and
> 
> one second i have like a really quick
> 
> note about that it's
> 
> so it doesn't stop head lift i saw a lot
> 
> of people
> 
> uh discuss this when they saw because
> 
> the the the the
> 
> i didn't even realize this but i'm
> 
> pretty happy that i did this because
> 
> when i placed the mark ii pumps i didn't
> 
> use the snapping
> 
> for it i placed them kind of regular um
> 
> because of the way i set up the trailer
> 
> the one thing that i noticed was i was
> 
> i kept placing them like a little bit
> 
> below 50 meters
> 
> and then at the end when the valve shows
> 
> up it's actually
> 
> the maximum like 50 or 55 or something
> 
> and then people speculate are like is
> 
> the valve doing something with the head
> 
> lift
> 
> and the answer is no the valve has no
> 
> impact on the head lift but it does stop
> 
> backflow so it is directional so
> 
> uh you have to like set it in the angle
> 
> that you want
> 
> the valve to handle backflow
> 
> um so yeah pip rod uh pip rod
> 
> knew it they told you all and now you
> 
> all know
> 
> there you are yeah we're just conveying
> 
> their message to you all
