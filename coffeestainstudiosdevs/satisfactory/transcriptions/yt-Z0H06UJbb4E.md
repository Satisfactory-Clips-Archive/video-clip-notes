### Transcript

> mass foundation creation um
> 
> mark talked about this a while ago like
> 
> before holiday vacation
> 
> um where we
> 
> oh maybe this was a video that jace put
> 
> out but we talked about
> 
> essentially that we are kind of
> 
> considering you know doing some kind of
> 
> um not blueprints but like
> 
> some kind of similar system or or
> 
> something that makes sense in our game
> 
> we don't think that blueprints
> 
> by like the way the blueprints are like
> 
> implemented in other games like factorio
> 
> we don't think that makes sense in our
> 
> game but we are looking into
> 
> you know some kind of similar system to
> 
> that
> 
> to make late game building more
> 
> enjoyable
> 
> as you as you may know we're still done
> 
> not done with the game there's still a
> 
> lot of stuff to do with it and a lot of
> 
> people
> 
> you know think it's tedious when you
> 
> reach the end game to not be able to
> 
> like
> 
> you know mass build and stuff like that
> 
> and we we take that into
> 
> consideration uh part of the game part
> 
> of what makes this game fun too
> 
> is like there's two problems math mass
> 
> building
> 
> uh there's one where the object
> 
> constraint limit with the engine
> 
> that makes if if we enable more people
> 
> to build bigger things then they're
> 
> gonna run into
> 
> that wall much quicker that's one
> 
> problem the other problem is that
> 
> um a lot of aspects as to what makes the
> 
> game fun
> 
> is the fact that you are you know this
> 
> pioneer
> 
> and you're hand selecting stuff and
> 
> building stuff
> 
> building up this everything by yourself
> 
> and like these huge
> 
> huge bases are really achievements from
> 
> our players
> 
> doing all that stuff and uh it's it's
> 
> scary to remove
> 
> that aspect of the game because that can
> 
> really like optimize out the fun another
> 
> game
> 
> but we know that it's pretty tedious for
> 
> a lot of people to do that stuff so we
> 
> are
> 
> looking into ways to improve it but i
> 
> don't know
> 
> right now what our intentions are um
> 
> but when we hear you like it's it's not
> 
> a it's not like a
> 
> yeah we hear you guys
> 
> uh and i can't mention i can mention
> 
> somebody mentioned like the
> 
> the mods that exist we have looked at
> 
> the mods and we don't really like the
> 
> solution
> 
> um that mods have made
> 
> um because we feel like like i said
> 
> before it really optimized like the mods
> 
> the way they are built right now they
> 
> optimize out the fun out of the game for
> 
> us
> 
> um the way we perceive it and also like
> 
> i know a lot of people gonna be like no
> 
> but a lot of people download the mods
> 
> but
> 
> our core game player base do not
> 
> download those mods um
> 
> so it's it's a it's a shitty answer but
> 
> uh
> 
> yeah it's it's like there's always that
> 
> case when you know we have our opinions
> 
> of what we don't want to do with the
> 
> game and what we think are best for the
> 
> game
> 
> and then you know you guys definitely
> 
> have good suggestions too it's not that
> 
> we're saying like
> 
> our no our mega brains are we're much
> 
> since like our mega brains have the
> 
> right answers
> 
> and like this is how a game is supposed
> 
> to be uh
> 
> every design decision affects a lot of
> 
> the game
> 
> and uh it's it's um
> 
> it's really tricky it's really tricky so
> 
> that's why we're a bit hesitant to just
> 
> like throw in
> 
> you know multi build modes and stuff
> 
> like that
> 
> so yeah
