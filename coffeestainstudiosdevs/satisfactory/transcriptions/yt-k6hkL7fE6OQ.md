> can you uh make modular vehicles
>
> uh i don't think so we're kind of
>
> hesitant about vehicles in general
>
> because vehicles
>
> are very finicky in the game
>
> right now um vehicles are really
>
> expensive
>
> performance wise in the game especially
>
> when you're playing multiplayer
>
> they're also the things that like jank
>
> out the most during dsync stuff that's
>
> because like one of the
>
> most difficult parts of network play in
>
> general
>
> is doing uh like
>
> you cannot like in this is the same in
>
> first person like when you're running
>
> around
>
> uh you cannot send like every single
>
> tick like this is what i'm doing
>
> like on client you have to do prediction
>
> on what's happening
>
> and so what you're said doing is you're
>
> sending like the input
>
> to players saying like hey i'm pressing
>
> up and running this direction
>
> instead of saying like this is where i'm
>
> at in the world and then
>
> server sends that to everyone else and
>
> then try to predict what's going on and
>
> that's one thing on player characters
>
> because they're capsules but on vehicles
>
> is much more complex
>
> because you also have like physics
>
> involving like
>
> you know uh what's it called the spring
>
> whatever like it's much more complicated
>
> on vehicles and
>
> that makes us hesitant to do doom too
>
> much with that
>
> or add new things to that because it
>
> makes things so much harder
>
> to to uh suspension was what i was
>
> looking for it makes things so much
>
> more difficult to implement because of
>
> that so
>
> um i don't think we want to touch too
>
> much on vehicles but
>
> maybe in the future we definitely want
>
> to improve on
>
> vehicles we have some ideas on how to do
>
> that
>
> but we'll probably do that later down
>
> the line
>
> or we might even like outsource that

>
> because there's so much to implement in
