> refined power uh let's see yeah here we
> are
> so i place it over here so there's a mod
> for
> let's see it's here yeah for just a
> bunch of more
> uh power options i know people have been
> asking for like these things like
> windmills
> a lot right so that exists in that mod
> there are like these smaller ones which
> don't generate a lot of electricity um
> these are also like depending on where
> you place them you get more output i
> believe
> uh as far as i can tell because like
> some of these are more efficient than
> others like apple pi five and yeah
> this one's got like three uh and then
> they're
> sorted that out yeah i have no idea
> because i assume there's some like logic
> because i i think like if we want to do
> that we would have to like make some
> world logic you know yeah exactly like
> certain volume or whatever
> it's like on this it's really windy on
> this hill or something
> yeah um and i think that's one one
> reason
> why we just haven't committed too much
> but because like these are fairly much
> just like
> you get free power from them um
> essentially like you just place them and
> you get power
> whereas all everything else like you
> need to do some kind of setup
> in the game all right but these are
> really cool
> uh they said uh faker says the higher
> they are more power you get and they
> need 16 foundations between them so they
> don't reduce the power production ah
> okay yeah there's that and then also
> open the scanning tool for refined power
> open the scanning tool oh oh interesting
> [Music]
> you say wind turbine interesting i have
> wind wristing
> yeah yeah after talking about wind yeah
> winter thing but this is for water uh
> no it's so they have placed something in
> the world for like
> water turbines which is this thing
> which generates water like power from
> water or currents
> and then there's like this thing where
> like automated biomass so you can like
> um you can add a uh
> a conveyable to it what is that which is
> like a effective decision
> we've had to not have but there's a
> monitor is that going to uh the food
> court
> yes it is um
> so yeah there's just a bunch of cool
> alternative power sources
> i also have uh way up here i have solar
> panels
