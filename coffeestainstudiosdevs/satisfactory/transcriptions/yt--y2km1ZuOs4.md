> exactly uh dedicated servers we're still walking working on dedicated service next question uh i know that we've uh i know we say this a lot but like the dedicated servers um is a huge thing to work on for our game specifically um but we are we are working on it it just takes a long time and it also has a lot of technical depth on other systems that we kind of need to implement before we can properly implement dedicated servers that's why it's taking so long because we need we want to take our time working on those systems so that dedicated service makes sense when we release them because we we could technically just like make a shitty version of dedication right now and just put it out there but i don't think um we don't want to do that because i don't think that people are going to be satisfied with the the that solution honestly uh as as like as attractive as that sounds
