>
> to be
>
> of a different feature yeah we can't say
>
> what it is yet yeah
>
> i mean you'll notice when it comes out
>
> or will you
>
> just like like before yeah it's gonna be
>

>
> um so what else yeah i'm
>
> on that's gonna happen um and
>
> you talked about this in the video as
>
> well about um
>
> the release date or whatever or like
>
> rather why we we can't say right now

>
> you said yeah i said
>

>
> like this week's gonna play a big role
>
> however
>
> uh previously we said end of january
>
> beginning of february we can confirm
>
> not end of january um shooting for
>
> beginning of february
>
> uh however as snoop was saying before
>
> that depending on how this goes if
>
> things go poorly we may have to add
>
> one or two weeks or something like that
>
> on there but but that's the time frame
>
> we're looking at it's not
>
> it's not like gonna be delayed a month
>
> and if it's delayed a month oh
>
> it's gonna feel so bad because i just
>
> said this but
>
> i'm 99.9 sure it'll only be a couple
>
> weeks
>
> uh yes so yeah actually i didn't say
>
> that no last time
>
> i was supposed to say this in
>
> yesterday's video and i forgot but
>
> update three will launch
>
> on experimental it will not go to early
>
> access
>
> and the reason is obvious we need people
>
> to test it and to help stabilize it
>
> before it goes to early access so
>
> uh update three will launch there first
>
> um and you know we don't want to launch
>
> it on experimental
>
> early because we want everyone to have
>
> um access to experimental and if we put
>
> it there and then everyone's going to
>
> know what's in it and there won't be
>
> hype for
>
> early access when it goes across or
>
> whatever so yeah this is probably how
>
> we're going to be doing all of our
>
> updates they go to experimental first
>
> and then over to early access it's going
>
> to be very similar to how we did the
>
> last update
>
> because it was the same thing there we
>
> launched it on experimental first just
>
> to make sure that the game is stable for
>
> everyone because like even when we test
>
> ourselves like if we don't find a single
>
> bug which
>
> you know we do but say that we don't
>
> like that doesn't necessarily say that
>
> there aren't bugs in the game
>
> because we have like somewhat like
>
> limited resources in terms of testing we
>
> also have limited resources in terms of
>
> like
>
> proper play time here because like
>
> there's only so many hours in the day
>
> we're so busy doing this um
>
> and we're balancing that we're like
>
> actually implementing stuff so there's
>
> always that that
>
> big unknown uh also we're never gonna be
>
> out of bug test as well as you guys do
>
> yeah i know it's true that's the other
>
> thing like we don't lean on that by any
>
> means but
>
> but like it is it is true like we could
>
> think it's 100 stable
>
> but we would also know that you're going
>
> to find looks yeah but like as soon as
>
> we feel like it's stable we're going to
>
> push it
>
> to early access
