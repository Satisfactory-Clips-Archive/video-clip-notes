> we get paid by the hour let's keep going
>
> all right um yeah so let's keep on
>
> let's keep on trucking and uh talk about
>
> state of dev
>
> um so
>
> i don't know not doing much not just
>
> kidding uh things are
>
> okay here's here's the thing okay we are
>
> just as surprised as you are but so far
>
> everything is on schedule like
>
> yeah it's really great like even the
>
> stream was on schedule
>
> youtube videos beforehand yeah what the
>
> [ __ ] so so
>
> i don't remember if i said last stream
>
> but that that was the first time
>
> since update since the game released
>
> intentionally where we
>
> kept an internal deadline essentially
>
> like
>
> i don't even think the first release was
>
> true because like i think we had an
>
> internal deadline that we also moved
>
> but this is the first time we've hit
>
> like an internal deadline like i know
>
> we've communicated like this is when the
>
> game is coming out
>
> but we've always had like internal
>
> deadlines for like let's try and get it
>
> out for this time and then
>
> we check a few weeks before like is it
>
> doable or not and then we delay it
>
> internally
>
> and then we try to communicate when we
>
> feel like yeah now we know for certain
>
> that we're gonna meet you know whatever
>
> date we say that we're gonna meet but
>
> this time we had an internal deadline
>
> and we completely hit it
>
> like what was that about buy a lottery
>
> ticket that's all i'm gonna say
>
> and this is also the first time where we
>
> kind of like
>
> set up an internal deadline for when we
>
> feel like we're gonna be done with the
>
> experimental branch and move it over to
>
> early access
>
> which we've never done before because
>
> whenever we made something for early
>
> access
>
> or experimental it's it's so random
>
> like what can happen because the the
>
> thing is like it's this is a big topic
>
> but
>
> when we test like we have only so many
>
> hours you know a day
>
> a week where what we that we can spend
>
> on testing stuff like this is
>
> specifically testing this is not fixing
>
> anything right this is a discovery
>
> of issues right and we have a pretty
>
> good track
>
> like of most things and you know
>
> sometimes we ship
>
> an experimental build where we know like
>
> okay there's there's an issue here but
>
> it's okay for experimental so we'll keep
>
> working on that and fix it for early
>
> access
>
> and and there are a few there's always
>
> things that pop up that we don't know so
>
> it's really hard to like estimate say
>
> like
>
> yeah we're gonna we're gonna be we're
>
> gonna fix the bugs
>
> and have it on early access in you know
>
> this amount of weeks
>
> but this time we were like all right
>
> we're hoping for two weeks and
>
> so far so good i'm gonna jinx it
>
> by saying that but so far so good there
>
> are only
>
> two really like major showstoppers
>
> bugs so far on the experimental build
>
> that we
>
> want to fix before moving it over to
>
> early access
>
> and we feel pretty confident that we're
>
> going to be able to do it this week
>
> so hopefully trademark
>
> hopefully the flu is up there we'll go
>
> live on experimental next week
>
> tuesday fingers crossed if anything if
>
> everything goes
>
> according to plan um
>
> and i guess because i say that i'm going
>
> to jinx it but i guess we'll find out
>
> but a lot of people are like speculate
>
> because sometimes we've had games on
>
> early access for a long time
>
> um like i think update three was on
>
> early access
>
> for like two months or something or
>
> because we waited until the steam
>
> release before we put
>
> both versions on early access um
>
> i think that was a little bit of an
>
> exception actually because of
>
> like all the steam stuff that we want to
>
> bake in and make like a one big but then
>
> you got both on early access immediately
>
> um so it really depends on
>
> you know how experimental the actual
>
> build is so we
>
> for this build we specifically didn't
>
> want to make it to
>
> like we didn't add a lot of stuff that
>
> we felt
>
> weren't super confident in so hopefully
>
> we're going to be able to move it over
>
> to earlier
>
> early access next week and then
>
> the schedule as is currently is once
>
> we're going to still keep making patches
>
> for experimental
>
> and then subsequently move them over to
>
> early access when we catch up and fix
>
> them
>
> so the schedule right now and i know i'm
>
> pretty sure we're gonna make a video
>
> about this
>
> uh either next week or like very soon um
>
> is that we're putting
>
> the fluids update on early access after
>
> that we have
>
> a uh an optimization to a
>
> network for conveyor belts specifically
>
> that we want to try out and test
>
> which uh may not necessarily improve
>
> like um the speed of
>
> of how like data transfers specifically
>
> but it will significantly uh improve how
>
> conveyor belts
>
> uh react in multiplayer so we will make
>
> like it less buggy
>
> and desync a little bit less uh if you
>
> will
>
> once that's done we move the over to
>
> early access next patch is the
>
> experimental patch
>
> uh sorry the engine upgrade patch
>
> which will contain a lot of goodies um
>
> some optimization stuff
>
> some network fixes uh i
>
> if i remember correctly some desync
>
> issue fixes uh
>
> potential ones um and that that build is
>
> gonna be
>
> experimental like that's gonna contain a
>
> lot of different like stuff that we've
>
> been trying to fix
>
> um and we're gonna work on that and then
>
> move that over and then we have
>
> uh one more thing that i can't remember
>
> what it is uh that's also optimization
>
> stuff but that's like one specific thing
>
> i think it's convey a belt
>
> network optimization work and then fix
>
> that move that over
>
> and then uh
>
> maybe that's it then it's gonna be
>
> update four i think it's the next thing
>
> after that
>
> so this there's a lot of stuff still
>
> coming this year um on experimental
>
> specifically
>
> um yeah so modular build
>
> is probably the one after uh that one
>
> we might swap those two i'm not sure the
>
> two second and last
>
> two ones but i guess what so we'll we'll
>
> make this way more readable than just me
>
> rambling about it i just want to give it
>
> give you all an update on that generally
>
> there's more stuff coming this year on
>
> experimental so like
>
> it's not gonna be we move over this
>
> build that's on experimental right now
>
> to early access and then it's gonna be
>
> radio silence
>
> until of day four there's gonna be more
>
> stuff
>
> but there's gonna be some really
>
> experimental stuff too so uh
>
> fingers crossed thank god we've got an
>
> experimental branch
>
> hell yeah uh one thing i also would like
>
> to remind everyone this is a bit
>
> unfortunate on the uh the cloud sync
>
> on the epic early access version and the
>
> experimental version
>
> uh they differ so
>
> it's really important if you switch
>
> version that you back up your saves
>
> because you get like a pop-up sometimes
>
> that's like hey
>
> you're there's a mismatch of file
>
> versions
>
> uh if you pick the wrong one you're
>
> gonna sync
>
> like you're old if you've played on x
>
> mantle before you're gonna sync like
>
> your old experimental folder to your
>
> local one
>
> that will overwrite your saves so please
>
> don't do that
>
> make sure to to pick the right option
>
> and back up your saves if you want to
>
> switch over to experimental
>
> because that that is finicky and that's
>
> that's fortunately something we really
>
> don't have control over because that's
>
> that's you know integrated steam and
>
> epic um
>
> so yeah oh boy thanks for coming to my
>
> ted talk
>
> yeah there we are we had one each one a
>
> lot of
>
> a i hope you guys like information
>
> because there's plenty of it here
>
> yep
