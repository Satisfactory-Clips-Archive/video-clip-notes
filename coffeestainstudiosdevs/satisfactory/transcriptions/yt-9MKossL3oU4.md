> 
> at some point it's like it's a card
>

> fix it and stuff like that so like once
> 
> times freeze up like their list will
>

> 
> that's been the issue right because like
> 
> while we're developing new things and
> 
> this is part of the the
> 
> the issue of development processes
> 
> like we we have like a list of things we
> 
> want to work on right
> 
> for each person and then we work on
> 
> those things and then as we're
> 
> developing new things
> 
> for like the next updates then we're
> 
> like all right let's let's implement
> 
> an update to fluids and then we're like
> 
> all right but
> 
> that's more prio than fixing these bugs
> 
> so then you get new tasks
> 
> on top of those tasks and it just keeps
> 
> going like that and some tasks
> 
> have like some bug fixes have been like
> 
> yeah it's maybe a minute or something to
> 
> fix it but it just
> 
> the their other prior things just keeps
> 
> happening
> 
> um so but that was one of the things
> 
> cause i
> 
> i was like my my time my time was
> 
> running out
> 
> as a programmer and i had like a bunch
> 
> of free time so i was like i'm just
> 
> gonna fix a bunch of small bugs
> 
> uh and i did fix a bunch of small bugs
> 
> that a lot of people were happy about
> 
> uh i fixed like a bunch of the train
> 
> bugs where like you can
> 
> build trains as clients and stuff like
> 
> that that was low prio for some reason
> 
> uh so i got that done but then i was
> 
> going to do the the resource thing and i
> 
> didn't do it
>
