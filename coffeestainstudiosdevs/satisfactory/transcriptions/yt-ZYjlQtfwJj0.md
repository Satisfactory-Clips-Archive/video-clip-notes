> um will when you extract nitrogen will
> 
> you attract more monsters or alien
> 
> creatures
> 
> i actually talked um to stefan or
> 
> current ceo or new ceo about that today
> 
> because he was kind of thinking that it
> 
> would be interesting if you start like
> 
> blasting away with this record that
> 
> creatures in the area get kind of
> 
> annoyed and they come towards that
> 
> location
> 
> but for now we don't have any strict
> 
> plans for that so maybe that's something
> 
> that we want to look into
> 
> in the future i think for some players
> 
> that will be interesting for others they
> 
> will think it's really annoying so
> 
> yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't bet on it for
> 
> now that's something that we will do
> 
> i guess if we did do it it would make
> 
> sense to like add pacifist mode maybe
> 
> yeah i mean that's something we want to
> 
> do anyway yeah so
> 
> if we have that option it might be more
> 
> valid to start doing more aggressive
> 
> things
> 
> uh with the with the game world as well
> 
> but until then i wouldn't really want to
> 
> push this kind of things into the game
> 
> because it will just piss off a lot of
> 
> players yeah
> 
> more fun for a large part of our player
> 
> base
> 
> it's a very tricky balance you guys uh
> 
> with the whole thing i know it's a meme
> 
> now when everyone asks me about tower
> 
> defense
> 
> but um it is it's a tricky balancing
> 
> thing because a lot of people play the
> 
> game
> 
> and they don't like the the
> 
> [Music]
> 
> the the combat aspect of the game at all
> 
> like there are even
> 
> i've seen posts on steam where people
> 
> are like unless unless you have a
> 
> passive mode i'm not buying this game
> 
> like and then there's the other cam
> 
> that's like
> 
> if you don't add tower defense i'm not
> 
> buying this game so like it's a really
> 
> tricky balance there
> 
> uh if you did do something like that
> 
> where like yeah when you start
> 
> extracting nitrogen then suddenly you
> 
> kind of do get attacked which
> 
> no other building does in the game so
> 
> far um and i mean we have
> 
> plans to add like the you know the crab
> 
> boss feature thing
> 
> at some point which i don't know i'm not
> 
> sure exactly how that would work or like
> 
> how that would
> 
> behave in the world if that will have a
> 
> big impact or not um so there's still
> 
> like
> 
> the game is still in early access it's
> 
> still gonna change but we do we do hear
> 
> the people that
> 
> we do listen to everyone and like we
> 
> want to retain the game
> 
> correct me if i'm wrong mark but we do
> 
> want to retain the game as it is now so
> 
> that you don't feel like if you play the
> 
> game when it was released in early
> 
> access that it's a
> 
> completely different experience when it
> 
> actually
> 
> we hit 1.0
