> somebody asked about mark two factory
>
> buildings
>
> and the we've said before we're not
>
> gonna have that
>
> would you like to elaborate on why that
>
> is mark yeah because they
>
> yeah probably most people know of this
>
> because they were either in the engine
>
> or just because they thought it was
>
> i mean it's not a bad idea because it
>
> kind of limits the object amount and
>
> especially in late game you need so many
>
> items that
>
> uh it helps a lot to just have faster
>
> production potentially that way
>
> i scrapped them because i didn't feel
>
> like that was a good investment over
>
> time because if we want an mk2
>
> constructor
>
> we probably want to make it look
>
> different somehow and that's again more
>
> work that we need to do
>
> so i would rather invest that time into
>
> trying to make
>
> the overclocking for example better or
>
> having different ways that we can amp up
>
> production in a similar fashion that
>
> is potentially both nicer to use and
>
> uh more resource efficient from our side
>
> when we actually produce it
>
> and we have some solutions on that and
>
> we're actually gonna
>
> try to investigate that as well when the
>
> time
>
> arises but i've planned it in for
>
> 1.0 although not very specifically
>
> but it's something that i want to look
>
> at yeah but that's why we don't want to
>
> do the mk2s because it's just yeah
>
> it would be a lot of work to to keep the
>
> standards that we have for
>
> our production uh for all those kind of
>
> new buildings
>
> yeah it's also like how
>
> how many buildings like would that mean
>
> every single building is a mark two
>
> like that's a lot of rework or not
>
> rework but like a lot of
>
> a lot of work yeah there's just
>
> generally better solutions like the
>
> overclocking or alternate recipes we
>
> could
>
> rethink that a bit as well if we really
>
> want to achieve that hmm
