> um any mods you want to add to vanilla at some stage i'm sure there are mods that i'm sure there are things that we already thought about that there's a mod for currently um and um look guys like we worked in this game for a long time and uh we've had the opportunity to think about this game a lot so drones for instance was something that we've like thought about before we we released this game okay uh and it's been our like backlog since then um and and and obviously when when there's a mod for something that we've like thought about but not like released that's a good sign that like this is probably good feature to implement um so uh so yeah that be like it do lights is another thing lights was actually implemented in the game uh before it was it was out if you remember the stream me and jace did where we played the old version of the game that had lights that version had lights so it's been in the game since then and and at that point lights weren't that good for the game they didn't run that well um and that's why we didn't release the game with lights uh but now we're at the point where we feel confident with our solution for lights there's still i think a little bit tweaking left to do with the lights but we as far as i know i it looks pretty good and they work pretty well um also saw the street lights and the alpha screenshots yeah and i think i think people also data mined like the uh the lights out of the game uh so you know this was coming okay and we knew it was coming and it's it's here now so good times were had by all
