### Transcript

> uh can you talk about plans for replayability um well this game but even after full release and doing everything i'd like to keep playing it with so many new experiences each time well so with the full release you'll we will have a semi-new experience in that there will be a story and you can finish the game so like that might be refreshing but in terms of replayability i don't really know what plans are for that there's a lot of things that uh you know one one thing that we've been talking about is game modes that might add to replayability which might i don't know there are a bunch of plans i can't really talk about them because a lot of the plans are just ideas they're not they're not plans like there aren't plans yet there's just a bunch of ideas and it's just something that we haven't um started to tackle yet necessarily but also people playing hundreds if not thousands of hours of our game so i don't know how much replayability issue there is like even one playthrough of the game is like 100 hours at least right probably more like my playthrough is 98 hours or something like that and i'm not necessarily the quickest player but um i really don't think the game i personally don't think the game suffers from a replayability issue or replayability maybe but game time issue no if anything it takes a hell of a lot of time to to make certain things to just get through once like if you pay 30 dollars for a game and you play for 200 hours yeah to get through it once or 150 hours like there isn't there isn't a game duration problem and you had a hundred hours minimum and you had like fun doing that it wasn't just like a chore you just decided no i'm gonna finish this game for whatever or or i'm not satisfactory feels like work no i mean it kind of is but some people like that yeah i know um three and a half thousand hours that day so it's really it's crazy so it's really different like it varies a lot for people people like how much worth they're getting like do people get the same worth for their same 100 hours or whatever you know what i mean like it's hard to answer that question but we don't have any indication that replayability is like an issue for us right now yeah

> um obviously there are there's some a bunch of obvious things that can already be done and i like i spoke i spoke to mark about it like a quite a long time ago and like of course that's the director of course he's thought about it and he has a bunch of ideas so oh daf emotes um so i think replayability stuff will will happen in the future i just don't know what it is and i don't know when and i also don't think the game necessarily needs it but it'll probably still come anyway
