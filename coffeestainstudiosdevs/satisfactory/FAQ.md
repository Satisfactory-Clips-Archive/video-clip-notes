<summary>A transcript is available</summary>

> uh blueprints when maybe it is uh i think it's actually super important i know that we've had a lot of discussion and i i don't think everyone maybe agrees with me within the studio but recently i had a talk with one of our ui ux designers and he had another concept for it which i think is very promising how we could do it because it's always been an issue as well of like how do we technically approach it and what is the design id behind it do we just allow copy pasting of everything that way can you make your own building setups and save them do we have slots for it that are specific sizes it's all these different kind of questions and then comes the issue that we've always discussed like doesn't it just kind of defeat the point because then you're just constantly copying pasting everything um i'm not too worried about the whole copy-pasting thing i think it's a great addition because this game requires a lot of repetition and we already know that people just they're going to build big anyway we're not really going to stop them that way and it's yeah i don't know i just think it's a must and it's on our internal uh road map wow at least look into it so we have planned for it it's just the question of how we're going to do it and i mean i guess it's still the question if we're going to do it but i'm pretty sold on it oh wow oh wow what a turning point so yeah we'll see what happens you guys i'm i'm still like scared because the fact that people are going to hit the object limit and stuff like that is always looming but there are certainly to make that better yeah sure there's all but there's always like there are certain aspects where it's just really frustrating to build in certain cases where you need to repeat like specifically like if you make a big um what's the term like if you have a factory layout that you you have a lot of repetitions in the build of it it's like it takes a lot of time to just like place the splitter hook it up with the conveyor belts and then you're like oh i need put the wrong order and you remove the very belts and they hook it back up again and then you find like i used the wrong conveyor belt for this one and i can't because it's so tight i can't remove it i have to remove the splitter and that is connected with a bunch of papers as well so like there there are cases where i definitely can see that that is very useful and you don't build like that very often where you need to like um when you have like those very complex setups of factory buildings that are connected in a certain way um so i can definitely see a use case there but i'm the one i'm most scared about as a programmer is probably the one where if you have a lot of foundations and you can just like build at infinite
>

> but yeah cool yeah definition bennis actually told me that the foundation thing is really not the biggest problem when it comes to object count yeah and i don't know building a lot of foundations i think shouldn't really be the the hard part of building a factory it's always going to be and the fun part as well as building the buildings right the building the foundations is just the starting point yeah so i i personally don't really agree with the argument that we should limit that because it's i don't know like it's not meaningful to build a lot of foundations unless you try to make something really pretty out of it but then i would rather have people build specific uh cosmetic things to make the factory pretty yeah i don't even buy one i don't know if ben has seen the factors where people literally fill the entire world with foundations uh yeah but that's more of like an outside tool issue as well right with like if you build the round foundations using the online tool uh a lot of them end up underneath the map i think was an issue right that kind of stuff but apparently the biggest issue is actually the buildings themselves because they have so many components to them so one one constructor is not actually just one building it has a lot of different objects inside of it uh that count towards subject limit as well and he has actually been doing really good work reducing that so we we are reaching higher levels of maximum and allowed objects effectively because we're reducing the amount of objects in every single building so the future is bright you guys my god 2021 is gonna be the year at least it's brighter

> we'll see uh console port we don't have plans for console at the moment and the reason for that is because we're focusing on pc after 1.0 maybe we'll we'll look into it but then we have so many like uh ux issues that we need to solve to work with the controller because we don't have full control of support currently and that would be something we would have to have and that i don't know how we would solve that currently so that's a huge task undertaking um so yeah the ps5 was a plug was a joke uh a lot of people really wanted on console though so i totally understand why people ask that question

> and like stuff like dlss which we we don't we don't have it on the current correct engine version right now so we can't upgrade to 426 we are kind of debating right now whether we want to upgrade to 426 i think we're gonna do it um but it's the update to 425 was really like took a lot of effort and it introduced a bunch of issues that uh didn't exist in the previous version that we still haven't solved yet so it's a it's a very big commitment to upgrade the engine version because we don't know what happens um so i'm not sure what's going to happen there but we'll find it in the future but there are a few things that are like really good in 426 that i think we want so i don't know we'll see

> um do you think we'll rework radar towers in what sense like are we happy because that's a pretty good point too are we happy with the the way the map works in the game with like the exploration aspects of it i think we could do a lot more with it uh also the radar tower if you think from a purely gameplay perspective then i think there could be more benefits to having it uh and the map has always been the suspension point of like we kind of wanted in the mam but then you also as a new player you don't even know that it's there uh how do you know where to get the map maybe it's just something that we should give by default or it should be way clearer that you can get it in that quartz research somehow uh there's different things there but yeah i want to do more with the map in general as well wait do you not get the map from from the map right now yeah you do yeah okay i was like oh yeah yeah yeah you get in the quartz research pretty pretty easily but the problem is that generally you don't know that it's there you have to know yeah i've seen a bunch of people are like hey why do i not have the map yet and it's like because you haven't researched it that's true yeah maybe that's one of those things you don't want to put behind a progression wall like that where yeah uh raider towers have no use uh i guess they help you like what do they actually do i've never used onex they reveal parts of the map yeah that's it right yeah because we have to think they could do more yeah we have talked about like maybe being able to like scout on the map stuff because you have the like an upgrade to your uh object scanner because right now the obvious scanner is just like it just looks so the closest one in proximity whereas the radar tower could be more like in this area you can find that's pretty cool though like you get an area of effect on the map where an object is i was also thinking it could just constantly show you what resources are within its radius so you don't have to constantly scan for them to see them that kind of becomes an issue of course with the compass but i think we can figure something out for that yeah that would already make it more practical another suggestion i think that burke gave me a while back was that if we do the logic system or the circuit system however you want to call it that could be a really cool use as well for the raider tower to potentially send data from those kind of systems over longer distances to other parts of the factory right so there is some more potential for them i think both with the map and other features that we might want to add

> [Music]

> that was um yeah it was a big topic on the the content list that i initially had it's actually one of the things that we have pushed back because of the sheer size of it because if we're gonna do it i would want to do it like properly like big farming uh there's a lot of potential i think the main problem that i see but it's either to be a complete side show where you you don't really need to do it which just as well maybe but then it's not as high priority or we make it part of the main progression like this alternate path to getting certain uh recipes going right um if we do it the way that i want to do it it becomes a huge huge thing huge consideration and if we don't do it that way i'm not too interested in it i think with the mall already being there even though i think that it's not fully going anymore from understood from ben which is kind of sad but um it's currently not one of our priorities to have that for 1.0 so of course the question is always will it be there for after 1.0 uh that might be the case it really depends on what we want to do at that point but yeah 1.0 don't expect it it's not going to be there pretty sure

> don't get oh actually one question that i haven't seen today but i've seen it a lot of time before is is adding a truck that can transfer fluids we have it for trains but we don't have it with trucks what's the thought there uh that was a conscious decision and i don't remember why i mean what's the big limitation when we did update three of course was that it's a shitload of work to make all those new assets for like a truck with a fluid container yeah so we went the whole packaging way where you could do that by packaging stuff right that's also where we made packaging more spacious space efficient uh but also we kind of wanted to see if people would just make long pipelines would that be super annoying we never really followed up on that properly uh which is something that we should do yeah it would be fun uh just work and i'm not sure if it's actually necessary cool

> somebody asked about mark two factory buildings and the we've said before we're not gonna have that would you like to elaborate on why that is mark yeah because they yeah probably most people know of this because they were either in the engine or just because they thought it was i mean it's not a bad idea because it kind of limits the object amount and especially in late game you need so many items that uh it helps a lot to just have faster production potentially that way i scrapped them because i didn't feel like that was a good investment over time because if we want an mk2 constructor we probably want to make it look different somehow and that's again more work that we need to do so i would rather invest that time into trying to make the overclocking for example better or having different ways that we can amp up production in a similar fashion that is potentially both nicer to use and uh more resource efficient from our side when we actually produce it and we have some solutions on that and we're actually gonna try to investigate that as well when the time arises but i've planned it in for 1.0 although not very specifically but it's something that i want to look at yeah but that's why we don't want to do the mk2s because it's just yeah it would be a lot of work to to keep the standards that we have for our production uh for all those kind of new buildings yeah it's also like how how many buildings like would that mean every single building is a mark two like that's a lot of rework or not rework but like a lot of a lot of work yeah there's just generally better solutions like the overclocking or alternate recipes we could rethink that a bit as well if we really want to achieve that hmm

> too fast i can't read like this so so one question i've gotten actually a lot is mark six belts what's the what's the state with that oh that was actually a talking point that i had when it came to the balancing because a bunch of issues that we currently have and that we're dealing with uh i think i mentioned that we're like kind of looking towards that future balance so that certain things might feel currently out of place because they're actually made with like future implementation of certain things in mind like the fact that we have might have more nitrogen the mk6 build is actually part of that because it will greatly improve the amount of uh raw resources that you can get per minute because you're currently you're limited uh when extracting from pure nodes with mk3 miners fully overclocked you cannot get the max amount of resources exactly uh uh yeah i mean from my perspective this is still planning and i think we have solutions for the main problem that i've always heard was that it's just too fast yeah because isn't there like there's i think there's a technical thing as well where precision is kind of lost on the faster belts as well right now so we need to fix that system if we're going to support faster belts yeah and i think but i i think i was told that it's it's also just uh showing them visually or something or being able to i don't remember because there was a solution where if we just made the belts basically a pipe so you can't actually see the items it would it would be fine so you do like a little thing over it like a protective casing uh and you say like yeah they're in there there's so many items underneath that casing but they wouldn't be there but that would allow for the speed apparently because i've also asked like can we just have two outputs down on the miner but apparently that's actually more expensive than just having one belt really with it at least if i remember correctly that's what i was told when i yeah i know asking for that oh i didn't think of that yeah that's true actually it up you probably know more about that than i do the complications yeah there's like uh there's it's twofold because it also it has one to do with threading we won't be able to thread the same like it's already an issue kind of on the the boxes storage containers um because they also have two input outputs um yeah we don't need to talk too much about that but yeah that's a good point we could have just story say that like it's it's a vacuum tube and it's shooting items in the vacuum or something like that and that's why it's like a quantum conveyor yeah exactly um except to start at the end at the same time

> power um multiple body slots when yes maybe maybe uh yeah we've talked about a lot of different solutions and you've talked about this a bunch on here as well generally we do want to support it it's just uh the problem before for me has always been that we don't have enough different types of equipments which kind of makes a lot of challenges that we can apply with exploration super redundant because we don't have the tools to then challenge the player anymore right when they have a jet pack and a gas mask and the blade runners but i don't think the general idea of having those things on at the same time is an issue so i think we want to support it if that is from multiple body slots or maybe combining equipment together at certain points in the game so we can maybe control it a bit better that way as well i don't really know yet we have been talking about it a lot there's a lot of different ways on how to do this but it kind of comes down for me at least to the idea that we need more types of equipments so that you can actually have different things in your head slot if you could only have the gas mask there it would be a bit meh so i want more different types of equipments to really make this a proper thing and then of course more things that actually require you to have those equipments and want to use them and swap around sometimes not constantly run around with the same stuff on your body gotcha one other thing that you pointed out before as well that was pretty interesting i haven't thought about it was that the world is kind of designed around the fact that you have one body slot that you use at the same time so like when you're in gas you won't need the jump uh the jet pack to be able to like get around the the world puzzles that we have in those locations and i guess the world does will need some redesign if we're gonna have more than one body slot for those cases yeah that's a big problem like you said like you could have a jump also that has gas on it specifically to stop you from using the jet jetpack to get onto it or make you think in a more creative way of how you can either build your way up or get to get there with the jetpack from like a different point but that would kind of be ruined of course if you can have them both at the same time than the whole gym person just gets completely destroyed right

> so wind power mark when no
>
> [Laughter]
>
> um what is the what is the reasoning why we don't want to add wind wind power or solar power or stuff like that uh i think both of those have the problem where that you can effectively even if you make a system around it that kind of checks for uh certain restrictions that you can just build them everywhere of course they would still effectively be limitless in in this game i think uh and we don't really want that for power like you could just build a giant solar panel field and not have to worry about the power at all which kind of defeats the point of the power system where it's supposed to be a pain in your butt every now and then and you're supposed to want to fix it and make it all run smoothly and i feel that that those kind of power supplies would take away from it because they don't have enough limitations that we can effectively uh contain the balancing off gotcha remember we we also brought up like water turbines yeah i think those will be more in the realm of what the the geysers now do yeah and right now the guys have the issue where some people actually brought this up where they feel kind of what kind of they're super weak for when you get them the amount of power that you get from them uh so we might change it as well but for the yeah water turbines i would be more interested in them because you would have to place them potentially on fast flowing rivers or waterfalls which are a limited resource so to say in the world which is more interesting in my opinion because it kind of gets you around like you can't just pop them down anywhere you actually have to find a waterfall we get up a cliff to get to the waterfall place them there connecting to your factory i think it's a more interesting way to approach power with a bit of a challenge like that than just to give a building that just produces it out of thin air gotcha free power when do we get free power

> uh can we just finally sleep in the hub i don't think we're ever gonna add that to be honest maybe we'll do like you can lay down in the hub or something but the the biggest gripe we have with sleeping in the hub is the fact that all the stuff inside a factory is like depending on time all right i don't know if you guys heard that my neighbor is screwing around um we don't want we can't really add like fast forwarding stuff like that to the game because of a few reasons the main one being that you would speed up your factories and that would we don't like that for two reasons one is because you would be able to like quote unquote cheat you know speed up your time and be able to get around that uh it also messes with the like it kind of optimizes away the fun of automation in a sense because it can lead to a lot of cases where people don't auto like don't learn automation just because they can sleep uh throughout time and just like make small things and don't expand their builds and stuff like that we already have that problem a little bit with the workbench in early game where if you don't realize that you should automate you can just go back to the workbench over and over and keep uh manually grafting and that's that's an issue we've had since day one it's an issue we don't really have a solution for and we don't want to introduce something else that adds on top of that uh the second thing is that um we it's a technical thing as well with speeding up the game because if we do we can't like it's it's it's a really tr tough problem to solve if we were to say like all right it's now 1 pm i wanna i want to load the game at 6 pm because we need to simulate everything that goes on in between that time and depending on your base that can be very very very expensive so what can happen is you go to bed and then the game crash like it seems like the game is crashing because it needs to simulate and that's a problem we just like don't want to focus on right now so we we're probably not going to introduce sleeping in the hub i know that it's frustrating that we do have like the mattresses there but maybe we'll we'll do something else with those in the future or something just so they make sense or maybe we'll just remove them but i don't think we're going to do that i think we're going to do something else with them that's a little bit more fun um yeah just just do like a sleeping animation but you don't actually go to bed or something like that

> satisfactory roadmap we don't really have a roadmap because it's we had a roadmap and uh we didn't like it we we roadmap this is a huge topic on roadmaps but the problem with road maps for us is that we we can't like obviously we're committed with working on the game but we can't commit to a roadmap to the extent that we need like if we need to crunch at some point to meet deadlines we're not gonna we need to delay and i think it's a little bit frustrating for everyone when we're constantly delaying stuff um i think this dev cycle that we've had last year has been really good for for both of us uh both for you guys and for us just because like we've had time to do the things we want to do we haven't been stressing about like we need to do this we need to do this we need to get this out and like our decisions are based on you know what's best for the game rather than when is this coming out um and that's we want to keep doing that that's one reason the other reason is that we're constantly changing our minds based on you know when we're prototyping stuff and realize this isn't a good idea or when we produce yourself and realize ooh what if we did it this way instead and change our minds on certain things we want to be able to do that still and it's also so that we can kind of react to what you guys are doing saying to us so for instance pipes would not have been possible if we would have kept our roadmap going pipes would not have happened at that point so yeah we really want to keep that agile development going and not get stuck in like the the world map kind of thinking i know that's really frustrating to hear because obviously you want to know like what's coming and what to look forward to and you know if you know that like oh i'm really looking forward to this thing that's going to come in this part of the year like we're going to try and like be as open about development as we can we've been fairly open in for update four saying what's going to come but we're going to try and be even more open and let you guys know what's kind of in the pipeline what might change keep you in the loop et cetera et cetera we're going to figure sing things out that way instead of you know having a static road map on the on the on the uh on the website or something like that because you feel like also doing that way this kind of communication where we have our streams we have a youtube channel we have you know our twitter and stuff like that um it gives us a better way to like keep keep engaged with you guys as well so that we don't become you know boomer game developers that just like we're just gonna do this thing and we're so set on it we want to like be able to do what makes sense for the game and what makes the game better um and we feel like a road map is a little bit hindering us in that sense roman is a joke and burns all devs yeah it can't it can do that there are way i think there are ways to do to have road maps that kind of work and we've also talked a lot about having like some middle ground where maybe we'll do like a white board or something like that showing like this is what we're looking to implement at some point but we don't know when um and maybe like that will also be easier to like confirm like these are the things that we confirm want to have in satisfactory but even those things can change like there might be things that we feel like this needs to be in the game but then maybe we aren't able to implement it so and that can also be very frustrating so it's a tricky it's a tricky situation we're trying our best to to figure out what to do about that as we go but working on the game making the game as best as it can be is the priority for us so really sorry that that answer got so long but we really want to make the game the best it can be and sometimes we need to take decisions that suck for you guys but in the long haul i think will be better for you guys uh in that sense so all right got that out of the way

> what's the feature you wanna add to this so i personally really wanna improve the build modes uh i there are there are a lot i think we talked about this last week as well there are a few um there are a few things that really annoy me when you're building and i think there are somewhat easy to fix and they will improve building immensely so i would love to to improve some of those things first and foremost and maybe like a global grid situation but also like how you place you know um mergers and splitters i think that's one of the like places mergers and splitters uh not the fact that they don't clip on foundations when you're dragging them i'm already placed um conveyor belts and stuff like that i think that's really annoying uh stuff like you know the what are they called the the pipe connector thingies i can't remember what they're called that they rotate too i think they rotate too freely i want them to be able to clip snap it a bit better the snapping system we have for the guidelines thing when the green lines show up when you hold control that's a prototype that's not done at all um that's a prototype i made and then we're like alright i just put in the game whatever it works pipe junction thank you uh i want i want better clipping and like snapping with that so if you're if you're one of those people that like builds very methodically it just makes it so much easier to build because i think the addition of the the hover pack makes things so much better in the game i think the hover pack is like one of the best items in the game right now um so improving the the build modes would make the game a ton better imo god i love the hover pack i know it's so good right

> what's the object so i again i i say this every time and i know i'm not going to be able to to um educate enough people so that this this will change but it's it's not an object limit you guys it's a memory limit it's a memory limit of how many objects the engine can keep track of at a time and it's not an object in terms of like physical objects in the world it's memory allocated memory like spaces and those are referred to as memory objects because of programming paradigms it's it's it's memory objects not game objects a game object can have many memory objects and a game object can have n number of memory objects so it's not one to one either so but the limit is like something two million u objects that's why i always like i want to point out that it's you object not object limits um and i've explained this a billion times and it's it's it really isn't if you're not a programmer this doesn't make sense because of the way we it's a linguistic thing the way we describe it um the fact that we we need programming we kind of need to like create physical things to talk about we need to anthropomorphize some things because it makes makes it easier to talk about things and that's kind of like kind of up when we talk about this thing yeah i'm a programmer it makes a perfect sense yeah but the people that aren't programmers it doesn't make sense so people think oh object limit that must be game objects but that's not the case so that's why it's kind of confusing um because we can't change the the u object limit we can't optimize for it so potentially you could if you build like x amount of objects and it crashes the game and hit that limit we could optimize it so that you could potentially load that game again without changing the limit yeah it's an engine limit and another thing to point out as well it's an engine limit but you can technically increase it if you go to the config files but we don't recommend that because we don't know what happens if you do you can get very weird memory issues uh when you play the game and it can be as bad as it corrupts your save file and it in fact has happened for people so we know it can happen um that's why we don't recommend it if you do want if you have built a base that's so big that you hit that limit then what you can do is back up your save file then go into the config files and change it but be aware that that may cause issues down the line and if we do optimize the game further down the line where the limit is better the config files will not get overridden so your manual change of the config files will still persist and you could potentially be playing a version of the game where we've fixed most of those issues and you get a corrupt save file and that sucks so that's why we're really clear about the fact that there is a way for you but we don't recommend it because it could cause issues uh so you're you're 100 on your own if you if you do that but we we are not stopping you you're free to do whatever you want there but just know that this is a complicated problem so re like really read up on it um before doing anything and read up on it means listen to us don't listen to community community because this is like super construed what people think the problem is and what the solution is and the idea of how it works like there are i think we've put out some video about it somewhere around where you can quote that or maybe we should make a video about it or something i don't know it's kind of scary also because we don't want you guys to like build in a certain way that like is optimized because that's not fun it's uh it's on us to make the game fit your play needs you know it shouldn't be the other way around maybe it's it's the other way around for now because we're still optimizing the game and the game isn't done and if you want to like keep playing maybe you need to but it shouldn't be on you guys it should be on us to fix those kind of things all right i always get so flushed when i talk about this but it's just like it's it's a it's a it's a little bit frustrating for me because it's so misconstrued in community people talk about it in one way but it doesn't work that way um and it's just really hard to get that information out because it's a complicated subject and there's no like easy easy way to explain it i think um so i can only keep trying but i'm also okay with it the fact that like this is the way you get as a community manager like you never reach everyone there's always going to be misconceptions about everything so uh but yeah i'll i'll keep explaining it as many times as i as i need to uh for as long as that problem exists i don't mind it um we just gotta keep doing our best you know

> will there be stories of the game yes there will be stories of the game in in 1.0 we're going to unveil the entire story i've i've talked about this many times but i'll i'll do a revamp here so the way the the way our story is going to be implemented is um we're not going to go down the route that like subnautica did with like introducing story segments one one by a time like one one by one and in early access we'd rather do the entire story so you can like play throughout the entire story in one go and you know enjoy that story is always going to be kind of like not maybe not optional but it's going to be something that you don't like you can play the game totally without playing the story essentially so you're not like missing anything by playing the game in early access right now story-wise so it's gonna make sense anyways to to implement it late and the story's gonna be really late it's gonna be the last thing we add to the game when we launch it 1.0 um but you can still yeah it's not i don't think it's going to maybe we'll change our minds later down the line but currently it's not going to be like a mandatory thing that like takes up your focus to play throughout the game you're going to be able to play the game regardless

> um any mods you want to add to vanilla at some stage i'm sure there are mods that i'm sure there are things that we already thought about that there's a mod for currently um and um look guys like we worked in this game for a long time and uh we've had the opportunity to think about this game a lot so drones for instance was something that we've like thought about before we we released this game okay uh and it's been our like backlog since then um and and and obviously when when there's a mod for something that we've like thought about but not like released that's a good sign that like this is probably good feature to implement um so uh so yeah that be like it do lights is another thing lights was actually implemented in the game uh before it was it was out if you remember the stream me and jace did where we played the old version of the game that had lights that version had lights so it's been in the game since then and and at that point lights weren't that good for the game they didn't run that well um and that's why we didn't release the game with lights uh but now we're at the point where we feel confident with our solution for lights there's still i think a little bit tweaking left to do with the lights but we as far as i know i it looks pretty good and they work pretty well um also saw the street lights and the alpha screenshots yeah and i think i think people also data mined like the uh the lights out of the game uh so you know this was coming okay and we knew it was coming and it's it's here now so good times were had by all

> do we have any holiday themed plans in the future uh no not right now um i know we want to do at some point but i don't know what we this it takes a lot of planning to do it so we need to at least like three months before we do it we need to know that we're doing it um so no idea maybe we'll do like uh in my head this is my reasoning here you guys this isn't our this isn't confident reasoning but in my head it would make sense if we did like a halloween thing this year and like do one event every year until we're like 1.0 because then you get like and then restart the events every year so you'd get like all the events i mean it would be for new players there would be a lot of new events if they play but for you guys it would be the same event essentially but you'd always get like at least one new thing every year uh i think that would be cool but that's that's my guessing i don't think that's actually what we're planning for but i think i personally i think that would be cool we'll see what happens

> is it possible to have steam workshop in the game uh it's possible but i don't know if we're gonna go that down that route honestly because we have modding that's like on both epic and on steam we've had mod modding and epic for a long time and then we'll be released on steam the modders had to like make it so that it works on steam as well and it's a kind of generic system right now with the mod loader and if we were to implement you know steam workshop or stuff like that then we want to support that just equally as much on the epic side of things and if i don't know how that's going to affect the ecosystem of mods currently um and we feel the way we feel is that we love our modding community we think they're great uh we are constantly amazed by by the work that's put in there and we don't want to that up we don't want to make mods harder to make for the modding community and we don't want to add like extra work to them because they're already putting so much work into it we wanted to make it seamless for the mod creators as well so we're in this together you guys um so we need to figure out a solution that works for everyone uh does that mean that we'll use mod workshop or epic's version of mod whatever it's called i can't remember that they released um or if we make like an in-game version i don't know but we'll certainly we certainly care about the monarch community currently um and we certainly don't want to make it harder for them uh if anything we want to make it easier for them to make mods um so that's kind of why um why be like that with that being said mods no i'm just kidding cheaters oh we made the game in a certain way you just want to cheat it out of the way what the i can't believe you guys shame shame ugh all mods are cheap yeah oh we love you guys we love that we are we're constantly amazed by the the modding community and uh the people working on the tools that support the modding community you guys are the real mep

<summary>A transcript is available</summary>

> um so are you pack packing the update 4 to an engine upgrade um so yeah um the engine upgrade won't go to early access before update 4 comes to early access so we will keep the engine upgrade on experimental branch as update 4 drops and then we're going to keep working on that until we feel that they both work and the main reason for that is because we there were a few like things that got way better for some people with the engine upgrade but some larger factory lines and stuff like that didn't get better um they got worse um so and that's annoying we don't want to like push the upgrade that can result in some people playing in early access getting a worse experience we would rather fix those issues before we do that and we don't have time to do that before update 4 launches so that's why we're doing it this way

> are there limited lizard doggers on the map i don't know are there limited ones um the way they work is like they have a spawn thingamajig and it's like random how many can spawn at each spawn point or something uh and i don't know if this is how it works but i think it's like if you spawn one lizard doggo then it won't spawn another one until that one dies or something like that so if there's a spawn point where there potentially could spawn two lizard doggos the other one won't spawn until one of them dies or something like that so technically they're gonna start murdering the doggers to get it more favorable no no i am i'm down for that i am i i can i can get send their corpses to me yeah yeah i'll i'll pile on them uh so technically i guess there's a limited amount of this list of doggos i think if i understood the system correctly the way it was described to me um i found a spot there was like five lizard dragons there's a there's a secret cave with a bunch of lizard doggos that's called the lizard doggo cave um so if you find that happy times let the slaughtering commence

> does obscuring belts actually help with performance uh it kind of depends um we have tested it and you do get a little bit of gain i think um the thing you sacrifice when you obscure the items is like clarence uh sorry not clearance um clarence clarence like uh what's the word like the it becomes less clear what's going on like uh it's harder to play the game so while you gain a little bit of performance it makes the game a little bit harder to play so we've thought of like adding something for people that need it or want it or something like that where you can like optionally do it i don't know if that's when that's gonna happen or if it's gonna happen or if it's just like a prototyping thing we did and just feel like nah it wasn't good but we have tried that at least

> oh oops uh is the game going to have a big story it's going to have a story and you can finish the game um but like i mean what what's a big story i don't know it depends on what you think but uh the story will will always be sort of like supplemental to the game right because the the main point of the game is to build factory and stuff so if you don't really want to do the story stuff the way we're going to make it is that um you know you don't really have to if you don't want to but but there'll be a story for those who want to chase it and follow the narrative and finish the game

> mass foundation creation um mark talked about this a while ago like before holiday vacation um where we oh maybe this was a video that jace put out but we talked about essentially that we are kind of considering you know doing some kind of um not blueprints but like some kind of similar system or or something that makes sense in our game we don't think that blueprints by like the way the blueprints are like implemented in other games like factorio we don't think that makes sense in our game but we are looking into you know some kind of similar system to that to make late game building more enjoyable as you as you may know we're still done not done with the game there's still a lot of stuff to do with it and a lot of people you know think it's tedious when you reach the end game to not be able to like you know mass build and stuff like that and we we take that into consideration uh part of the game part of what makes this game fun too is like there's two problems math mass building uh there's one where the object constraint limit with the engine that makes if if we enable more people to build bigger things then they're gonna run into that wall much quicker that's one problem the other problem is that um a lot of aspects as to what makes the game fun is the fact that you are you know this pioneer and you're hand selecting stuff and building stuff building up this everything by yourself and like these huge huge bases are really achievements from our players doing all that stuff and uh it's it's scary to remove that aspect of the game because that can really like optimize out the fun another game but we know that it's pretty tedious for a lot of people to do that stuff so we are looking into ways to improve it but i don't know right now what our intentions are um but when we hear you like it's it's not a it's not like a yeah we hear you guys uh and i can't mention i can mention somebody mentioned like the the mods that exist we have looked at the mods and we don't really like the solution um that mods have made um because we feel like like i said before it really optimized like the mods the way they are built right now they optimize out the fun out of the game for us um the way we perceive it and also like i know a lot of people gonna be like no but a lot of people download the mods but our core game player base do not download those mods um so it's it's a it's a shitty answer but uh yeah it's it's like there's always that case when you know we have our opinions of what we don't want to do with the game and what we think are best for the game and then you know you guys definitely have good suggestions too it's not that we're saying like our no our mega brains are we're much since like our mega brains have the right answers and like this is how a game is supposed to be uh every design decision affects a lot of the game and uh it's it's um it's really tricky it's really tricky so that's why we're a bit hesitant to just like throw in you know multi build modes and stuff like that so yeah

> here oh boy cpu multicore the game is already multicore um we can probably improve it a little bit but to my knowledge that there's a the way the game is made it makes it really difficult to like make it more multi-threaded than it already is yeah i think there are some changes coming in the if i remember correctly based on the engine upgrade video which i'll share one more time i think i think there's going to be something that will improve it a bit um but isn't there the instancing can be yeah i think that will actually improve some yeah but that's for that will make rendering better or is that i think it was cpu because i think it had something to do with the conveyor uh oh it might be the driver or something or multi i don't remember no something else okay so check that video out yeah here's the engine upgrade video i think there was something about that in here oh no i put the time stamped one just don't go oh no don't look at it in 14 seconds embarrassing

> you want to make a thing so you can do it um are there any green energy options in the game relative uh news of the game but cold feels bad uh so the thing with green energy is something we've thought about and something that we sort of toss up and oh i'm not sure what we want to do but i think we lean to not doing it but the option is still there and the reason the reason for doing it is because it i don't know it's kind of fun right but the reason to not do it is the point of the game is you work for a company that doesn't give a about the planet and your whole goal is to just exploit the planet at any cost spew carbon up into the air don't care destroy everything cut down every tree kill every creature mine up all the resources yeah um so that is the point of the game that is the story and lore so in order you know if you're gonna invest in green energy it lore wise it doesn't make much sense but if you balance that with fun then maybe it does make sense or maybe it will be a mod like i mean you know video games is escapism right like we we give you this option like you can go and and be as dirty as you want you can roll around in the mud and use coal as much as you go nuclear like do whatever you want and you guys are like no i want to be clean like which is honorable just don't build a factory and don't cut down trees yeah exactly yeah

<summary>A transcript is available</summary>

> um stuff like that um confused on the use of controllers you said that they're not supported but i've been using one since they uh since early access launch should i expect my use of controller to change uh so it's really weird that that's the case because we've um pretty sure we spent literally no time on making that work uh we well we did way back when and then just stop supporting it completely the fact that it works i think is a mere coincidence as for whether it will change in the future i think mappings and things like that might change who knows since it seems to be working by magic anyway uh but um yeah unless i don't think we're gonna remove it like i don't think we're gonna be like delete the support um you know actively go and do that so hopefully it will just keep working for you hopefully we did talk a while back with steam controllers that they were like we had our initial like controller setup that we've we kind of like quite quite abandoned when we were working on because it was so hard to maintain it um but there has been control support like at some point during development and then yep it was too much yeah like you just said uh and then when we were launched on steam there was some issue with like steam controllers not like you could because you can like remap uh on steam in some manner i'm not quite sure how it works yeah yeah you can um and i remember there was some discussion that like if we remove the current controller support then it would be easier to do that remapping or something but maybe we didn't need to or something i don't quite remember but if it works then cool uh yeah i don't know i don't know how it works i don't know why yeah i also don't like because like some things i don't know if you can do on controller like you can't do mass dismantle i think a controller and stuff like that so

> yeah yeah how much is it gonna cost in steam it's the same price we have to we have to keep the same price essentially on both uh platforms so they're always gonna be the same price yeah it's part of the distribution agreement with both epic and steam that you can't like make special deals for your game on different platforms so if you have like a discount on for the game on one platform you have to have it on the other one as well maybe i don't think you have to do it at the same time but you have to have it in like a set amount of like time span or something so you don't feel like one is better than the other yeah
