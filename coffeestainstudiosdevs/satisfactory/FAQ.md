> mass foundation creation um
>
> mark talked about this a while ago like
>
> before holiday vacation
>
> um where we
>
> oh maybe this was a video that jace put
>
> out but we talked about
>
> essentially that we are kind of
>
> considering you know doing some kind of
>
> um not blueprints but like
>
> some kind of similar system or or
>
> something that makes sense in our game
>
> we don't think that blueprints
>
> by like the way the blueprints are like
>
> implemented in other games like factorio
>
> we don't think that makes sense in our
>
> game but we are looking into
>
> you know some kind of similar system to
>
> that
>
> to make late game building more
>
> enjoyable
>
> as you as you may know we're still done
>
> not done with the game there's still a
>
> lot of stuff to do with it and a lot of
>
> people
>
> you know think it's tedious when you
>
> reach the end game to not be able to
>
> like
>
> you know mass build and stuff like that
>
> and we we take that into
>
> consideration uh part of the game part
>
> of what makes this game fun too
>
> is like there's two problems math mass
>
> building
>
> uh there's one where the object
>
> constraint limit with the engine
>
> that makes if if we enable more people
>
> to build bigger things then they're
>
> gonna run into
>
> that wall much quicker that's one
>
> problem the other problem is that
>
> um a lot of aspects as to what makes the
>
> game fun
>
> is the fact that you are you know this
>
> pioneer
>
> and you're hand selecting stuff and
>
> building stuff
>
> building up this everything by yourself
>
> and like these huge
>
> huge bases are really achievements from
>
> our players
>
> doing all that stuff and uh it's it's
>
> scary to remove
>
> that aspect of the game because that can
>
> really like optimize out the fun another
>
> game
>
> but we know that it's pretty tedious for
>
> a lot of people to do that stuff so we
>
> are
>
> looking into ways to improve it but i
>
> don't know
>
> right now what our intentions are um
>
> but when we hear you like it's it's not
>
> a it's not like a
>
> yeah we hear you guys
>
> uh and i can't mention i can mention
>
> somebody mentioned like the
>
> the mods that exist we have looked at
>
> the mods and we don't really like the
>
> solution
>
> um that mods have made
>
> um because we feel like like i said
>
> before it really optimized like the mods
>
> the way they are built right now they
>
> optimize out the fun out of the game for
>
> us
>
> um the way we perceive it and also like
>
> i know a lot of people gonna be like no
>
> but a lot of people download the mods
>
> but
>
> our core game player base do not
>
> download those mods um
>
> so it's it's a it's a shitty answer but
>
> uh
>
> yeah it's it's like there's always that
>
> case when you know we have our opinions
>
> of what we don't want to do with the
>
> game and what we think are best for the
>
> game
>
> and then you know you guys definitely
>
> have good suggestions too it's not that
>
> we're saying like
>
> our no our mega brains are we're much
>
> since like our mega brains have the
>
> right answers
>
> and like this is how a game is supposed
>
> to be uh
>
> every design decision affects a lot of
>
> the game
>
> and uh it's it's um
>
> it's really tricky it's really tricky so
>
> that's why we're a bit hesitant to just
>

>
> something we've thought about and
>
> something that we sort of toss up and oh
>
> i'm not sure what we want to do but i
>
> think we lean to not doing it but the
>
> option is still there
>
> and the reason the reason for doing it
>
> is because it i don't know it's kind of
>
> fun
>
> right but the reason to not do it is the
>
> point of the game
>
> is you work for a company that doesn't
>
> give a about the planet
>
> and your whole goal is to just exploit
>
> the planet
>
> at any cost spew carbon up into the air

>
> you know if you're gonna invest in green
>
> energy it
>
> lore wise it doesn't make much sense but
>
> if you balance that with
>
> fun then maybe it does make sense or

> maybe
>
> it will be a mod like i mean
>
> you know video games is escapism right
>
> like
>
> we we give you this option like you can

> um stuff like that
>
> um confused on the use of controllers
>
> you said that they're not supported but
>
> i've been using one since they
>
> uh since early access launch should i
>
> expect my use of controller to change
>
> uh so it's really weird that that's the
>
> case because we've um pretty sure we
>
> spent
>
> literally no time on making that work
>
> uh we well we did way back when and then
>
> just stop supporting it completely
>
> the fact that it works i think is a mere
>
> coincidence as for whether it will
>
> change in the future i think mappings
>
> and things like that might change
>
> who knows since it seems to be working
>
> by magic anyway uh but
>
> um yeah unless i don't think we're gonna
>
> remove it like i don't think we're gonna
>
> be like
>
> delete the support um you know actively
>
> go and do that
>
> so hopefully it will just keep working
>
> for you hopefully
>
> we did talk a while back with steam
>
> controllers
>
> that they were like we had our initial
>
> like controller
>
> setup that we've we kind of like quite
>
> quite abandoned
>
> when we were working on because it was
>
> so hard to maintain it um
>
> but there has been control support like
>
> at some point during development
>
> and then yep it was too much yeah like
>
> you just said uh
>
> and then when we were launched on steam
>
> there was some issue with like steam
>
> controllers
>
> not like you could because you can like
>
> remap
>
> uh on steam in some manner i'm not quite
>
> sure how it works
>
> yeah yeah you can um and i remember
>
> there was some discussion that like if
>
> we remove
>
> the current controller support then it
>
> would be easier to do that remapping or
>
> something but maybe we didn't need to
>
> or something i don't quite remember but
>
> if it works then cool uh
>
> yeah i don't know i don't know how it
>
> works i don't know why yeah i also don't
>
> like because like some things i don't
>
> know if you can do on controller
>
> like you can't do mass dismantle i think
>
> a controller and stuff like that so
>
> [Music]
