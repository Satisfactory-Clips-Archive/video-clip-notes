### Quotes
> Yeah, MK2 Pipes is also a possibility that might happen before Update 4 - unless they tie in with something in Update 4 that is part of that update so to speak- but if they're not then we're probably going to release MK2 pipes before that or something, I don't know.
---
> Update 4 might happen at the end of 2020, Update 4 might happen at the beginning of 2021 depending on how big it is, and we also don't know if Update 4 is going to be "save everything until Update 4 and release it then" or "release things as we progress" and what that would be.
---
> The game's not dead, there's still cool stuff coming.
