# Topics
Topics should be listed either from [the existing topics](https://github.com/SignpostMarv/twitch-clip-notes/blob/main/coffeestainstudiosdevs/satisfactory/topics.md), or with a new set of preferred topics.
Topics govern what YouTube playlists a video is added to and while playlists on YouTube can't be nested, topics can be manually nested for archival.

# Transcription
Preferred format of manual transcriptions is as follows:
```
Speaker Name: Spoken text with full sentence etc.
Other Name: Spoken text with another full sentence etc.
```
